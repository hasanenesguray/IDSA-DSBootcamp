Love this iPhone I have found the battery life good I have also found the sound excellent when on the phone and listening to music and books however I am disappointed that I cannot get the Kindle app to work not the fault of the phone but Amazon who need to rectify this

Before we start, apologies for the long review, but I hope it's useful! This is a resubmission of my previous review, as for some reason it has disappeared from Amazon….So another year and another iPhone has launched. Now, I have to admit I didn't intend to buy this year, having had the 12 until now. However having my phone stolen, it had to be replaced.This years range is a mild revision over last year but that, in this case, is a good thing! So let’s break it down.Design:This years design borrows a lot from last years, and I think that’s a positive! Now, I know it’s subjective, but one of the things I like about the angular shaping of the 12 & 13 is that they feel less inclined to slip out of your hand. They feel well weighted, light but not excessively so and the anodised aluminium frame feels great in the hand. They also have the benefit of being more durable than previous models due to stronger glass, but it’s always suggested to use a screen protector.As a side note to the design, if you are looking at the 12 cases and wonder if they will fit, I’m afraid to say that they won’t. The camera hump is a slightly different size and has been moved on the back. Just something to be aware of before your new device comes.Performance:This is a area that I can’t say much about, but that’s not a negative. Apple devices, for better and worse, are always faster, smoother and more fluid than their android counterparts. I still have my first gen iPhone SE in the drawer, which I kept as a back up. It’s still snappy, quick and capable of keeping up with the pace of use, even today, so I expect this device to be no different. Scrolling and app opening/closing is buttery smooth, memory is more than adequate and overall it’s a good showing.Battery life:This is one of the areas where the 13 family really takes the lead above it’s previous iterations. Compared to my 12, I am getting at least 20% more screen on time per charge, which is very impressive. In addition, charging time appears to have dropped slightly over last years model, hitting 100% from zero about 10 percent faster than last year.Cameras:Once again, this is a small improvement, but considering the performance ability of the 12’s camera array, we are onto another winner. The main sensor now contains an improved optical image stabilisation system, which now stabilises the whole image sensor and not just the lens. This benefits the user greatly in night shots and if you’re a little shaky when holding the device. The wide angle lens is also a couple of degrees wider than last year. The image processor pulls out more image noise than the 12 too. A solid result.Warranty, support and repairs:One area that stands ahead of most is in the availability of support and repairs. All Apple stores have the ability to complete basic repairs in store, with more complicated ones done off site, can offer software support on site and can even arrange exchanges and replacements. If your phone develops a fault that’s covered under warranty, pop into store and they can sort it out. AppleCare takes this a step further. Say you crack your screen and you have AppleCare…..book a slot at your local store, pay a small excess of £29 (correct at time of writing) and they will replace your screen while you wait. If it can’t be repaired, a new device will be given to you. No other manufacturer offers this level of personal support without sending your phone off for repair, especially if you want it to be done by an official repair centre.Value and competition:I am not someone who buys one brand blindly, rather I choose to select each model by its own merits. Android or Apple, I’m open to all. However, at the 13’s price point, I think it’s far better than it’s main competition, which is the Samsung Galaxy S22. It has stronger battery life, better performance, a more premium build, less lenses but better image quality and overall just takes the crown for the middle to upper middle range for the year. I’m very impressed and hope to keep this one for a few years until something really opens my eyes or turns my head.So there’s a touch into the key areas of the iPhone 13. I hope this was useful to you. Take care and enjoy your summer!

Nice looking phone there seems to be a lot of tin round the sides have to get use to this as my older phone has very little metal in it.

Phone is as expected from an iPhone 13. Not much exciting given Apple aren’t really changing things.My frustration is with the exchange service.I submitted an exchange for my old iPhone X and stated the screen was cracked and was informed unless any other issue I would receive £50.I sent the phone in, it was then returned saying I wouldn’t receive the £50 as the screen was cracked.I have no issue with the reason, however do have issue that I communicated it was cracked and bought the new phone on the basis of an exchange.I’m now unable to exchange the phone elsewhere so effectively have lost £50 due to the lack of commitment.I suggest customers should submit pictures for this service to then commit to an exchange rather than wasting my timeVery poor customer service!

iPhones have a quality feel to them. This one is no different.  The screen is larger vs the phone size than my last iPhone (7) but this is due to the removal of the ‘thumb’ button.  I have to say I did prefer the fingerprint to the Face ID. And in the world of masks (which I still have to use at work) I don’t feel it’s as secure.  Battery life is much better, possibly just because it’s a new phone though.  Storage is also much better.  Other than that, if you’ve owned an iPhone it’s much the same.  If you’re an android person then you’ll probably hate it, else you’d have an iPhone already (and vice Versa!)

My previous phone was an iPhone X and when it finally ceased to work, I invested in an iPhone 13.  It’s only been a couple of weeks since my purchase but battery appears to last longer, camera is excellent !  The processor is faster and the phone is 5G.It’s early days but am very happy.

So far like everything about this phone, first time for an iPhone and am very pleased, read several reviews before deciding which one to go for and this is the one for me.
"
13,B09G95MCDT,4,"
To tell you the truth I do miss my android phone and I would have gotten it rather than the iPhone. I simply chose this because of the price it was more affordable than the Samsung S22 ultra, and I couldn’t wait any longer. If you’re an iPhone lover which clearly I’m not you will enjoy this phone

The blue is truly beautiful and the square edges are great compared to the boring round version s one earlier phones.The operating system is archaic but Apple doesn’t care as it makes so much money. I knew about the cinematic effect on video on this but disregarded it as the usual marketing feature that people get sucked into. It It is anything but. The effect is superb and holding the phone is almost like having a gimbalQuality of detail on wide angle is appalling. It’s like a very heavily compressed jpg from the nineties. I was going to have a mini but obviously cannot compare as I didn’t buy both. Happy with this.
"
17,B09G95MCDT,5,"
I thought it would be more difficult to get used to the new phone and how it works but it was simple enough to adapt from my old iPhone.
"
18,B09G95MCDT,5,"
Although like many ex android users I originally scorned and balked at the idea of paying hundreds of pounds for a phone, I  am now converted. There’s no going back once you’ve got used to the quality of an iPhone. The speed and ease of use is world class and Android can stick it where the sun shines, I’m staying with Apple.
"
19,B09G95MCDT,4,"
Upgraded from iPhone XR, no difference in speed but picture quality is much better on this. If you never had iPhone before than highly recommend

It irritated me that my iPhone XS was not 5G. I decided to get an iPhone 13 and was glad I did. Not only is the battery life much improved, the display is clearer and brighter, but I get 5G!  The the price was not reduced (I bought it after the iPhone 14 was available) but the Amazon 12 months Interest Free helped soften (the price) shock!

It’s an iPhone it’s the same as every phone, if you complain that of this then don’t upgrade every single year… it’s that simple.Last phone was the XR there are loads of amazing changes between both phone. Battery life is excellent.

An Android user since owning an HTC Hero in 2009, I’ve switched to an iPhone 13.I’d been very happy with a Samsung Galaxy S6 and then S8, both bought around a year after release at much reduced price. This time round, last year’s S21 was still pretty expensive and the reviews were disappointing. The new iPhone 13 got great reviews for its camera, reasonable reviews for battery life and it’s not too big (almost the same as my S8) so I switched!I’ve had it for 3 months and I’m very happy with it. It’s easy to use,very responsive and the camera is great. I especially like that I can access the camera with a single left swipe from the Lock Screen. Battery life is good so far, I’m a light user, so I can get two days of use between charges. Hopefully that’ll continue.

Coming from an annoying Galaxy A12 this is day and night. Fantastic premium quality phone I wish I had of got one sooner. Camera and videos are amazing. Was worried about changing to iOS and iPhone but very pleasantly surprised
"
28,B09G95MCDT,5,"
Great value for money at this time of the year considering the 14 has just dropped. Battery so far as well as performance has been great. It's a little bit smaller than expected but none the less still very much worth it.

I decided after many years of Samsung I would try an iPhone again as I had a mac and know it integrates easier. The last iPhone I had was literally 10 years ago so was excited to see how they had progressed. Of course it is very impressive. The camera is amazing and the cinematic mode is mindblowing and of course it’s has loads of amazing features etc but it didn’t take long to start hitting walls where apps were concerned. Stuff that was easy and free and sometimes standard features on my Samsung either didn’t exist or you had to pay for it. Also some usability is not as user friendly as Samsung. I often felt when I was using my Samsung it was like using a laptop. You could browse between pages seamlessly and minimise apps and move between them too. But apple still haven’t been able to manage that. Lots of other stuff like this too. I will probably keep for a year just because I have committed to it now and it might grow on me. However it’s likely I will go back to a Samsung when I can

Only purchased after my Xs max was stolen, wanted to wait till iPhone 14 but having said that this version is a definite improvement over my previous model super slick better screen although slightly smaller (not being a max) battery lasts a couple of days between charges, I would say I’m a light to medium user I don’t use Facebook or the likes just a few what’s app messages Apple Music safari surfing & checking my share prices & call the wife on the way home.Have always used apple products for ease of use I have no problem being locked into their ecosystem & have no intention of moving to android.Would definitely recommend this model, just make sure you get a good case to protect it the screen repair prices are painful.

35,B09G95MCDT,4,"
As an Android user who didn’t have an iPhone since iPhone 4, I wanted to give it another go and the iOs is definitely a lot better now. Love the battery life on my iPhone 13. You can go a full day of heavy heavy use easily. One thing I don’t understand is that still to this date you cannot send pictures through bluetooth to another phone that is on Android… you will need to either send through Whatsapp (where you lose quality of the photo) or you will have to use and pay for a service such as Amazon Photos or google photos etc. Other than that it’s a really good phone but I hate those silly limitations such as the one above from Apple.
"

Bought this when the IPhone 14 came out. Great price from Amazon and hardly any difference from the newly announced 14. Great buy.

Super. Everything is just great. A great gadget at an adequate price.

I decided to make the switch from Android as I was tempted by the excellent camera and premium brand/design.I was a little sad about forfeiting fingerprint ID, 120hz screen & excellent battery life but I need a great camera for work so on balance I went for it.I was disappointed I did. I can't believe a premium phone like this, costing double what my Android did, shipped with a faulty touch screen! It was as if I wasn't touching/tapping it and it was so bad I was intermittently unable to use the phone at all. I literally had to wait, put it down and come back to it, until it was willing to respond. I was okay with the downgrade the other features I mentioned but the touchscreen was kinda essential and therefore a deal-breaker!Thankfully Amazon are arranging a return & refund due the faulty touchscreen. Excellent service there.On the plus side, the photos I took while I had it were excellent as expected and the battery life was noticeably much better than previous iPhones I've used. The AMOLED screen was excellent.I can't comment on the accuracy of Face ID as I was wearing a mask most of the time and had to put my pin in whenever unlocking.If you're coming from an old iPhone you'll love it (if your coming from a nice Android you won't know the difference).
"
39,B09G95MCDT,4,"
I avoided previous iPhones due to how little they advance each time since iPhone 4.This one has flat edges which really improve the quality of the phone.
"
40,B09G95MCDT,3,"
They don't really tell you the Camera, while good, doesn't have optical zoom. This means any zooming is destructive and horrid. The pro is really the finished product. Thats what I should have got. If you don't take many photos, then it's fine. But nothing that much more special than an 11 or 12.
"
41,B09G95MCDT,5,"
Excellent product from Apple but, in my opinion, a little overpriced.  Bought for my wife's birthday and that is what she wanted but I have Samsung.  They are cheaper and just as good.
"
42,B09G95MCDT,5,"
Good job.
"
43,B09G95MCDT,5,"
My note 8 samsung is almost 5 years old and needed a replacement. So went for the iphone 13.Similar priced android phones have a relatively poor battery life and not as impressive camera. There is no telephoto zoom but so far i havent missed it a lot. I like android but have to say im getting fewer malware on ios ( this is my first iphone btw).The camera is stunning.Hope this phone will last another 5 /6 years.

Was initially hesitant on the colour as I thought it would be a little boring but it is really nice. Great size, previously had the XS Max and this was a nice downsize. Takes some stunning photos!
"
46,B09G95MCDT,5,"
I love it ones you have a iPhone it’s hard to replace it no regrets here , just the battery I thought that would keep longer , but if you’re watching videos all the time I guess that’s what happens you need to charge twice a day !
"
47,B09G95MCDT,3,"
Lovely to look at - and Apple user yet I prefer the central finger control. Often pressing screen over and over, rather than once.  Unclear how Apple justify the price.  Come on Apple - if you’re going to upgrade models do it well.

48,B09G95MCDT,5,"
After my iphone x developed a fault so intermittent it could not be found to be fixed I waited to the release of the iphone 13 as it was only a month away I checked the prices of the iphone 12 and for just £50 extra the obvious winner was the 13 with the new battery capacity I can report battery life is huge and quite often I only use 25%of battery each day and that includes using GPS I honestly now never run low on battery none of that topping up during the day stuff After owning a 4s 5 6s and X this upgrade is the best

I really like the pastel pink and attention to detail  258GB. Very easy to set up feels more responsive than iPhone 12 and finally a sim tray from Apple where SIM card clicks in straight away I have struggled in the past with previous iPhones plus fab price on Amazon £100 cheaper than Apple

Upgraded from an ( iPhone 8 plus)This New iPhone 13 (product red) Looks and feels great!-(CAMERA) The camera quality is outstanding, And the ultra wide lense is an extra bonus when needing to take them Wide angle shots. There is a load of other features on the camera that have yet to be tested.-(Display) - The size is perfect being 6.1‑inch, Making gaming on my phone a possibility if i ever want to do that, It Also makes video viewing perfect, And with the display being almost the entire screen, it Keeps me focused on the video/application, The display is very responsive and just feels much cleaner that my previous 8+- No faults, I have yet to find an issue with this iPhone 13, If i do find myself finding issues with this phone, I'll be sure to edit this review.
"
58,B09G95MCDT,4,"
Decent iPhone with good camera (excellent night time photos)Good battery life and charging time.Only criticism is you need to buy a plug for charging - penny pinching by apple considering the cost price hence the deduction of 1 star in overall rating.I purchased the Anker Nano USB C Plug for charging which works well.

Bought an open box deal as a Xmas gift for my daughter. Phone looked ok initially and everything seemed to work except no connection to mobile data so unable to make calls outside of Wi-Fi. Having wasted hours dealing with Amazon, the mobile phone carrier and Apple it transpires the handset has been recorded as lost/stolen so is useless and in effect a paperweight (Apple’s words!!!)I understand an open box deal to mean minor imperfections….not the handset I was sold.So I would be very wary of buying a phone this way as if it has been returned it makes you wonder why. This completely tarnished my daughters Xmas and does not reflect well on Amazon.

Love my new iPhone, been converted to Apple products since early 2000’s.

Very happy with product though. 😁

Box arrived opened with thin slice along of the one protective stickers. Don’t know why Amazon sends such products, but it clearly false advertising!UPDATE:Had long chat with Amazon, got to resolution with them and decided to try this one out.Phone itself, as well as cable seemed untouched. And phone is working well.So if not for opened box it would be good.As a result of resolution increasing to 3 stars. Kudos Amazon support.

Sheeple or advocate, I can’t help it, I like apple products. This is no different, an upgrade for my partners phone, an improved camera, almost a revision back to its earlier design, it’s a nice piece of kit.First time I’ve bought a handset from Amazon, having had a high value item go “AWOL” previously I was impressed by the pin delivery where you have to provide the driver with a code to allow them to handover.

I was forced to upgrade from an ageing iPhone 6s because the battery life had completely died, which I am convinced was almost entirely a function of software. Strange how after every update the battery performance deteriorated.The battery life is good. Pretty much everything else is a big step backwards. There is no fingerprint recognition anymore. It's Face ID. Doesn't work with a facemask which we have to wear these days. Doesn't work with my banking app.They got rid of the home button and have otherwise messed around with the OS. I struggle to access basic features now. You need to flick up or down at just the right place in just the right way rather than just pressing a button.They no longer bother to include a charger, so you need to buy that separately. They got rid of the headphone socket. So you can buy bulky bluetooth earbuds with limited battery life, or pay extra for an adapter, which is what I did.I bought an Apple silicone case. It slightly obstructs the lightning socket to the extent my charger cable won't fit. So every day I need to remove the case to charge it and then put it back on in the morning.On paper the specs are doubtless far superior to my 6s. But in practical terms, before they nixed my battery, the 6s did everything I needed with no fuss. This 13 has lost identifiable features: home button, headphone socket, charger, fingerprint scanner - with no compensation.How long before Apple decides I need to buy another phone and forces an OS update on me that nerfs my battery life?

Am I the only one having sound issues? As I’ve not seen other reviews about this. I usually have to put this on loudspeaker and even after I do, most people complain that they can’t hear me or that the sound is cutting out. Outside Amazon reviews, on Google there were some comments about this, so I’m entirely confused if this is particular to my device or others as well. Anyways I have to return it as there is absolutely no significant difference with the 13 from the 12, or 11 as well.

The phone was great and value for money not bad considering trade in value offered for my old iPhone. They rejected the trade-in saying the camera was not working, which is false. I have pictures taken the day before the  old phone was sent off. Beware of Amazon trade inoffers associated with trade ins. Iam receiving the old phone back and will keep as spare.Old phone received back today and camera works fine so they either did not check it or they had no intention of giving a trade in.

Okay I’ve had the phone for a few months now but there is this one scratch on the screen that has come from nowhere and even with apples “scratch resistant screen” it makes no difference. My iPhone 6 (phone before this 13) had scratches on the back but nothing on the screen. It’s really sad and you can’t see it but you know it’s there , then you look for it. Fine it. Then you are sad again

Arrived next day delivery, easy price plan by dd each month. Really pleased with purchase from this seller. The phone itself is fast, wish that Apple had stuck with touch ID though as if I wear makeup or have hair down it often won’t recognise me.Packaged sympathetically to reduce plastic, no charger just the charging usb cable.

This is my 5th iPhone (13) and to be honest I wouldn’t buy anything else, yes a little expensive but the IOS system is so intuitive and links seamlessly with all my other Apple devices. Still the best Mobile Phone around.

I sent the item back the day after I received it as it was a lot smaller than expected.I packaged it and sent it back 1st class, Amazon have received the item but are requesting 14 working days to issue a refund. 14 working days for a refund is ridiculous.

what an awful phone, since switching from an old Samsung A40 to an I phone 13 , I have had no end of problems, it rings out when it wants to , the other person might hear me but I hear nothing, it blocks websites even official uk org website so unable to access important services, it is not as accessible to switch from text , phone or email, I hate it , what a waste of money, will never get another, the list is so long it’s too much to list , give me a Samsung anyway , hassle , hassle, hassle.

Purchased this about a month ago . I've used android and Apple products before. Simple to set up, runs smoothly. Beautiful vibrant and bright display . I disabled Auto brightness and the display now goes up to 800 nits brightness in manual mode, much brighter than my previous pixel 6 phone ( I found the pixel 6 display a bit dim and lacking brightness, although a good phone) the iphone 13 also goes up to 1200 nits brightness during certain conditions. The camera is good, on a par with my previous pixel 6, video is even better ! It's quite user friendly, albeit not as easy to use as android, I guess it's just different, but easy to adapt to. It's a tad expensive, but I can feel a difference in quality, as in it feels and functions like a high quality device. It also seems fast and responsive! The 60hz display feels smooth, considering other devices have 120hz displays. Face unlock Is fast and has never failed. I would recommend this product!
"
139,B09G95MCDT,5,"
Enjoyed unboxing the phone and couldnt wait too see what the hype was all about. No scratches on the phone and came in perfect condition will definitely be buying one for my son in the near future thank you.
"
140,B09G95MCDT,1,"
Had to send it back and get another one and the new one is just as terrible! So many faults, this is such a waste of money. The torch turns on whenever it pleases, the screen freezes and apps close in the middle of use. Time to move to android.
"
141,B09G95MCDT,5,"
Bought on the apple website during Black Friday sales.Battery life is brilliant - after 2 days of light use it was around 30%. Charges quite quickly. The screen is nice, and camera is great! This is my first time using an iPhone so still getting used to it, but it’s good so far.The Face ID is a bit weird to me, the phone lights up when you look at it but doesn’t always if you’ve not used it for a little while. I think I would probably still prefer finger print ID, but my friend swears by Face ID so I’m trying to get used to it.
"

Waste of space, would not connect via usb or cable to my two Imacs and I was unable to reset. A waste of money and time.Very frustrating and Amazon wanted me to contact Apple, not them, which I would not do, I wanted a phone that will work out of the box for this money.
"
145,B09G95MCDT,1,"
Phone looks nice but is so often getting hot and loses signal which means that I have to turn the phone on and off to get signal back
"
146,B09G95MCDT,1,"
The design reminds of I phone 4. The resolution is improved comparing to my iPhone 11 but feels more bulky in my palm than I phone 11. It arrived without a charger- ?!!!! Nearly 800 pounds for a new phone to buy additionally a charger - I don’t get it. And here comes the nightmare - the battery last a day if not less moderate use - absolutely disgraceful. I will definitely not recommend this product
"
147,B09G95MCDT,1,"
Amazon only offered a repair not a replacement. I have lost confidence in this mobile so I hope they don’t send the mobile back has I would like a brand new phone. Lost trust in that old phone only had this since end of November. Not used till 11 December problems with it since out of the box.
"
148,B09G95MCDT,1,"
The phone wouldn't set up or recognise my Apple ID so had to be returned.I bought insurance with it which is a mistake that requires a different conversation direct with Apple.as masssive pain in the A**S all round
"
149,B09G95MCDT,1,"
I would have liked to review the iPhone 13 but due to theft/fraud, there wasn’t one in the pare I received. This is a perfectly reasonable review, pointing out that not everything on Amazon is as expected, and the customer service to get my money back s utterly disgraceful.
"
150,B09G95MCDT,1,"
Overall this would be a good phone if it wasn’t for the fact that the call quality is terrible.If I could return this I would. I would not recommend you buy it.
"
151,B09G95MCDT,1,"
Ended up returning it - I’ve literally nothing more to say other than it's a small upgrade over iPhone 11, and an even smaller one over iPhone 12.Not worth the money at all. Apple need to up their game.

Hi, recently got an iPhone 13,upgrade from 3 Ireland,not Amazon. Long time Android user,so still getting used to iOS ,no complaints,working just fine,fast system & response to touch & gestures,face recognition I find to be remarkable,& was very easy to configure to my likings & set up from my old android. I'm quite happy & satisfied with it,will revisit this in a few weeks time with an update.

This way a 60th birthday gift for my husband.  NO CONTRACT.Lovely looking phone. Easy to navigate once you get the hang of it. Fabulous functions.So much better than his android.Very slim so the purchase of an i phone 13 wallet case makes it easier to handle and protects it.Shame mobile companies exploit customers with high charges. Amazon were the best price out there even though still pricey . Well done amazon.

I bought this as my iPhone 7 stopped working and here are the reasons I bought a iPhone 13 over the pro and max.Apple ui looks so much better than android.You don’t need a better camera when it’s almost twice the price in the pro or max.120hz display isn’t worth the extra price.Smaller phone is better to hold and use than the max.128gb is enough storage for most people.ProsIt’s FastFast charging with 20w charger.Great UINice new camerasBigger screenCan connect external storage5GSmaller notchPicture in PictureSplit screen appsConsNo charger given to you.No Matt coloursNo telephotoNo 6x optical zoomNo night mode scanner4 not 5 GPUSmaller battery than the Pro maxNo Touch ID instead you have stupid Face IDNo promotion displayNo 3rd cameraNo pro resSoftware updates only last for 7 yearsBattery will need replacing after 3 yearsNo usb cAlthough I’ve listed the cons I think the iPhone is still the best phone that you can buy and you will use every day but I’d get the standard iPhone 13 because the max and pro are a rip off the price has become to high for very little extra features compared with the standard phone.And like all smart phones there’s nothing much new each year it’s just new software that improves the features so if you can wait another year buy the iPhone 14 which will possibly have the following.USB cTouch idNo notch screenBattery cameras

Recently i upgrade to iPhone 13 pro. I have been using this from 5 days. Battery is something I’m not really convinced with it. This is the first time I had this experience I bought a new product and the batter is not really up to the make. May be it’s because of the 5G. But it is bit disappointing, we can’t live in fear we have turn in dark mode, make changes in location, look for videos on YouTube how save battery. Camera quality, built quickly software easy to use iOS15. That’s my honest review about iPhone 13pro 256gb
"
160,B09G95MCDT,1,"
I bought this and had to return it,  main problem, I thought the camera was poor,  not as good as my 2 year old se model,  it struggled to focus on anything close up,  it is already partially zoomed at x1, so that does not help,the wide shot mode is utterly pointless, and make photos look strange,The photos often look false and over processed,I did a test with a photo group I am in,  I posted 2 identical photos, one with my old se model,And one with the iPhone 13,  I did not tell anyone what phones I had taken the photos with,I just asked them to say which was best,Not one person out of a big group, not one chose the I phone 13,Everyone said the iPhone se photo was better, sharper, more natural looking photo.So iPhone 13 is a very expensive downgrade in my opinion, and I was glad to see the back of it,I would not recommend this phone if like me, you use it more as a camera than a phone.It seems Apple have forgotten how to do a good upgrade,Considering how much this phone is,  If it was £400 it would be nearer the Mark, but over £700,It’s a expensive joke.
"
161,B09G95MCDT,5,"
Whilst it may be an incremental upgrade over the 12 three key areas have been substantially improved; storage, battery and camera. Face ID still the best. Perfect size - not a slab. It's the overall best phone with a sensibly-sized form factor. The negatives? In an era of 65W charging by the likes Of OnePlus the iPhone charges at a snail's pace - wirelessly it's ridiculously slow. 1200 Htz screen refresh only available on Pro models. Still no USB-C charging. Whilst smaller, the notch is beginning to look ridiculous. No fingerprint reader.

This not my 1st iPhone my last iPhone was 6s before I switch to android  “Samsung” in 2018.Now I switch back to iPhone as I missed iOS in past 3 years.Last time I had 64gb on the iPhone 6s that was not good for me as not much GB so, this time I those 512gb and it is my biggest GB I ever had on my iPhone 13!I love the color pink I never chose pink color before last time I had Space Grey on iPhone 6s I am guy so, why not. Pink color look amazing!The iOS software change in passed 3 year since iOS 11. iOS 15 is really good software I love it.The camera look fab can’t wait to record it for my YouTube Channel!For me I missed iPhone in passed 3 year.Overall Apple did the great jobs. 👍Can’t wait my next iPhone in 2023!

While the phone arrived unlocked and in good condition, my SIM wasn’t working. I contacted my network who advised that the phone had been blacklisted as it had previously been reported as stolen by its original owner. Phone therefore couldn’t be used and had to be returned.

I was thinking of getting the Pro, but couldn’t justify the cost. I moved up from an iPhone X and love this model way better. The screen is so bright and colourful with excellent blacks. It films video in 4K Dolby Vision and is a must have phone for filming interviews or mini documentaries. Having two lenses is enough for me. I’ve blown the footage up and it has clarity as well as great audio, even in noisy environments. I work in media and can’t always carry a big camera around. This is great backup for those situations when my gear isn’t with me.I shot the attached photos in pitch black and was amazed at the results. Portrait photos are astonishing too. Just remember to keep the filter on normal (default). The others aren’t always reliable. You don’t need any post production either and the depth of field (background blur) is brilliant. At this rate there’ll be no need for cameras anymore in the future. Obviously a good camera is better right now, but the output of this iPhone is very usable.When watching movies, the image is sharp and vibrant with amazing sound. Watching movie trailers YouTube is such a different experience now. I can’t believe these tiny speakers are so loud and clear.At this price, there’s no better value and with the processor/gpu power, you can use photo and video editing software with ease. It’s just so powerful. I recommend it to everyone, especially with the crystal clear FaceTime front camera.
"
166,B09G95MCDT,5,"
Upgraded my Iphone SE 2020 for this. It's so powerful - great longer battery life and so much faster......By no means cheap, but it feels much more robust in the hand, has twice the storage capacity too at 128GB, and looks amazing. I'm not too fussed about the apparently great camera but I guess that will be nice too! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
"
167,B09G95MCDT,5,"
Image and state of the art gadgets, phones etc have not been a priority in using technology, If it ain’t broken don’t fix it. Well my old phone was broken the screen was turning into a mosaic with shards of glass desperately trying to sneak through the screen cover. It was tired and worn out, so, tine for a new model. I have a sim only contract as I prefer to own my phone & upgrade it if & when I like. Time to venture into the land of Apple iPhones, I have had an iPad for a few years, love the speed of it compared to Android. The iPhone 13 has the same speed & qualities and I am really impressed with it. It is the only phone we use, no landline. The apps are quick to open, the camera is much better quality and the aesthetics are clean and streamlined. It has a bigger screen size than my old phone all the better for us oldies and having arthritis in my hands it is easier to grip the larger size. Transferring files, settings, apps etc was a doddle. Storage capacity much bigger than I am used to. All in all I am delighted with my new phone and hope to be using it for a long while to cone,

This is my first iPhone after years of Android use. iOS is quite different, but it works fine, once you wrap your head around it. The phone itself is excellent. Beautiful to look at and listen to, incidentally. Great camera, fairly lightweight and it feels well made. It definitely lives up to the hype. Clever too that if it’s close to my iPad or MacBook, I can make or receive calls on any of them. A few foibles. You can’t just start typing a name on the phone keypad to bring up a number, Android style, and it took me a while to realise you need to press and hold to move the cursor when you’re editing text like this review. But it’s minor stuff. If you can stomach the price (which was considerably discounted here - thanks, Amazon), then you won’t be disappointed.EDIT: I’ve found a way to speed up dialling my main contacts. You can use shortcuts to build a speed dial menu which you can access via an icon on your Home Screen. Thank-you, YouTube!

Can this phone make and receive a call? Yes. Like most phones it can. So why have I rated it so badly? First of all the Face ID is a terrible idea and nobody tells you that until you’ve got one. Face ID does not work in horizontal mode so you are forever having to grab the phone and hold it vertically to open the phone after it goes to sleep. It is so annoying. Befits you’d just reach across with your finger. To actually pick it up and look at the phone is nuts. Next. To operate the phone you are for ever trying to remember all the new slide combinations to access things that before were so easy to do. For instance Square crop on photos is no longer available unless you swipe up but only in a certain area. If I could I would throw this phone in the bin and go back to my 6s which was a far better phone. Don’t buy this phone. Apple are washed up. There era is over.

178,B09G95MCDT,5,"
That's ever best phone i boutght. This is to fast, 5G works fine, its nice size and not weight. I have choosen the blue one with 128GB, i guess with the 5G and cloud storage its enought. So that's my opinion about.

The iPhone 13 has the same design as last year’s iPhone 12 model, but it's internally where the differences can be found.  One of the key internal changes being an improved camera where Apple have taken last year’s much praised iPhone 12 Pro Max wide camera lens and put it into the iPhone 13... and the images are fantastic!Another key improvement is Apples new A15 bionic chip with a 6 core CPU, 4 core GPU and 4Gb of RAM (in the iPhone 13).  Currently, the A15 Bionic chip is the fastest smartphone chip in the world meaning it can handle the most demanding apps/processes and still has room to spare.It also means Apple will continue to support the iPhone 13 with software (iOS) updates for 5 to 6 years, longer than any other smartphone manufacturer.  so if you are looking for a future proof, then that's what you will be doing by buying this.The battery is also very good.  I'm not a heavy phone user but I've become accustomed to ensuring I have a charger close by 'in case' I need it, whereas with the iPhone 13 I'm comfortably getting through the day without needing to charge it... and on a several occasions into the next day too.The main differences between the iPhone 13 and iPhone Pro, or Pro Max, are:- Graphics:  The iPhone 13 has a 4 core GPU where the Pro has a 5 core GPU- Display:  The iPhone 13 has a 60Hz refresh display where the Pro has ProMotion, an adaptive display which ranges from 10 to 120Hz depending on what you are looking at or doing- Battery:  The iPhone 13 has an estimated 15 hours of continuous streaming and the Pro as 20 hours- Camera:  The iPhone 13 has a Wide Camera lens and an Ultra-Wide camera lens, where the Pro has a Wide, Ultra-Wide and a Telephoto camera lens.The Pro models also have macro photography thanks to a new Ultra-Wide camera lens which take stunning images.Overall, the iPhone 13 is a fantastic phone and ideal for anyone wanting to:a) Upgrade from a phone older than the iPhone 11b) Looking for the most future proof smart phone they can getc) Are not fussed by telephoto or macro photographyLastly, I’ve attached 5 photo examples of Photographic Styles, new feature to the iPhone 13 range.

The phone arrived in a cheap box, looking very chinesey, I then noticed the box was not sealed in any way, I opened the box, the phone was the wrong way round, it's got smudges all over it. REALLY SUSPECT

This review is for the Apple iPhone 13 (128GB) - Starlight.Another amazing phone from Apple. Lovely designed and works great. I upgraded from a iPhone 7+ and there is a world of difference in speed and features! Fantastic and worth every penny. Should keep me going for another 5 years!Update after using for a week: still love it! iOS 15 is great love the additions to the weather app and how you listen to your voicemails. 👍🏻👍🏻2 weeks update.. still going well! So much better than my iPhone 7+

Lovely phone beautiful made in a combined glass mineral and aluminium construction. Easy to use with a lot of thought that has gone into how this works embracing the very best of the latest technology. Very delighted with it. But, after setting it up on the day I received it, it started an update to IOS 15.4.1. The next day it was bricked! I tried hardware resets many times, updates through iTunes over and over and factory resets many many times. In the end I have had to send the phone off to Apple to be repaired. I still think this is a good phone though. And online Apple support is really good. But I can't help feeling disappointed that this can happen.As an update, Apple fixed this very quickly. Very impressed and a great phone! Added a well deserved star because of the superb product supported by a superb service.

Rivedo il mio primo giudizio. Dopo due anni dì pandemia il Face ID è decisamente superato. Meglio un bel Touch ID o un riconoscimento biometrico oculare, per esempio. Anche la tastiera va migliorata. È inaccettabile il continuo swap tra lettere e numeri.Primo commento: Non avrei mai pensato di innamorarmi di un cellulare 😅. È semplicemente perfetto, e il colore è fuori di testa! Spedizione impeccabile come sempre

Before we start, apologies for the long review, but I hope it's useful! This is a resubmission of my previous review, as for some reason it has disappeared from Amazon….So another year and another iPhone has launched. Now, I have to admit I didn't intend to buy this year, having had the 12 until now. However having my phone stolen, it had to be replaced.This years range is a mild revision over last year but that, in this case, is a good thing! So let’s break it down.Design:This years design borrows a lot from last years, and I think that’s a positive! Now, I know it’s subjective, but one of the things I like about the angular shaping of the 12 & 13 is that they feel less inclined to slip out of your hand. They feel well weighted, light but not excessively so and the anodised aluminium frame feels great in the hand. They also have the benefit of being more durable than previous models due to stronger glass, but it’s always suggested to use a screen protector.As a side note to the design, if you are looking at the 12 cases and wonder if they will fit, I’m afraid to say that they won’t. The camera hump is a slightly different size and has been moved on the back. Just something to be aware of before your new device comes.Performance:This is a area that I can’t say much about, but that’s not a negative. Apple devices, for better and worse, are always faster, smoother and more fluid than their android counterparts. I still have my first gen iPhone SE in the drawer, which I kept as a back up. It’s still snappy, quick and capable of keeping up with the pace of use, even today, so I expect this device to be no different. Scrolling and app opening/closing is buttery smooth, memory is more than adequate and overall it’s a good showing.Battery life:This is one of the areas where the 13 family really takes the lead above it’s previous iterations. Compared to my 12, I am getting at least 20% more screen on time per charge, which is very impressive. In addition, charging time appears to have dropped slightly over last years model, hitting 100% from zero about 10 percent faster than last year.Cameras:Once again, this is a small improvement, but considering the performance ability of the 12’s camera array, we are onto another winner. The main sensor now contains an improved optical image stabilisation system, which now stabilises the whole image sensor and not just the lens. This benefits the user greatly in night shots and if you’re a little shaky when holding the device. The wide angle lens is also a couple of degrees wider than last year. The image processor pulls out more image noise than the 12 too. A solid result.Warranty, support and repairs:One area that stands ahead of most is in the availability of support and repairs. All Apple stores have the ability to complete basic repairs in store, with more complicated ones done off site, can offer software support on site and can even arrange exchanges and replacements. If your phone develops a fault that’s covered under warranty, pop into store and they can sort it out. AppleCare takes this a step further. Say you crack your screen and you have AppleCare…..book a slot at your local store, pay a small excess of £29 (correct at time of writing) and they will replace your screen while you wait. If it can’t be repaired, a new device will be given to you. No other manufacturer offers this level of personal support without sending your phone off for repair, especially if you want it to be done by an official repair centre.Value and competition:I am not someone who buys one brand blindly, rather I choose to select each model by its own merits. Android or Apple, I’m open to all. However, at the 13’s price point, I think it’s far better than it’s main competition, which is the Samsung Galaxy S22. It has stronger battery life, better performance, a more premium build, less lenses but better image quality and overall just takes the crown for the middle to upper middle range for the year. I’m very impressed and hope to keep this one for a few years until something really opens my eyes or turns my head.So there’s a touch into the key areas of the iPhone 13. I hope this was useful to you. Take care and enjoy your summer!

Phone is as expected from an iPhone 13. Not much exciting given Apple aren’t really changing things.My frustration is with the exchange service.I submitted an exchange for my old iPhone X and stated the screen was cracked and was informed unless any other issue I would receive £50.I sent the phone in, it was then returned saying I wouldn’t receive the £50 as the screen was cracked.I have no issue with the reason, however do have issue that I communicated it was cracked and bought the new phone on the basis of an exchange.I’m now unable to exchange the phone elsewhere so effectively have lost £50 due to the lack of commitment.I suggest customers should submit pictures for this service to then commit to an exchange rather than wasting my timeVery poor customer service!

iPhones have a quality feel to them. This one is no different.  The screen is larger vs the phone size than my last iPhone (7) but this is due to the removal of the ‘thumb’ button.  I have to say I did prefer the fingerprint to the Face ID. And in the world of masks (which I still have to use at work) I don’t feel it’s as secure.  Battery life is much better, possibly just because it’s a new phone though.  Storage is also much better.  Other than that, if you’ve owned an iPhone it’s much the same.  If you’re an android person then you’ll probably hate it, else you’d have an iPhone already (and vice Versa!)

My previous phone was an iPhone X and when it finally ceased to work, I invested in an iPhone 13.  It’s only been a couple of weeks since my purchase but battery appears to last longer, camera is excellent !  The processor is faster and the phone is 5G.It’s early days but am very happy.

To tell you the truth I do miss my android phone and I would have gotten it rather than the iPhone. I simply chose this because of the price it was more affordable than the Samsung S22 ultra, and I couldn’t wait any longer. If you’re an iPhone lover which clearly I’m not you will enjoy this phone

The blue is truly beautiful and the square edges are great compared to the boring round version s one earlier phones.The operating system is archaic but Apple doesn’t care as it makes so much money. I knew about the cinematic effect on video on this but disregarded it as the usual marketing feature that people get sucked into. It It is anything but. The effect is superb and holding the phone is almost like having a gimbalQuality of detail on wide angle is appalling. It’s like a very heavily compressed jpg from the nineties. I was going to have a mini but obviously cannot compare as I didn’t buy both. Happy with this.
"

Although like many ex android users I originally scorned and balked at the idea of paying hundreds of pounds for a phone, I  am now converted. There’s no going back once you’ve got used to the quality of an iPhone. The speed and ease of use is world class and Android can stick it where the sun shines, I’m staying with Apple.

It irritated me that my iPhone XS was not 5G. I decided to get an iPhone 13 and was glad I did. Not only is the battery life much improved, the display is clearer and brighter, but I get 5G!  The the price was not reduced (I bought it after the iPhone 14 was available) but the Amazon 12 months Interest Free helped soften (the price) shock!

An Android user since owning an HTC Hero in 2009, I’ve switched to an iPhone 13.I’d been very happy with a Samsung Galaxy S6 and then S8, both bought around a year after release at much reduced price. This time round, last year’s S21 was still pretty expensive and the reviews were disappointing. The new iPhone 13 got great reviews for its camera, reasonable reviews for battery life and it’s not too big (almost the same as my S8) so I switched!I’ve had it for 3 months and I’m very happy with it. It’s easy to use,very responsive and the camera is great. I especially like that I can access the camera with a single left swipe from the Lock Screen. Battery life is good so far, I’m a light user, so I can get two days of use between charges. Hopefully that’ll continue.

Great value for money at this time of the year considering the 14 has just dropped. Battery so far as well as performance has been great. It's a little bit smaller than expected but none the less still very much worth it.

I decided after many years of Samsung I would try an iPhone again as I had a mac and know it integrates easier. The last iPhone I had was literally 10 years ago so was excited to see how they had progressed. Of course it is very impressive. The camera is amazing and the cinematic mode is mindblowing and of course it’s has loads of amazing features etc but it didn’t take long to start hitting walls where apps were concerned. Stuff that was easy and free and sometimes standard features on my Samsung either didn’t exist or you had to pay for it. Also some usability is not as user friendly as Samsung. I often felt when I was using my Samsung it was like using a laptop. You could browse between pages seamlessly and minimise apps and move between them too. But apple still haven’t been able to manage that. Lots of other stuff like this too. I will probably keep for a year just because I have committed to it now and it might grow on me. However it’s likely I will go back to a Samsung when I can

Only purchased after my Xs max was stolen, wanted to wait till iPhone 14 but having said that this version is a definite improvement over my previous model super slick better screen although slightly smaller (not being a max) battery lasts a couple of days between charges, I would say I’m a light to medium user I don’t use Facebook or the likes just a few what’s app messages Apple Music safari surfing & checking my share prices & call the wife on the way home.Have always used apple products for ease of use I have no problem being locked into their ecosystem & have no intention of moving to android.Would definitely recommend this model, just make sure you get a good case to protect it the screen repair prices are painful.

249,B09G9HQHRH,4,"
As an Android user who didn’t have an iPhone since iPhone 4, I wanted to give it another go and the iOs is definitely a lot better now. Love the battery life on my iPhone 13. You can go a full day of heavy heavy use easily. One thing I don’t understand is that still to this date you cannot send pictures through bluetooth to another phone that is on Android… you will need to either send through Whatsapp (where you lose quality of the photo) or you will have to use and pay for a service such as Amazon Photos or google photos etc. Other than that it’s a really good phone but I hate those silly limitations such as the one above from Apple.

I decided to make the switch from Android as I was tempted by the excellent camera and premium brand/design.I was a little sad about forfeiting fingerprint ID, 120hz screen & excellent battery life but I need a great camera for work so on balance I went for it.I was disappointed I did. I can't believe a premium phone like this, costing double what my Android did, shipped with a faulty touch screen! It was as if I wasn't touching/tapping it and it was so bad I was intermittently unable to use the phone at all. I literally had to wait, put it down and come back to it, until it was willing to respond. I was okay with the downgrade the other features I mentioned but the touchscreen was kinda essential and therefore a deal-breaker!Thankfully Amazon are arranging a return & refund due the faulty touchscreen. Excellent service there.On the plus side, the photos I took while I had it were excellent as expected and the battery life was noticeably much better than previous iPhones I've used. The AMOLED screen was excellent.I can't comment on the accuracy of Face ID as I was wearing a mask most of the time and had to put my pin in whenever unlocking.If you're coming from an old iPhone you'll love it (if your coming from a nice Android you won't know the difference).
"
253,B09G9HQHRH,4,"
I avoided previous iPhones due to how little they advance each time since iPhone 4.This one has flat edges which really improve the quality of the phone.
"
254,B09G9HQHRH,3,"
They don't really tell you the Camera, while good, doesn't have optical zoom. This means any zooming is destructive and horrid. The pro is really the finished product. Thats what I should have got. If you don't take many photos, then it's fine. But nothing that much more special than an 11 or 12.
"
255,B09G9HQHRH,5,"
Excellent product from Apple but, in my opinion, a little overpriced.  Bought for my wife's birthday and that is what she wanted but I have Samsung.  They are cheaper and just as good.

My note 8 samsung is almost 5 years old and needed a replacement. So went for the iphone 13.Similar priced android phones have a relatively poor battery life and not as impressive camera. There is no telephoto zoom but so far i havent missed it a lot.

I love it ones you have a iPhone it’s hard to replace it no regrets here , just the battery I thought that would keep longer , but if you’re watching videos all the time I guess that’s what happens you need to charge twice a day !

Lovely to look at - and Apple user yet I prefer the central finger control. Often pressing screen over and over, rather than once.  Unclear how Apple justify the price.  Come on Apple - if you’re going to upgrade models do it well.

After my iphone x developed a fault so intermittent it could not be found to be fixed I waited to the release of the iphone 13 as it was only a month away I checked the prices of the iphone 12 and for just £50 extra the obvious winner was the 13 with the new battery capacity I can report battery life is huge and quite often I only use 25%of battery each day and that includes using GPS I honestly now never run low on battery none of that topping up during the day stuff After owning a 4s 5 6s and X this upgrade is the best

Upgraded from an ( iPhone 8 plus)This New iPhone 13 (product red) Looks and feels great!-(CAMERA) The camera quality is outstanding, And the ultra wide lense is an extra bonus when needing to take them Wide angle shots. There is a load of other features on the camera that have yet to be tested.-(Display) - The size is perfect being 6.1‑inch, Making gaming on my phone a possibility if i ever want to do that, It Also makes video viewing perfect, And with the display being almost the entire screen, it Keeps me focused on the video/application, The display is very responsive and just feels much cleaner that my previous 8+- No faults, I have yet to find an issue with this iPhone 13, If i do find myself finding issues with this phone, I'll be sure to edit this review.

Decent iPhone with good camera (excellent night time photos)Good battery life and charging time.Only criticism is you need to buy a plug for charging - penny pinching by apple considering the cost price hence the deduction of 1 star in overall rating.I purchased the Anker Nano USB C Plug for charging which works well.

Bought an open box deal as a Xmas gift for my daughter. Phone looked ok initially and everything seemed to work except no connection to mobile data so unable to make calls outside of Wi-Fi. Having wasted hours dealing with Amazon, the mobile phone carrier and Apple it transpires the handset has been recorded as lost/stolen so is useless and in effect a paperweight (Apple’s words!!!)I understand an open box deal to mean minor imperfections….not the handset I was sold.So I would be very wary of buying a phone this way as if it has been returned it makes you wonder why. This completely tarnished my daughters Xmas and does not reflect well on Amazon.

I was forced to upgrade from an ageing iPhone 6s because the battery life had completely died, which I am convinced was almost entirely a function of software. Strange how after every update the battery performance deteriorated.The battery life is good. Pretty much everything else is a big step backwards. There is no fingerprint recognition anymore. It's Face ID. Doesn't work with a facemask which we have to wear these days. Doesn't work with my banking app.They got rid of the home button and have otherwise messed around with the OS. I struggle to access basic features now. You need to flick up or down at just the right place in just the right way rather than just pressing a button.They no longer bother to include a charger, so you need to buy that separately. They got rid of the headphone socket. So you can buy bulky bluetooth earbuds with limited battery life, or pay extra for an adapter, which is what I did.I bought an Apple silicone case. It slightly obstructs the lightning socket to the extent my charger cable won't fit. So every day I need to remove the case to charge it and then put it back on in the morning.On paper the specs are doubtless far superior to my 6s. But in practical terms, before they nixed my battery, the 6s did everything I needed with no fuss. This 13 has lost identifiable features: home button, headphone socket, charger, fingerprint scanner - with no compensation.How long before Apple decides I need to buy another phone and forces an OS update on me that nerfs my battery life?

Am I the only one having sound issues? As I’ve not seen other reviews about this. I usually have to put this on loudspeaker and even after I do, most people complain that they can’t hear me or that the sound is cutting out. Outside Amazon reviews, on Google there were some comments about this, so I’m entirely confused if this is particular to my device or others as well. Anyways I have to return it as there is absolutely no significant difference with the 13 from the 12, or 11 as well.

The phone was great and value for money not bad considering trade in value offered for my old iPhone. They rejected the trade-in saying the camera was not working, which is false. I have pictures taken the day before the  old phone was sent off. Beware of Amazon trade inoffers associated with trade ins. Iam receiving the old phone back and will keep as spare.Old phone received back today and camera works fine so they either did not check it or they had no intention of giving a trade in.

Okay I’ve had the phone for a few months now but there is this one scratch on the screen that has come from nowhere and even with apples “scratch resistant screen” it makes no difference. My iPhone 6 (phone before this 13) had scratches on the back but nothing on the screen. It’s really sad and you can’t see it but you know it’s there , then you look for it. Fine it. Then you are sad again

Arrived next day delivery, easy price plan by dd each month. Really pleased with purchase from this seller. The phone itself is fast, wish that Apple had stuck with touch ID though as if I wear makeup or have hair down it often won’t recognise me.Packaged sympathetically to reduce plastic, no charger just the charging usb cable. The box was also well packaged and product was undamaged, carefully delivered by person to person.

Purchased this about a month ago . I've used android and Apple products before. Simple to set up, runs smoothly. Beautiful vibrant and bright display . I disabled Auto brightness and the display now goes up to 800 nits brightness in manual mode, much brighter than my previous pixel 6 phone ( I found the pixel 6 display a bit dim and lacking brightness, although a good phone) the iphone 13 also goes up to 1200 nits brightness during certain conditions. The camera is good, on a par with my previous pixel 6, video is even better ! It's quite user friendly, albeit not as easy to use as android, I guess it's just different, but easy to adapt to. It's a tad expensive, but I can feel a difference in quality, as in it feels and functions like a high quality device. It also seems fast and responsive! The 60hz display feels smooth, considering other devices have 120hz displays. Face unlock Is fast and has never failed. I would recommend this product!
"
353,B09G9HQHRH,5,"
Enjoyed unboxing the phone and couldnt wait too see what the hype was all about. No scratches on the phone and came in perfect condition will definitely be buying one for my son in the near future thank you.

Had to send it back and get another one and the new one is just as terrible! So many faults, this is such a waste of money. The torch turns on whenever it pleases, the screen freezes and apps close in the middle of use. Time to move to android.

355,B09G9HQHRH,5,"
Bought on the apple website during Black Friday sales.Battery life is brilliant - after 2 days of light use it was around 30%. Charges quite quickly. The screen is nice, and camera is great! This is my first time using an iPhone so still getting used to it, but it’s good so far.The Face ID is a bit weird to me, the phone lights up when you look at it but doesn’t always if you’ve not used it for a little while. I think I would probably still prefer finger print ID, but my friend swears by Face ID so I’m trying to get used to it.

Waste of space, would not connect via usb or cable to my two Imacs and I was unable to reset. A waste of money and time.Very frustrating and Amazon wanted me to contact Apple, not them, which I would not do, I wanted a phone that will work out of the box for this money.

Phone looks nice but is so often getting hot and loses signal which means that I have to turn the phone on and off to get signal back

The design reminds of I phone 4. The resolution is improved comparing to my iPhone 11 but feels more bulky in my palm than I phone 11. It arrived without a charger- ?!!!! Nearly 800 pounds for a new phone to buy additionally a charger - I don’t get it. And here comes the nightmare - the battery last a day if not less moderate use - absolutely disgraceful. I will definitely not recommend this product
"
361,B09G9HQHRH,1,"
Amazon only offered a repair not a replacement. I have lost confidence in this mobile so I hope they don’t send the mobile back has I would like a brand new phone. Lost trust in that old phone only had this since end of November. Not used till 11 December problems with it since out of the box.
"
362,B09G9HQHRH,1,"
The phone wouldn't set up or recognise my Apple ID so had to be returned.I bought insurance with it which is a mistake that requires a different conversation direct with Apple.as masssive pain in the A**S all round
"
363,B09G9HQHRH,1,"
I would have liked to review the iPhone 13 but due to theft/fraud, there wasn’t one in the pare I received. This is a perfectly reasonable review, pointing out that not everything on Amazon is as expected, and the customer service to get my money back s utterly disgraceful.
"
364,B09G9HQHRH,1,"
Overall this would be a good phone if it wasn’t for the fact that the call quality is terrible.If I could return this I would. I would not recommend you buy it.
"
365,B09G9HQHRH,1,"
Ended up returning it - I’ve literally nothing more to say other than it's a small upgrade over iPhone 11, and an even smaller one over iPhone 12.Not worth the money at all. Apple need to up their game.

This way a 60th birthday gift for my husband.  NO CONTRACT.Lovely looking phone. Easy to navigate once you get the hang of it. Fabulous functions.So much better than his android.Very slim so the purchase of an i phone 13 wallet case makes it easier to handle and protects it.Shame mobile companies exploit customers with high charges. Amazon were the best price out there even though still pricey . Well done amazon.

I bought this as my iPhone 7 stopped working and here are the reasons I bought a iPhone 13 over the pro and max.Apple ui looks so much better than android.You don’t need a better camera when it’s almost twice the price in the pro or max.120hz display isn’t worth the extra price.Smaller phone is better to hold and use than the max.128gb is enough storage for most people.ProsIt’s FastFast charging with 20w charger.Great UINice new camerasBigger screenCan connect external storage5GSmaller notchPicture in PictureSplit screen appsConsNo charger given to you.No Matt coloursNo telephotoNo 6x optical zoomNo night mode scanner4 not 5 GPUSmaller battery than the Pro maxNo Touch ID instead you have stupid Face IDNo promotion displayNo 3rd cameraNo pro resSoftware updates only last for 7 yearsBattery will need replacing after 3 yearsNo usb cAlthough I’ve listed the cons I think the iPhone is still the best phone that you can buy and you will use every day but I’d get the standard iPhone 13 because the max and pro are a rip off the price has become to high for very little extra features compared with the standard phone.And like all smart phones there’s nothing much new each year it’s just new software that improves the features so if you can wait another year buy the iPhone 14 which will possibly have the following.USB cTouch idNo notch screenBattery cameras

Recently i upgrade to iPhone 13 pro. I have been using this from 5 days. Battery is something I’m not really convinced with it. This is the first time I had this experience I bought a new product and the batter is not really up to the make. May be it’s because of the 5G. But it is bit disappointing, we can’t live in fear we have turn in dark mode, make changes in location, look for videos on YouTube how save battery. Camera quality, built quickly software easy to use iOS15. That’s my honest review about iPhone 13pro 256gb
"
374,B09G9HQHRH,1,"
I bought this and had to return it,  main problem, I thought the camera was poor,  not as good as my 2 year old se model,  it struggled to focus on anything close up,  it is already partially zoomed at x1, so that does not help,the wide shot mode is utterly pointless, and make photos look strange,The photos often look false and over processed,I did a test with a photo group I am in,  I posted 2 identical photos, one with my old se model,And one with the iPhone 13,  I did not tell anyone what phones I had taken the photos with,I just asked them to say which was best,Not one person out of a big group, not one chose the I phone 13,Everyone said the iPhone se photo was better, sharper, more natural looking photo.So iPhone 13 is a very expensive downgrade in my opinion, and I was glad to see the back of it,I would not recommend this phone if like me, you use it more as a camera than a phone.It seems Apple have forgotten how to do a good upgrade,Considering how much this phone is,  If it was £400 it would be nearer the Mark, but over £700,It’s a expensive joke.
"
375,B09G9HQHRH,5,"
Whilst it may be an incremental upgrade over the 12 three key areas have been substantially improved; storage, battery and camera. Face ID still the best. Perfect size - not a slab. It's the overall best phone with a sensibly-sized form factor. The negatives? In an era of 65W charging by the likes Of OnePlus the iPhone charges at a snail's pace - wirelessly it's ridiculously slow. 1200 Htz screen refresh only available on Pro models. Still no USB-C charging. Whilst smaller, the notch is beginning to look ridiculous. No fingerprint reader.

This not my 1st iPhone my last iPhone was 6s before I switch to android  “Samsung” in 2018.Now I switch back to iPhone as I missed iOS in past 3 years.Last time I had 64gb on the iPhone 6s that was not good for me as not much GB so, this time I those 512gb and it is my biggest GB I ever had on my iPhone 13!I love the color pink I never chose pink color before last time I had Space Grey on iPhone 6s I am guy so, why not. Pink color look amazing!The iOS software change in passed 3 year since iOS 11. iOS 15 is really good software I love it.The camera look fab can’t wait to record it for my YouTube Channel!For me I missed iPhone in passed 3 year.Overall Apple did the great jobs. 👍Can’t wait my next iPhone in 2023!

I was thinking of getting the Pro, but couldn’t justify the cost. I moved up from an iPhone X and love this model way better. The screen is so bright and colourful with excellent blacks. It films video in 4K Dolby Vision and is a must have phone for filming interviews or mini documentaries. Having two lenses is enough for me. I’ve blown the footage up and it has clarity as well as great audio, even in noisy environments. I work in media and can’t always carry a big camera around. This is great backup for those situations when my gear isn’t with me.I shot the attached photos in pitch black and was amazed at the results. Portrait photos are astonishing too. Just remember to keep the filter on normal (default). The others aren’t always reliable. You don’t need any post production either and the depth of field (background blur) is brilliant. At this rate there’ll be no need for cameras anymore in the future. Obviously a good camera is better right now, but the output of this iPhone is very usable.When watching movies, the image is sharp and vibrant with amazing sound. Watching movie trailers YouTube is such a different experience now. I can’t believe these tiny speakers are so loud and clear.At this price, there’s no better value and with the processor/gpu power, you can use photo and video editing software with ease. It’s just so powerful. I recommend it to everyone, especially with the crystal clear FaceTime front camera.
"
380,B09G9HQHRH,5,"
Upgraded my Iphone SE 2020 for this. It's so powerful - great longer battery life and so much faster......By no means cheap, but it feels much more robust in the hand, has twice the storage capacity too at 128GB, and looks amazing. I'm not too fussed about the apparently great camera but I guess that will be nice too! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

381,B09G9HQHRH,5,"
Image and state of the art gadgets, phones etc have not been a priority in using technology, If it ain’t broken don’t fix it. Well my old phone was broken the screen was turning into a mosaic with shards of glass desperately trying to sneak through the screen cover. It was tired and worn out, so, tine for a new model. I have a sim only contract as I prefer to own my phone & upgrade it if & when I like. Time to venture into the land of Apple iPhones, I have had an iPad for a few years, love the speed of it compared to Android. The iPhone 13 has the same speed & qualities and I am really impressed with it. It is the only phone we use, no landline. The apps are quick to open, the camera is much better quality and the aesthetics are clean and streamlined. It has a bigger screen size than my old phone all the better for us oldies and having arthritis in my hands it is easier to grip the larger size. Transferring files, settings, apps etc was a doddle. Storage capacity much bigger than I am used to. All in all I am delighted with my new phone and hope to be using it for a long while to cone,

This is my first iPhone after years of Android use. iOS is quite different, but it works fine, once you wrap your head around it. The phone itself is excellent. Beautiful to look at and listen to, incidentally. Great camera, fairly lightweight and it feels well made. It definitely lives up to the hype. Clever too that if it’s close to my iPad or MacBook, I can make or receive calls on any of them. A few foibles. You can’t just start typing a name on the phone keypad to bring up a number, Android style, and it took me a while to realise you need to press and hold to move the cursor when you’re editing text like this review. But it’s minor stuff. If you can stomach the price (which was considerably discounted here - thanks, Amazon), then you won’t be disappointed.EDIT: I’ve found a way to speed up dialling my main contacts. You can use shortcuts to build a speed dial menu which you can access via an icon on your Home Screen. Thank-you, YouTube!

Can this phone make and receive a call? Yes. Like most phones it can. So why have I rated it so badly? First of all the Face ID is a terrible idea and nobody tells you that until you’ve got one. Face ID does not work in horizontal mode so you are forever having to grab the phone and hold it vertically to open the phone after it goes to sleep. It is so annoying. Befits you’d just reach across with your finger. To actually pick it up and look at the phone is nuts. Next. To operate the phone you are for ever trying to remember all the new slide combinations to access things that before were so easy to do. For instance Square crop on photos is no longer available unless you swipe up but only in a certain area. If I could I would throw this phone in the bin and go back to my 6s which was a far better phone. Don’t buy this phone. Apple are washed up. There era is over.

That's ever best phone i boutght. This is to fast, 5G works fine, its nice size and not weight. I have choosen the blue one with 128GB, i guess with the 5G and cloud storage its enought. So that's my opinion about.

I love the colour I got (starlight) and how amazing it is to have a 128gb instead of the pathetic 16gb I had before, I can now download all of my favourite apps and get my music back on, it’s a very good phone one of the best phones I had in a while. I always go for iPhones, it’s what I know, won’t go any other brand! I highly recommend this phone

The iPhone 13 has the same design as last year’s iPhone 12 model, but it's internally where the differences can be found.  One of the key internal changes being an improved camera where Apple have taken last year’s much praised iPhone 12 Pro Max wide camera lens and put it into the iPhone 13... and the images are fantastic!Another key improvement is Apples new A15 bionic chip with a 6 core CPU, 4 core GPU and 4Gb of RAM (in the iPhone 13).  Currently, the A15 Bionic chip is the fastest smartphone chip in the world meaning it can handle the most demanding apps/processes and still has room to spare.It also means Apple will continue to support the iPhone 13 with software (iOS) updates for 5 to 6 years, longer than any other smartphone manufacturer.  so if you are looking for a future proof, then that's what you will be doing by buying this.The battery is also very good.  I'm not a heavy phone user but I've become accustomed to ensuring I have a charger close by 'in case' I need it, whereas with the iPhone 13 I'm comfortably getting through the day without needing to charge it... and on a several occasions into the next day too.The main differences between the iPhone 13 and iPhone Pro, or Pro Max, are:- Graphics:  The iPhone 13 has a 4 core GPU where the Pro has a 5 core GPU- Display:  The iPhone 13 has a 60Hz refresh display where the Pro has ProMotion, an adaptive display which ranges from 10 to 120Hz depending on what you are looking at or doing- Battery:  The iPhone 13 has an estimated 15 hours of continuous streaming and the Pro as 20 hours- Camera:  The iPhone 13 has a Wide Camera lens and an Ultra-Wide camera lens, where the Pro has a Wide, Ultra-Wide and a Telephoto camera lens.The Pro models also have macro photography thanks to a new Ultra-Wide camera lens which take stunning images.Overall, the iPhone 13 is a fantastic phone and ideal for anyone wanting to:a) Upgrade from a phone older than the iPhone 11b) Looking for the most future proof smart phone they can getc) Are not fussed by telephoto or macro photographyLastly, I’ve attached 5 photo examples of Photographic Styles, new feature to the iPhone 13 range.

This review is for the Apple iPhone 13 (128GB) - Starlight.Another amazing phone from Apple. Lovely designed and works great. I upgraded from a iPhone 7+ and there is a world of difference in speed and features! Fantastic and worth every penny. Should keep me going for another 5 years!Update after using for a week: still love it! iOS 15 is great love the additions to the weather app and how you listen to your voicemails. 👍🏻👍🏻2 weeks update.. still going well! So much better than my iPhone 7+

Lovely phone beautiful made in a combined glass mineral and aluminium construction. Easy to use with a lot of thought that has gone into how this works embracing the very best of the latest technology. Very delighted with it. But, after setting it up on the day I received it, it started an update to IOS 15.4.1. The next day it was bricked! I tried hardware resets many times, updates through iTunes over and over and factory resets many many times. In the end I have had to send the phone off to Apple to be repaired. I still think this is a good phone though. And online Apple support is really good. But I can't help feeling disappointed that this can happen.As an update, Apple fixed this very quickly. Very impressed and a great phone! Added a well deserved star because of the superb product supported by a superb service.

Rivedo il mio primo giudizio. Dopo due anni dì pandemia il Face ID è decisamente superato. Meglio un bel Touch ID o un riconoscimento biometrico oculare, per esempio. Anche la tastiera va migliorata. È inaccettabile il continuo swap tra lettere e numeri.Primo commento: Non avrei mai pensato di innamorarmi di un cellulare 😅. È semplicemente perfetto, e il colore è fuori di testa! Spedizione impeccabile come sempre

Before we start, apologies for the long review, but I hope it's useful! This is a resubmission of my previous review, as for some reason it has disappeared from Amazon….So another year and another iPhone has launched. Now, I have to admit I didn't intend to buy this year, having had the 12 until now. However having my phone stolen, it had to be replaced.This years range is a mild revision over last year but that, in this case, is a good thing! So let’s break it down.Design:This years design borrows a lot from last years, and I think that’s a positive! Now, I know it’s subjective, but one of the things I like about the angular shaping of the 12 & 13 is that they feel less inclined to slip out of your hand. They feel well weighted, light but not excessively so and the anodised aluminium frame feels great in the hand. They also have the benefit of being more durable than previous models due to stronger glass, but it’s always suggested to use a screen protector.As a side note to the design, if you are looking at the 12 cases and wonder if they will fit, I’m afraid to say that they won’t. The camera hump is a slightly different size and has been moved on the back. Just something to be aware of before your new device comes.Performance:This is a area that I can’t say much about, but that’s not a negative. Apple devices, for better and worse, are always faster, smoother and more fluid than their android counterparts. I still have my first gen iPhone SE in the drawer, which I kept as a back up. It’s still snappy, quick and capable of keeping up with the pace of use, even today, so I expect this device to be no different. Scrolling and app opening/closing is buttery smooth, memory is more than adequate and overall it’s a good showing.Battery life:This is one of the areas where the 13 family really takes the lead above it’s previous iterations. Compared to my 12, I am getting at least 20% more screen on time per charge, which is very impressive. In addition, charging time appears to have dropped slightly over last years model, hitting 100% from zero about 10 percent faster than last year.Cameras:Once again, this is a small improvement, but considering the performance ability of the 12’s camera array, we are onto another winner. The main sensor now contains an improved optical image stabilisation system, which now stabilises the whole image sensor and not just the lens. This benefits the user greatly in night shots and if you’re a little shaky when holding the device. The wide angle lens is also a couple of degrees wider than last year. The image processor pulls out more image noise than the 12 too. A solid result.Warranty, support and repairs:One area that stands ahead of most is in the availability of support and repairs. All Apple stores have the ability to complete basic repairs in store, with more complicated ones done off site, can offer software support on site and can even arrange exchanges and replacements. If your phone develops a fault that’s covered under warranty, pop into store and they can sort it out. AppleCare takes this a step further. Say you crack your screen and you have AppleCare…..book a slot at your local store, pay a small excess of £29 (correct at time of writing) and they will replace your screen while you wait. If it can’t be repaired, a new device will be given to you. No other manufacturer offers this level of personal support without sending your phone off for repair, especially if you want it to be done by an official repair centre.Value and competition:I am not someone who buys one brand blindly, rather I choose to select each model by its own merits. Android or Apple, I’m open to all. However, at the 13’s price point, I think it’s far better than it’s main competition, which is the Samsung Galaxy S22. It has stronger battery life, better performance, a more premium build, less lenses but better image quality and overall just takes the crown for the middle to upper middle range for the year. I’m very impressed and hope to keep this one for a few years until something really opens my eyes or turns my head.So there’s a touch into the key areas of the iPhone 13. I hope this was useful to you. Take care and enjoy your summer!

Phone is as expected from an iPhone 13. Not much exciting given Apple aren’t really changing things.My frustration is with the exchange service.I submitted an exchange for my old iPhone X and stated the screen was cracked and was informed unless any other issue I would receive £50.I sent the phone in, it was then returned saying I wouldn’t receive the £50 as the screen was cracked.I have no issue with the reason, however do have issue that I communicated it was cracked and bought the new phone on the basis of an exchange.I’m now unable to exchange the phone elsewhere so effectively have lost £50 due to the lack of commitment.I suggest customers should submit pictures for this service to then commit to an exchange rather than wasting my timeVery poor customer service!

iPhones have a quality feel to them. This one is no different.  The screen is larger vs the phone size than my last iPhone (7) but this is due to the removal of the ‘thumb’ button.  I have to say I did prefer the fingerprint to the Face ID. And in the world of masks (which I still have to use at work) I don’t feel it’s as secure.  Battery life is much better, possibly just because it’s a new phone though.  Storage is also much better.  Other than that, if you’ve owned an iPhone it’s much the same.  If you’re an android person then you’ll probably hate it, else you’d have an iPhone already (and vice Versa!)

My previous phone was an iPhone X and when it finally ceased to work, I invested in an iPhone 13.  It’s only been a couple of weeks since my purchase but battery appears to last longer, camera is excellent !  The processor is faster and the phone is 5G.It’s early days but am very happy.

To tell you the truth I do miss my android phone and I would have gotten it rather than the iPhone. I simply chose this because of the price it was more affordable than the Samsung S22 ultra, and I couldn’t wait any longer. If you’re an iPhone lover which clearly I’m not you will enjoy this phone

The blue is truly beautiful and the square edges are great compared to the boring round version s one earlier phones.The operating system is archaic but Apple doesn’t care as it makes so much money. I knew about the cinematic effect on video on this but disregarded it as the usual marketing feature that people get sucked into. It It is anything but. The effect is superb and holding the phone is almost like having a gimbalQuality of detail on wide angle is appalling. It’s like a very heavily compressed jpg from the nineties. I was going to have a mini but obviously cannot compare as I didn’t buy both. Happy with this.
"
445,B09V43FPYG,5,"
I thought it would be more difficult to get used to the new phone and how it works but it was simple enough to adapt from my old iPhone.

Although like many ex android users I originally scorned and balked at the idea of paying hundreds of pounds for a phone, I  am now converted. There’s no going back once you’ve got used to the quality of an iPhone. The speed and ease of use is world class and Android can stick it where the sun shines, I’m staying with Apple.

It irritated me that my iPhone XS was not 5G. I decided to get an iPhone 13 and was glad I did. Not only is the battery life much improved, the display is clearer and brighter, but I get 5G!  The the price was not reduced (I bought it after the iPhone 14 was available) but the Amazon 12 months Interest Free helped soften (the price) shock!

An Android user since owning an HTC Hero in 2009, I’ve switched to an iPhone 13.I’d been very happy with a Samsung Galaxy S6 and then S8, both bought around a year after release at much reduced price. This time round, last year’s S21 was still pretty expensive and the reviews were disappointing. The new iPhone 13 got great reviews for its camera, reasonable reviews for battery life and it’s not too big (almost the same as my S8) so I switched!I’ve had it for 3 months and I’m very happy with it. It’s easy to use,very responsive and the camera is great. I especially like that I can access the camera with a single left swipe from the Lock Screen. Battery life is good so far, I’m a light user, so I can get two days of use between charges. Hopefully that’ll continue.

I decided after many years of Samsung I would try an iPhone again as I had a mac and know it integrates easier. The last iPhone I had was literally 10 years ago so was excited to see how they had progressed. Of course it is very impressive. The camera is amazing and the cinematic mode is mindblowing and of course it’s has loads of amazing features etc but it didn’t take long to start hitting walls where apps were concerned. Stuff that was easy and free and sometimes standard features on my Samsung either didn’t exist or you had to pay for it. Also some usability is not as user friendly as Samsung. I often felt when I was using my Samsung it was like using a laptop. You could browse between pages seamlessly and minimise apps and move between them too. But apple still haven’t been able to manage that. Lots of other stuff like this too. I will probably keep for a year just because I have committed to it now and it might grow on me. However it’s likely I will go back to a Samsung when I can

Only purchased after my Xs max was stolen, wanted to wait till iPhone 14 but having said that this version is a definite improvement over my previous model super slick better screen although slightly smaller (not being a max) battery lasts a couple of days between charges, I would say I’m a light to medium user I don’t use Facebook or the likes just a few what’s app messages Apple Music safari surfing & checking my share prices & call the wife on the way home.Have always used apple products for ease of use I have no problem being locked into their ecosystem & have no intention of moving to android.Would definitely recommend this model, just make sure you get a good case to protect it the screen repair prices are painful.

463,B09V43FPYG,4,"
As an Android user who didn’t have an iPhone since iPhone 4, I wanted to give it another go and the iOs is definitely a lot better now. Love the battery life on my iPhone 13. You can go a full day of heavy heavy use easily. One thing I don’t understand is that still to this date you cannot send pictures through bluetooth to another phone that is on Android… you will need to either send through Whatsapp (where you lose quality of the photo) or you will have to use and pay for a service such as Amazon Photos or google photos etc. Other than that it’s a really good phone but I hate those silly limitations such as the one above from Apple.

I decided to make the switch from Android as I was tempted by the excellent camera and premium brand/design.I was a little sad about forfeiting fingerprint ID, 120hz screen & excellent battery life but I need a great camera for work so on balance I went for it.I was disappointed I did. I can't believe a premium phone like this, costing double what my Android did, shipped with a faulty touch screen! It was as if I wasn't touching/tapping it and it was so bad I was intermittently unable to use the phone at all. I literally had to wait, put it down and come back to it, until it was willing to respond. I was okay with the downgrade the other features I mentioned but the touchscreen was kinda essential and therefore a deal-breaker!Thankfully Amazon are arranging a return & refund due the faulty touchscreen. Excellent service there.On the plus side, the photos I took while I had it were excellent as expected and the battery life was noticeably much better than previous iPhones I've used. The AMOLED screen was excellent.I can't comment on the accuracy of Face ID as I was wearing a mask most of the time and had to put my pin in whenever unlocking.If you're coming from an old iPhone you'll love it (if your coming from a nice Android you won't know the difference).
"
467,B09V43FPYG,4,"
I avoided previous iPhones due to how little they advance each time since iPhone 4.This one has flat edges which really improve the quality of the phone.
"
468,B09V43FPYG,3,"
They don't really tell you the Camera, while good, doesn't have optical zoom. This means any zooming is destructive and horrid. The pro is really the finished product. Thats what I should have got. If you don't take many photos, then it's fine. But nothing that much more special than an 11 or 12.

My note 8 samsung is almost 5 years old and needed a replacement. So went for the iphone 13.Similar priced android phones have a relatively poor battery life and not as impressive camera. There is no telephoto zoom but so far i havent missed it a lot.

I love it ones you have a iPhone it’s hard to replace it no regrets here , just the battery I thought that would keep longer , but if you’re watching videos all the time I guess that’s what happens you need to charge twice a day !

After my iphone x developed a fault so intermittent it could not be found to be fixed I waited to the release of the iphone 13 as it was only a month away I checked the prices of the iphone 12 and for just £50 extra the obvious winner was the 13 with the new battery capacity I can report battery life is huge and quite often I only use 25%of battery each day and that includes using GPS I honestly now never run low on battery none of that topping up during the day stuff After owning a 4s 5 6s and X this upgrade is the best

I really like the pastel pink and attention to detail  258GB. Very easy to set up feels more responsive than iPhone 12 and finally a sim tray from Apple where SIM card clicks in straight away I have struggled in the past with previous iPhones plus fab price on Amazon £100 cheaper than Apple

Upgraded from an ( iPhone 8 plus)This New iPhone 13 (product red) Looks and feels great!-(CAMERA) The camera quality is outstanding, And the ultra wide lense is an extra bonus when needing to take them Wide angle shots. There is a load of other features on the camera that have yet to be tested.-(Display) - The size is perfect being 6.1‑inch, Making gaming on my phone a possibility if i ever want to do that, It Also makes video viewing perfect, And with the display being almost the entire screen, it Keeps me focused on the video/application, The display is very responsive and just feels much cleaner that my previous 8+- No faults, I have yet to find an issue with this iPhone 13, If i do find myself finding issues with this phone, I'll be sure to edit this review.

Decent iPhone with good camera (excellent night time photos)Good battery life and charging time.Only criticism is you need to buy a plug for charging - penny pinching by apple considering the cost price hence the deduction of 1 star in overall rating.I purchased the Anker Nano USB C Plug for charging which works well.

Bought an open box deal as a Xmas gift for my daughter. Phone looked ok initially and everything seemed to work except no connection to mobile data so unable to make calls outside of Wi-Fi. Having wasted hours dealing with Amazon, the mobile phone carrier and Apple it transpires the handset has been recorded as lost/stolen so is useless and in effect a paperweight (Apple’s words!!!)I understand an open box deal to mean minor imperfections….not the handset I was sold.So I would be very wary of buying a phone this way as if it has been returned it makes you wonder why. This completely tarnished my daughters Xmas and does not reflect well on Amazon.

Love my new iPhone, been converted to Apple products since early 2000’s.  This phone is no different, easy to use, reliable and a great accessory.However, thought by now battery life would be much more improved and prices would be more affordable, expensive must have. Very happy with product though. 😁

Battery life is great 👍, it’s a nice red never had a red phone before, so easy to use and set up, I didn’t get the phone because of the camera I have a camera to take pictures but it’s good to have when you go out, but can’t do too much of that with COVID and the new variant, and it’s 5G I have 5G so thought I would get it, and it’s much lighter than my iPhone 11 so comfortable in my hand, very happy with my new phone

Box arrived opened with thin slice along of the one protective stickers. Don’t know why Amazon sends such products, but it clearly false advertising!UPDATE:Had long chat with Amazon, got to resolution with them and decided to try this one out.Phone itself, as well as cable seemed untouched. And phone is working well.So if not for opened box it would be good.As a result of resolution increasing to 3 stars. Kudos Amazon support.

Sheeple or advocate, I can’t help it, I like apple products. This is no different, an upgrade for my partners phone, an improved camera, almost a revision back to its earlier design, it’s a nice piece of kit.First time I’ve bought a handset from Amazon, having had a high value item go “AWOL” previously I was impressed by the pin delivery where you have to provide the driver with a code to allow them to handover.

I was forced to upgrade from an ageing iPhone 6s because the battery life had completely died, which I am convinced was almost entirely a function of software. Strange how after every update the battery performance deteriorated.The battery life is good. Pretty much everything else is a big step backwards. There is no fingerprint recognition anymore. It's Face ID. Doesn't work with a facemask which we have to wear these days. Doesn't work with my banking app.They got rid of the home button and have otherwise messed around with the OS. I struggle to access basic features now. You need to flick up or down at just the right place in just the right way rather than just pressing a button.They no longer bother to include a charger, so you need to buy that separately. They got rid of the headphone socket. So you can buy bulky bluetooth earbuds with limited battery life, or pay extra for an adapter, which is what I did.I bought an Apple silicone case. It slightly obstructs the lightning socket to the extent my charger cable won't fit. So every day I need to remove the case to charge it and then put it back on in the morning.On paper the specs are doubtless far superior to my 6s. But in practical terms, before they nixed my battery, the 6s did everything I needed with no fuss. This 13 has lost identifiable features: home button, headphone socket, charger, fingerprint scanner - with no compensation.How long before Apple decides I need to buy another phone and forces an OS update on me that nerfs my battery life?

Am I the only one having sound issues? As I’ve not seen other reviews about this. I usually have to put this on loudspeaker and even after I do, most people complain that they can’t hear me or that the sound is cutting out. Outside Amazon reviews, on Google there were some comments about this, so I’m entirely confused if this is particular to my device or others as well. Anyways I have to return it as there is absolutely no significant difference with the 13 from the 12, or 11 as well.

The phone was great and value for money not bad considering trade in value offered for my old iPhone. They rejected the trade-in saying the camera was not working, which is false. I have pictures taken the day before the  old phone was sent off. Beware of Amazon trade inoffers associated with trade ins. Iam receiving the old phone back and will keep as spare.Old phone received back today and camera works fine so they either did not check it or they had no intention of giving a trade in.

Okay I’ve had the phone for a few months now but there is this one scratch on the screen that has come from nowhere and even with apples “scratch resistant screen” it makes no difference. My iPhone 6 (phone before this 13) had scratches on the back but nothing on the screen. It’s really sad and you can’t see it but you know it’s there , then you look for it. Fine it. Then you are sad again

Arrived next day delivery, easy price plan by dd each month. Really pleased with purchase from this seller. The phone itself is fast, wish that Apple had stuck with touch ID though as if I wear makeup or have hair down it often won’t recognise me.Packaged sympathetically to reduce plastic, no charger just the charging usb cable. The box was also well packaged and product was undamaged, carefully delivered by person to person.

what an awful phone, since switching from an old Samsung A40 to an I phone 13 , I have had no end of problems, it rings out when it wants to , the other person might hear me but I hear nothing, it blocks websites even official uk org website so unable to access important services, it is not as accessible to switch from text , phone or email, I hate it , what a waste of money, will never get another, the list is so long it’s too much to list , give me a Samsung anyway , hassle , hassle, hassle.

Purchased this about a month ago . I've used android and Apple products before. Simple to set up, runs smoothly. Beautiful vibrant and bright display . I disabled Auto brightness and the display now goes up to 800 nits brightness in manual mode, much brighter than my previous pixel 6 phone ( I found the pixel 6 display a bit dim and lacking brightness, although a good phone) the iphone 13 also goes up to 1200 nits brightness during certain conditions. The camera is good, on a par with my previous pixel 6, video is even better ! It's quite user friendly, albeit not as easy to use as android, I guess it's just different, but easy to adapt to. It's a tad expensive, but I can feel a difference in quality, as in it feels and functions like a high quality device. It also seems fast and responsive! The 60hz display feels smooth, considering other devices have 120hz displays. Face unlock Is fast and has never failed. I would recommend this product!
"
567,B09V43FPYG,5,"
Enjoyed unboxing the phone and couldnt wait too see what the hype was all about. No scratches on the phone and came in perfect condition will definitely be buying one for my son in the near future thank you.

Had to send it back and get another one and the new one is just as terrible! So many faults, this is such a waste of money. The torch turns on whenever it pleases, the screen freezes and apps close in the middle of use. Time to move to android.

569,B09V43FPYG,5,"
Bought on the apple website during Black Friday sales.Battery life is brilliant - after 2 days of light use it was around 30%. Charges quite quickly. The screen is nice, and camera is great! This is my first time using an iPhone so still getting used to it, but it’s good so far.The Face ID is a bit weird to me, the phone lights up when you look at it but doesn’t always if you’ve not used it for a little while. I think I would probably still prefer finger print ID, but my friend swears by Face ID so I’m trying to get used to it.

Waste of space, would not connect via usb or cable to my two Imacs and I was unable to reset. A waste of money and time.Very frustrating and Amazon wanted me to contact Apple, not them, which I would not do, I wanted a phone that will work out of the box for this money.

Phone looks nice but is so often getting hot and loses signal which means that I have to turn the phone on and off to get signal back

The design reminds of I phone 4. The resolution is improved comparing to my iPhone 11 but feels more bulky in my palm than I phone 11. It arrived without a charger- ?!!!! Nearly 800 pounds for a new phone to buy additionally a charger - I don’t get it. And here comes the nightmare - the battery last a day if not less moderate use - absolutely disgraceful. I will definitely not recommend this product
"
575,B09V43FPYG,1,"
Amazon only offered a repair not a replacement. I have lost confidence in this mobile so I hope they don’t send the mobile back has I would like a brand new phone. Lost trust in that old phone only had this since end of November. Not used till 11 December problems with it since out of the box.
"
576,B09V43FPYG,1,"
The phone wouldn't set up or recognise my Apple ID so had to be returned.I bought insurance with it which is a mistake that requires a different conversation direct with Apple.as masssive pain in the A**S all round
"
577,B09V43FPYG,1,"
I would have liked to review the iPhone 13 but due to theft/fraud, there wasn’t one in the pare I received. This is a perfectly reasonable review, pointing out that not everything on Amazon is as expected, and the customer service to get my money back s utterly disgraceful.

This way a 60th birthday gift for my husband.  NO CONTRACT.Lovely looking phone. Easy to navigate once you get the hang of it. Fabulous functions.So much better than his android.Very slim so the purchase of an i phone 13 wallet case makes it easier to handle and protects it.Shame mobile companies exploit customers with high charges. Amazon were the best price out there even though still pricey . Well done amazon.

I bought this as my iPhone 7 stopped working and here are the reasons I bought a iPhone 13 over the pro and max.Apple ui looks so much better than android.You don’t need a better camera when it’s almost twice the price in the pro or max.120hz display isn’t worth the extra price.Smaller phone is better to hold and use than the max.128gb is enough storage for most people.ProsIt’s FastFast charging with 20w charger.Great UINice new camerasBigger screenCan connect external storage5GSmaller notchPicture in PictureSplit screen appsConsNo charger given to you.No Matt coloursNo telephotoNo 6x optical zoomNo night mode scanner4 not 5 GPUSmaller battery than the Pro maxNo Touch ID instead you have stupid Face IDNo promotion displayNo 3rd cameraNo pro resSoftware updates only last for 7 yearsBattery will need replacing after 3 yearsNo usb cAlthough I’ve listed the cons I think the iPhone is still the best phone that you can buy and you will use every day but I’d get the standard iPhone 13 because the max and pro are a rip off the price has become to high for very little extra features compared with the standard phone.And like all smart phones there’s nothing much new each year it’s just new software that improves the features so if you can wait another year buy the iPhone 14 which will possibly have the following.USB cTouch idNo notch screenBattery cameras

Recently i upgrade to iPhone 13 pro. I have been using this from 5 days. Battery is something I’m not really convinced with it. This is the first time I had this experience I bought a new product and the batter is not really up to the make. May be it’s because of the 5G. But it is bit disappointing, we can’t live in fear we have turn in dark mode, make changes in location, look for videos on YouTube how save battery. Camera quality, built quickly software easy to use iOS15. That’s my honest review about iPhone 13pro 256gb
"
588,B09V43FPYG,1,"
I bought this and had to return it,  main problem, I thought the camera was poor,  not as good as my 2 year old se model,  it struggled to focus on anything close up,  it is already partially zoomed at x1, so that does not help,the wide shot mode is utterly pointless, and make photos look strange,The photos often look false and over processed,I did a test with a photo group I am in,  I posted 2 identical photos, one with my old se model,And one with the iPhone 13,  I did not tell anyone what phones I had taken the photos with,I just asked them to say which was best,Not one person out of a big group, not one chose the I phone 13,Everyone said the iPhone se photo was better, sharper, more natural looking photo.So iPhone 13 is a very expensive downgrade in my opinion, and I was glad to see the back of it,I would not recommend this phone if like me, you use it more as a camera than a phone.It seems Apple have forgotten how to do a good upgrade,Considering how much this phone is,  If it was £400 it would be nearer the Mark, but over £700,It’s a expensive joke.
"
589,B09V43FPYG,5,"
Whilst it may be an incremental upgrade over the 12 three key areas have been substantially improved; storage, battery and camera. Face ID still the best. Perfect size - not a slab. It's the overall best phone with a sensibly-sized form factor. The negatives? In an era of 65W charging by the likes Of OnePlus the iPhone charges at a snail's pace - wirelessly it's ridiculously slow. 1200 Htz screen refresh only available on Pro models. Still no USB-C charging. Whilst smaller, the notch is beginning to look ridiculous. No fingerprint reader.

This not my 1st iPhone my last iPhone was 6s before I switch to android  “Samsung” in 2018.Now I switch back to iPhone as I missed iOS in past 3 years.Last time I had 64gb on the iPhone 6s that was not good for me as not much GB so, this time I those 512gb and it is my biggest GB I ever had on my iPhone 13!I love the color pink I never chose pink color before last time I had Space Grey on iPhone 6s I am guy so, why not. Pink color look amazing!The iOS software change in passed 3 year since iOS 11. iOS 15 is really good software I love it.The camera look fab can’t wait to record it for my YouTube Channel!For me I missed iPhone in passed 3 year.Overall Apple did the great jobs. 👍Can’t wait my next iPhone in 2023!

I was thinking of getting the Pro, but couldn’t justify the cost. I moved up from an iPhone X and love this model way better. The screen is so bright and colourful with excellent blacks. It films video in 4K Dolby Vision and is a must have phone for filming interviews or mini documentaries. Having two lenses is enough for me. I’ve blown the footage up and it has clarity as well as great audio, even in noisy environments. I work in media and can’t always carry a big camera around. This is great backup for those situations when my gear isn’t with me.I shot the attached photos in pitch black and was amazed at the results. Portrait photos are astonishing too. Just remember to keep the filter on normal (default). The others aren’t always reliable. You don’t need any post production either and the depth of field (background blur) is brilliant. At this rate there’ll be no need for cameras anymore in the future. Obviously a good camera is better right now, but the output of this iPhone is very usable.When watching movies, the image is sharp and vibrant with amazing sound. Watching movie trailers YouTube is such a different experience now. I can’t believe these tiny speakers are so loud and clear.At this price, there’s no better value and with the processor/gpu power, you can use photo and video editing software with ease. It’s just so powerful. I recommend it to everyone, especially with the crystal clear FaceTime front camera.

Upgraded my Iphone SE 2020 for this. It's so powerful - great longer battery life and so much faster......By no means cheap, but it feels much more robust in the hand, has twice the storage capacity too at 128GB, and looks amazing. I'm not too fussed about the apparently great camera but I guess that will be nice too! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Image and state of the art gadgets, phones etc have not been a priority in using technology, If it ain’t broken don’t fix it. Well my old phone was broken the screen was turning into a mosaic with shards of glass desperately trying to sneak through the screen cover. It was tired and worn out, so, tine for a new model. I have a sim only contract as I prefer to own my phone & upgrade it if & when I like. Time to venture into the land of Apple iPhones, I have had an iPad for a few years, love the speed of it compared to Android. The iPhone 13 has the same speed & qualities and I am really impressed with it. It is the only phone we use, no landline. The apps are quick to open, the camera is much better quality and the aesthetics are clean and streamlined. It has a bigger screen size than my old phone all the better for us oldies and having arthritis in my hands it is easier to grip the larger size. Transferring files, settings, apps etc was a doddle. Storage capacity much bigger than I am used to. All in all I am delighted with my new phone and hope to be using it for a long while to cone,

This is my first iPhone after years of Android use. iOS is quite different, but it works fine, once you wrap your head around it. The phone itself is excellent. Beautiful to look at and listen to, incidentally. Great camera, fairly lightweight and it feels well made. It definitely lives up to the hype. Clever too that if it’s close to my iPad or MacBook, I can make or receive calls on any of them. A few foibles. You can’t just start typing a name on the phone keypad to bring up a number, Android style, and it took me a while to realise you need to press and hold to move the cursor when you’re editing text like this review. But it’s minor stuff. If you can stomach the price (which was considerably discounted here - thanks, Amazon), then you won’t be disappointed.EDIT: I’ve found a way to speed up dialling my main contacts. You can use shortcuts to build a speed dial menu which you can access via an icon on your Home Screen. Thank-you, YouTube!

Purchased for my father for Xmas.  He could not believe he'd got a new iPhone after having an iPhone 6 forever.  It's classy and I'm told very easy to transfer data and contact details across from an old phone.  One happy dad!
"
598,B09V43FPYG,5,"
I brought this phone to upgrade from my iPhone 8 , I only needed 128 gig and didn’t need anymore, the pro and pro max didn’t interest me, this iPhone 13 does everything I need it to do, I would definitely recommend it
"
599,B09V43FPYG,5,"
Love this phone was an upgrade from my se (2020) so much of an improvement only thing to be aware of is you need a different charger plug to the older iPhones comes with cable but no plug

Bought the phone as a stop gap as I’d damaged my previous iPhone. Went for 128gb but quickly realised space would be an issue.Phone itself is brilliant, Apple have done a great job. I love the green colour!

Can this phone make and receive a call? Yes. Like most phones it can. So why have I rated it so badly? First of all the Face ID is a terrible idea and nobody tells you that until you’ve got one. Face ID does not work in horizontal mode so you are forever having to grab the phone and hold it vertically to open the phone after it goes to sleep. It is so annoying. Befits you’d just reach across with your finger. To actually pick it up and look at the phone is nuts. Next. To operate the phone you are for ever trying to remember all the new slide combinations to access things that before were so easy to do. For instance Square crop on photos is no longer available unless you swipe up but only in a certain area. If I could I would throw this phone in the bin and go back to my 6s which was a far better phone. Don’t buy this phone. Apple are washed up. There era is over.

606,B09V43FPYG,5,"
That's ever best phone i boutght. This is to fast, 5G works fine, its nice size and not weight. I have choosen the blue one with 128GB, i guess with the 5G and cloud storage its enought. So that's my opinion about.

I love the colour I got (starlight) and how amazing it is to have a 128gb instead of the pathetic 16gb I had before, I can now download all of my favourite apps and get my music back on, it’s a very good phone one of the best phones I had in a while. I always go for iPhones, it’s what I know, won’t go any other brand! I highly recommend this phone

The iPhone 13 has the same design as last year’s iPhone 12 model, but it's internally where the differences can be found.  One of the key internal changes being an improved camera where Apple have taken last year’s much praised iPhone 12 Pro Max wide camera lens and put it into the iPhone 13... and the images are fantastic!Another key improvement is Apples new A15 bionic chip with a 6 core CPU, 4 core GPU and 4Gb of RAM (in the iPhone 13).  Currently, the A15 Bionic chip is the fastest smartphone chip in the world meaning it can handle the most demanding apps/processes and still has room to spare.It also means Apple will continue to support the iPhone 13 with software (iOS) updates for 5 to 6 years, longer than any other smartphone manufacturer.  so if you are looking for a future proof, then that's what you will be doing by buying this.The battery is also very good.  I'm not a heavy phone user but I've become accustomed to ensuring I have a charger close by 'in case' I need it, whereas with the iPhone 13 I'm comfortably getting through the day without needing to charge it... and on a several occasions into the next day too.The main differences between the iPhone 13 and iPhone Pro, or Pro Max, are:- Graphics:  The iPhone 13 has a 4 core GPU where the Pro has a 5 core GPU- Display:  The iPhone 13 has a 60Hz refresh display where the Pro has ProMotion, an adaptive display which ranges from 10 to 120Hz depending on what you are looking at or doing- Battery:  The iPhone 13 has an estimated 15 hours of continuous streaming and the Pro as 20 hours- Camera:  The iPhone 13 has a Wide Camera lens and an Ultra-Wide camera lens, where the Pro has a Wide, Ultra-Wide and a Telephoto camera lens.The Pro models also have macro photography thanks to a new Ultra-Wide camera lens which take stunning images.Overall, the iPhone 13 is a fantastic phone and ideal for anyone wanting to:a) Upgrade from a phone older than the iPhone 11b) Looking for the most future proof smart phone they can getc) Are not fussed by telephoto or macro photographyLastly, I’ve attached 5 photo examples of Photographic Styles, new feature to the iPhone 13 range.

This review is for the Apple iPhone 13 (128GB) - Starlight.Another amazing phone from Apple. Lovely designed and works great. I upgraded from a iPhone 7+ and there is a world of difference in speed and features! Fantastic and worth every penny. Should keep me going for another 5 years!Update after using for a week: still love it! iOS 15 is great love the additions to the weather app and how you listen to your voicemails. 👍🏻👍🏻2 weeks update.. still going well! So much better than my iPhone 7+

Lovely phone beautiful made in a combined glass mineral and aluminium construction. Easy to use with a lot of thought that has gone into how this works embracing the very best of the latest technology. Very delighted with it. But, after setting it up on the day I received it, it started an update to IOS 15.4.1. The next day it was bricked! I tried hardware resets many times, updates through iTunes over and over and factory resets many many times. In the end I have had to send the phone off to Apple to be repaired. I still think this is a good phone though. And online Apple support is really good. But I can't help feeling disappointed that this can happen.As an update, Apple fixed this very quickly. Very impressed and a great phone! Added a well deserved star because of the superb product supported by a superb service.

Rivedo il mio primo giudizio. Dopo due anni dì pandemia il Face ID è decisamente superato. Meglio un bel Touch ID o un riconoscimento biometrico oculare, per esempio. Anche la tastiera va migliorata. È inaccettabile il continuo swap tra lettere e numeri.Primo commento: Non avrei mai pensato di innamorarmi di un cellulare 😅. È semplicemente perfetto, e il colore è fuori di testa! Spedizione impeccabile come sempre
"

I ordered a 256gb refurbished 13 pro. The trick is as you navigate through the colours or memory sizes, the refurbishment category keeps changing (excellent-good-fair) and you need to look one final time before placing an order!I got a phone in fair condition, which means dents and scratches which are visible. The side panel shows signs of damage as well.The battery health is 98% and phone is registered with Apple. All features work. So far I am able to get 4G only. So 5G is not tested.Finally, this seller must improve their packaging. When the phone arrived, it had lot of dew all over. A simple thing like a silica gel desiccant could have prevented this. After all, you pay a lot of money for an iPhone 13pro and expect the packaging not to damage it.
"
643,B09MGFQ684,5,"
At first, I was a little hesitant in buying this phone as it was refurbished/renewed, though I took the plunge and I'm so glad I it. This amazing iphone has 100% battery life, fantastic memory and when taking photos, wow.I orderd this on a Monday and was told that it would come on Friday. This iphone came on a Wednesday, so kudos to the seller as well.For something that was second hand, you wouldn't thnk it. This Is Definitely Like New and if you are looking for an upgrade then take the plunge like I did and get this fabtastic iphone
"
644,B09MGFQ684,4,"
A good seller who replies within 1 day.Phones are in quite good condition. Packaging can be improved. Price is very decent. The devices should be cleaned better before they get dispatched to the customers.I got 1 x iphone 13 pro max 256gb ""excellent"" condition which was excellent indeed. 94% battery but I had to spend some time cleaning the edges and cameras of the phone from dirt.I also ordered 1 x iphone 13 pro 256gb accidentally ""excellent condition"". This was not a real excellent since it came with lots of scratches on the screen. the battery life was 99% though.Overall, I recommend the seller since you're backed up by Amazon. He communicates well and he listens to his customers

645,B09MGFQ684,5,"
great seller, shipped the phone quickly and always responded quickly. The phone is in excellent condition, no scratches, like never used, 98% battery, I am satisfied

My first, comment was not good as they told me the phone would not be here till the 28, and would not give me a refund, but it was delivered on the 24th before Christmas so all great, phone was spot on and a thank you for getting it to me on the right date .

Got mine with 93% battery life and is impeccable. Had it for over a week and didn’t notice anything wrong performance wise - calls, video, speed.I really had to squint to notice any tiny scratches. I’m glad I made myself this gift instead of purchasing a more expensive one on a contract. It came with a new charging cable, so did feel a bit like getting a new phone apart (from the neutral packaging).Now I’m researching how to take better Xmas photos with the iphone13 Pro camera. :)

Happy with the delivery speed. I ordered 2 mobiles one 13 pro 512GB & other 1 TB. It arrived 1 day before committed arrival day. The delivery was in sellers box with Trustpilot rating. The parcel consist of mobile and a charging cable(no adapter). The mobile was perfectly packed in a thin transparent sheet. It looks exactly like brand new, no marks, scratches. The device works as expected. Got all useful apps installed successfully.The charging cable for 1 mobile seems faulty and I have contacted seller. Waiting for his revert. Apart from that am still not able to say about battery life. It’s first time my mobile is charged 100% since I got it and while writing this review.Overall happy with the product. I am expecting seller to send me a new charging cable. Will update my post on what seller has to say.

Wasn’t sure what to expect as I’ve never bought a renewed phone before but I have to say I’m impressed! Not a single scratch on the screen or body, battery health is 98% and it even came with a brand new genuine USB apple cable (rather than USB C which would have been annoying as I don’t have USB C plugs). I did notice the little speaker grill at the top of the screen is dirty and needs a clean but apart from that the phone is like new!
"
662,B09MGFQ684,3,"
I have just received an iphone 13 Pro. The phone externally looks in great condition but the battery charge is only 16%. It said that it had to be at least 80% when arriving so I hope this is not a problem with the battery.

Although it arrived in a plain cardboard box, this was essentially a new phone, with no marks, scratches or signs of any wear and tear.Upon registering the phone with Apple it came up that the warranty had started in July - so clearly it had been switched on and registered at some point - but otherwise 100% mint conditionWould definitely recommended, as effectively it's saving you £100s on a new phone direct from Amazon or Apple, but maybe just keep an eye on the warranty start/end date - this one was only a couple of months off the full 12, but clearly this may not always be the case...

I have used mazuma many times before and had good service. This time, felt very confident buying an expensive but refurbished phone as it was through Amazon via mazuma. I didn’t start using it for 2 weeks but when I did, over the Christmas period it was clearly faulty. The speaker function failed the microphone didn’t work and it constantly turned off on the middle of calls. The seller agreed a return and has now refused a refund saying it works. I am shocked at the appalling customer service. Never again. Straight to apple next time

The phone came in musicMagpie box, very protected. They said it will arrive approximately between Aug 1 - 4, but it came few days before - the morning after I ordered it.

I chose MusicMagpie mainly because of their amazing consistency & good reviews with such a high volume of sales. That was truly inspiring. From the quality of what I received, I’m very pleased. I would have described it as ‘excellent’. As far as the usability of the phone, brilliantly easy when you’ve had 5 previous iPhones. My only slight disappointment was the battery only has 87% remaining. I can’t grumble really as it was only sold as more than 80%.
"
696,B09MGFQ684,5,"

At first i was unsure as the guaranteed minimum 80% max battery capacity was too low, I was happy to find it at 100% the phone had no scratches or blemishes or dents or any faults. There was some dust on the phone but that was fixed with a quick wipe. Another thing is that the charger cable was not lightning to usb c but usb a to lightning, not a problem just inconvenient as it is less inefficient than the actual charger you get.If you are on the fence of buying this phone like i was get it because it was an absolute steal for 800 very happy with my purchase.

Love this iPhone I have found the battery life good I have also found the sound excellent when on the phone and listening to music and books however I am disappointed that I cannot get the Kindle app to work not the fault of the phone but Amazon who need to rectify this

Before we start, apologies for the long review, but I hope it's useful! This is a resubmission of my previous review, as for some reason it has disappeared from Amazon….So another year and another iPhone has launched. Now, I have to admit I didn't intend to buy this year, having had the 12 until now. However having my phone stolen, it had to be replaced.This years range is a mild revision over last year but that, in this case, is a good thing! So let’s break it down.Design:This years design borrows a lot from last years, and I think that’s a positive! Now, I know it’s subjective, but one of the things I like about the angular shaping of the 12 & 13 is that they feel less inclined to slip out of your hand. They feel well weighted, light but not excessively so and the anodised aluminium frame feels great in the hand. They also have the benefit of being more durable than previous models due to stronger glass, but it’s always suggested to use a screen protector.As a side note to the design, if you are looking at the 12 cases and wonder if they will fit, I’m afraid to say that they won’t. The camera hump is a slightly different size and has been moved on the back. Just something to be aware of before your new device comes.Performance:This is a area that I can’t say much about, but that’s not a negative. Apple devices, for better and worse, are always faster, smoother and more fluid than their android counterparts. I still have my first gen iPhone SE in the drawer, which I kept as a back up. It’s still snappy, quick and capable of keeping up with the pace of use, even today, so I expect this device to be no different. Scrolling and app opening/closing is buttery smooth, memory is more than adequate and overall it’s a good showing.Battery life:This is one of the areas where the 13 family really takes the lead above it’s previous iterations. Compared to my 12, I am getting at least 20% more screen on time per charge, which is very impressive. In addition, charging time appears to have dropped slightly over last years model, hitting 100% from zero about 10 percent faster than last year.Cameras:Once again, this is a small improvement, but considering the performance ability of the 12’s camera array, we are onto another winner. The main sensor now contains an improved optical image stabilisation system, which now stabilises the whole image sensor and not just the lens. This benefits the user greatly in night shots and if you’re a little shaky when holding the device. The wide angle lens is also a couple of degrees wider than last year. The image processor pulls out more image noise than the 12 too. A solid result.Warranty, support and repairs:One area that stands ahead of most is in the availability of support and repairs. All Apple stores have the ability to complete basic repairs in store, with more complicated ones done off site, can offer software support on site and can even arrange exchanges and replacements. If your phone develops a fault that’s covered under warranty, pop into store and they can sort it out. AppleCare takes this a step further. Say you crack your screen and you have AppleCare…..book a slot at your local store, pay a small excess of £29 (correct at time of writing) and they will replace your screen while you wait. If it can’t be repaired, a new device will be given to you. No other manufacturer offers this level of personal support without sending your phone off for repair, especially if you want it to be done by an official repair centre.Value and competition:I am not someone who buys one brand blindly, rather I choose to select each model by its own merits. Android or Apple, I’m open to all. However, at the 13’s price point, I think it’s far better than it’s main competition, which is the Samsung Galaxy S22. It has stronger battery life, better performance, a more premium build, less lenses but better image quality and overall just takes the crown for the middle to upper middle range for the year. I’m very impressed and hope to keep this one for a few years until something really opens my eyes or turns my head.So there’s a touch into the key areas of the iPhone 13. I hope this was useful to you. Take care and enjoy your summer!

Phone is as expected from an iPhone 13. Not much exciting given Apple aren’t really changing things.My frustration is with the exchange service.I submitted an exchange for my old iPhone X and stated the screen was cracked and was informed unless any other issue I would receive £50.I sent the phone in, it was then returned saying I wouldn’t receive the £50 as the screen was cracked.I have no issue with the reason, however do have issue that I communicated it was cracked and bought the new phone on the basis of an exchange.I’m now unable to exchange the phone elsewhere so effectively have lost £50 due to the lack of commitment.I suggest customers should submit pictures for this service to then commit to an exchange rather than wasting my timeVery poor customer service!

iPhones have a quality feel to them. This one is no different.  The screen is larger vs the phone size than my last iPhone (7) but this is due to the removal of the ‘thumb’ button.  I have to say I did prefer the fingerprint to the Face ID. And in the world of masks (which I still have to use at work) I don’t feel it’s as secure.  Battery life is much better, possibly just because it’s a new phone though.  Storage is also much better.  Other than that, if you’ve owned an iPhone it’s much the same.  If you’re an android person then you’ll probably hate it, else you’d have an iPhone already (and vice Versa!)

My previous phone was an iPhone X and when it finally ceased to work, I invested in an iPhone 13.  It’s only been a couple of weeks since my purchase but battery appears to last longer, camera is excellent !  The processor is faster and the phone is 5G.It’s early days but am very happy.

To tell you the truth I do miss my android phone and I would have gotten it rather than the iPhone. I simply chose this because of the price it was more affordable than the Samsung S22 ultra, and I couldn’t wait any longer. If you’re an iPhone lover which clearly I’m not you will enjoy this phone

The blue is truly beautiful and the square edges are great compared to the boring round version s one earlier phones.The operating system is archaic but Apple doesn’t care as it makes so much money. I knew about the cinematic effect on video on this but disregarded it as the usual marketing feature that people get sucked into. It It is anything but. The effect is superb and holding the phone is almost like having a gimbalQuality of detail on wide angle is appalling. It’s like a very heavily compressed jpg from the nineties. I was going to have a mini but obviously cannot compare as I didn’t buy both. Happy with this.
"

I thought it would be more difficult to get used to the new phone and how it works but it was simple enough to adapt from my old iPhone.

Although like many ex android users I originally scorned and balked at the idea of paying hundreds of pounds for a phone, I  am now converted. There’s no going back once you’ve got used to the quality of an iPhone. The speed and ease of use is world class and Android can stick it where the sun shines, I’m staying with Apple.

It irritated me that my iPhone XS was not 5G. I decided to get an iPhone 13 and was glad I did. Not only is the battery life much improved, the display is clearer and brighter, but I get 5G!  The the price was not reduced (I bought it after the iPhone 14 was available) but the Amazon 12 months Interest Free helped soften (the price) shock!

It’s an iPhone it’s the same as every phone, if you complain that of this then don’t upgrade every single year… it’s that simple.Last phone was the XR there are loads of amazing changes between both phone. Battery life is excellent.

An Android user since owning an HTC Hero in 2009, I’ve switched to an iPhone 13.I’d been very happy with a Samsung Galaxy S6 and then S8, both bought around a year after release at much reduced price. This time round, last year’s S21 was still pretty expensive and the reviews were disappointing. The new iPhone 13 got great reviews for its camera, reasonable reviews for battery life and it’s not too big (almost the same as my S8) so I switched!I’ve had it for 3 months and I’m very happy with it. It’s easy to use,very responsive and the camera is great. I especially like that I can access the camera with a single left swipe from the Lock Screen. Battery life is good so far, I’m a light user, so I can get two days of use between charges. Hopefully that’ll continue.

I decided after many years of Samsung I would try an iPhone again as I had a mac and know it integrates easier. The last iPhone I had was literally 10 years ago so was excited to see how they had progressed. Of course it is very impressive. The camera is amazing and the cinematic mode is mindblowing and of course it’s has loads of amazing features etc but it didn’t take long to start hitting walls where apps were concerned. Stuff that was easy and free and sometimes standard features on my Samsung either didn’t exist or you had to pay for it. Also some usability is not as user friendly as Samsung. I often felt when I was using my Samsung it was like using a laptop. You could browse between pages seamlessly and minimise apps and move between them too. But apple still haven’t been able to manage that. Lots of other stuff like this too. I will probably keep for a year just because I have committed to it now and it might grow on me. However it’s likely I will go back to a Samsung when I can

Only purchased after my Xs max was stolen, wanted to wait till iPhone 14 but having said that this version is a definite improvement over my previous model super slick better screen although slightly smaller (not being a max) battery lasts a couple of days between charges, I would say I’m a light to medium user I don’t use Facebook or the likes just a few what’s app messages Apple Music safari surfing & checking my share prices & call the wife on the way home.Have always used apple products for ease of use I have no problem being locked into their ecosystem & have no intention of moving to android.Would definitely recommend this model, just make sure you get a good case to protect it the screen repair prices are painful.

737,B09G9FB7LV,4,"
As an Android user who didn’t have an iPhone since iPhone 4, I wanted to give it another go and the iOs is definitely a lot better now. Love the battery life on my iPhone 13. You can go a full day of heavy heavy use easily. One thing I don’t understand is that still to this date you cannot send pictures through bluetooth to another phone that is on Android… you will need to either send through Whatsapp (where you lose quality of the photo) or you will have to use and pay for a service such as Amazon Photos or google photos etc. Other than that it’s a really good phone but I hate those silly limitations such as the one above from Apple.

I decided to make the switch from Android as I was tempted by the excellent camera and premium brand/design.I was a little sad about forfeiting fingerprint ID, 120hz screen & excellent battery life but I need a great camera for work so on balance I went for it.I was disappointed I did. I can't believe a premium phone like this, costing double what my Android did, shipped with a faulty touch screen! It was as if I wasn't touching/tapping it and it was so bad I was intermittently unable to use the phone at all. I literally had to wait, put it down and come back to it, until it was willing to respond. I was okay with the downgrade the other features I mentioned but the touchscreen was kinda essential and therefore a deal-breaker!Thankfully Amazon are arranging a return & refund due the faulty touchscreen. Excellent service there.On the plus side, the photos I took while I had it were excellent as expected and the battery life was noticeably much better than previous iPhones I've used. The AMOLED screen was excellent.I can't comment on the accuracy of Face ID as I was wearing a mask most of the time and had to put my pin in whenever unlocking.If you're coming from an old iPhone you'll love it (if your coming from a nice Android you won't know the difference).
"
741,B09G9FB7LV,4,"
I avoided previous iPhones due to how little they advance each time since iPhone 4.This one has flat edges which really improve the quality of the phone.
"
742,B09G9FB7LV,3,"
They don't really tell you the Camera, while good, doesn't have optical zoom. This means any zooming is destructive and horrid. The pro is really the finished product. Thats what I should have got. If you don't take many photos, then it's fine. But nothing that much more special than an 11 or 12.
"
743,B09G9FB7LV,5,"
Excellent product from Apple but, in my opinion, a little overpriced.  Bought for my wife's birthday and that is what she wanted but I have Samsung.  They are cheaper and just as good.

My note 8 samsung is almost 5 years old and needed a replacement. So went for the iphone 13.Similar priced android phones have a relatively poor battery life and not as impressive camera. There is no telephoto zoom but so far i havent missed it a lot. I like android but have to say im getting fewer malware on ios ( this is my first iphone btw).The camera is stunning.Hope this phone will last another 5 /6 years.

I love it ones you have a iPhone it’s hard to replace it no regrets here , just the battery I thought that would keep longer , but if you’re watching videos all the time I guess that’s what happens you need to charge twice a day !
"
749,B09G9FB7LV,3,"
Lovely to look at - and Apple user yet I prefer the central finger control. Often pressing screen over and over, rather than once.  Unclear how Apple justify the price.  Come on Apple - if you’re going to upgrade models do it well.

After my iphone x developed a fault so intermittent it could not be found to be fixed I waited to the release of the iphone 13 as it was only a month away I checked the prices of the iphone 12 and for just £50 extra the obvious winner was the 13 with the new battery capacity I can report battery life is huge and quite often I only use 25%of battery each day and that includes using GPS I honestly now never run low on battery none of that topping up during the day stuff After owning a 4s 5 6s and X this upgrade is the best

Upgraded from an ( iPhone 8 plus)This New iPhone 13 (product red) Looks and feels great!-(CAMERA) The camera quality is outstanding, And the ultra wide lense is an extra bonus when needing to take them Wide angle shots. There is a load of other features on the camera that have yet to be tested.-(Display) - The size is perfect being 6.1‑inch, Making gaming on my phone a possibility if i ever want to do that, It Also makes video viewing perfect, And with the display being almost the entire screen, it Keeps me focused on the video/application, The display is very responsive and just feels much cleaner that my previous 8+- No faults, I have yet to find an issue with this iPhone 13, If i do find myself finding issues with this phone, I'll be sure to edit this review.

760,B09G9FB7LV,4,"
Decent iPhone with good camera (excellent night time photos)Good battery life and charging time.Only criticism is you need to buy a plug for charging - penny pinching by apple considering the cost price hence the deduction of 1 star in overall rating.I purchased the Anker Nano USB C Plug for charging which works well.

Bought an open box deal as a Xmas gift for my daughter. Phone looked ok initially and everything seemed to work except no connection to mobile data so unable to make calls outside of Wi-Fi. Having wasted hours dealing with Amazon, the mobile phone carrier and Apple it transpires the handset has been recorded as lost/stolen so is useless and in effect a paperweight (Apple’s words!!!)I understand an open box deal to mean minor imperfections….not the handset I was sold.So I would be very wary of buying a phone this way as if it has been returned it makes you wonder why. This completely tarnished my daughters Xmas and does not reflect well on Amazon.

I was forced to upgrade from an ageing iPhone 6s because the battery life had completely died, which I am convinced was almost entirely a function of software. Strange how after every update the battery performance deteriorated.The battery life is good. Pretty much everything else is a big step backwards. There is no fingerprint recognition anymore. It's Face ID. Doesn't work with a facemask which we have to wear these days. Doesn't work with my banking app.They got rid of the home button and have otherwise messed around with the OS. I struggle to access basic features now. You need to flick up or down at just the right place in just the right way rather than just pressing a button.They no longer bother to include a charger, so you need to buy that separately. They got rid of the headphone socket. So you can buy bulky bluetooth earbuds with limited battery life, or pay extra for an adapter, which is what I did.I bought an Apple silicone case. It slightly obstructs the lightning socket to the extent my charger cable won't fit. So every day I need to remove the case to charge it and then put it back on in the morning.On paper the specs are doubtless far superior to my 6s. But in practical terms, before they nixed my battery, the 6s did everything I needed with no fuss. This 13 has lost identifiable features: home button, headphone socket, charger, fingerprint scanner - with no compensation.How long before Apple decides I need to buy another phone and forces an OS update on me that nerfs my battery life?

Am I the only one having sound issues? As I’ve not seen other reviews about this. I usually have to put this on loudspeaker and even after I do, most people complain that they can’t hear me or that the sound is cutting out. Outside Amazon reviews, on Google there were some comments about this, so I’m entirely confused if this is particular to my device or others as well. Anyways I have to return it as there is absolutely no significant difference with the 13 from the 12, or 11 as well.

Having been with android for awhile I decided to go back to Apple and I’m not disappointed wish I’d of gone back sooner

The phone was great and value for money not bad considering trade in value offered for my old iPhone. They rejected the trade-in saying the camera was not working, which is false. I have pictures taken the day before the  old phone was sent off. Beware of Amazon trade inoffers associated with trade ins. Iam receiving the old phone back and will keep as spare.Old phone received back today and camera works fine so they either did not check it or they had no intention of giving a trade in.

Okay I’ve had the phone for a few months now but there is this one scratch on the screen that has come from nowhere and even with apples “scratch resistant screen” it makes no difference. My iPhone 6 (phone before this 13) had scratches on the back but nothing on the screen. It’s really sad and you can’t see it but you know it’s there , then you look for it. Fine it. Then you are sad again

Arrived next day delivery, easy price plan by dd each month. Really pleased with purchase from this seller. The phone itself is fast, wish that Apple had stuck with touch ID though as if I wear makeup or have hair down it often won’t recognise me.Packaged sympathetically to reduce plastic, no charger just the charging usb cable. The box was also well packaged and product was undamaged, carefully delivered by person to person.

This is my 5th iPhone (13) and to be honest I wouldn’t buy anything else, yes a little expensive but the IOS system is so intuitive and links seamlessly with all my other Apple devices. Still the best Mobile Phone around.

Virtually without a flaw.
"
797,B09G9FB7LV,3,"
Be warned you’ll need to purchase a specific plug to charge this phone all because they won’t put a usb on one end of the charge cable ridiculous after such a high cost for phone already “greedy apple corporation” at it again if replacing my own phone ill be checking out competitors for value

It is super hot, the battery only can last 4 hours. Compared to my old 4 years old iphone8 which still can last 6 hours for daily use, completely can not acceptable. Need to return it.

I sent the item back the day after I received it as it was a lot smaller than expected.I packaged it and sent it back 1st class, Amazon have received the item but are requesting 14 working days to issue a refund. 14 working days for a refund is ridiculous. I would recommend never buying a high valued item from Amazon.

what an awful phone, since switching from an old Samsung A40 to an I phone 13 , I have had no end of problems, it rings out when it wants to , the other person might hear me but I hear nothing, it blocks websites even official uk org website so unable to access important services, it is not as accessible to switch from text , phone or email, I hate it , what a waste of money, will never get another, the list is so long it’s too much to list , give me a Samsung anyway , hassle , hassle, hassle.

Purchased this about a month ago . I've used android and Apple products before. Simple to set up, runs smoothly. Beautiful vibrant and bright display . I disabled Auto brightness and the display now goes up to 800 nits brightness in manual mode, much brighter than my previous pixel 6 phone ( I found the pixel 6 display a bit dim and lacking brightness, although a good phone) the iphone 13 also goes up to 1200 nits brightness during certain conditions. The camera is good, on a par with my previous pixel 6, video is even better ! It's quite user friendly, albeit not as easy to use as android, I guess it's just different, but easy to adapt to. It's a tad expensive, but I can feel a difference in quality, as in it feels and functions like a high quality device. It also seems fast and responsive! The 60hz display feels smooth, considering other devices have 120hz displays. Face unlock Is fast and has never failed. I would recommend this product!
"
841,B09G9FB7LV,5,"
Enjoyed unboxing the phone and couldnt wait too see what the hype was all about. No scratches on the phone and came in perfect condition will definitely be buying one for my son in the near future thank you.
"
842,B09G9FB7LV,1,"
Had to send it back and get another one and the new one is just as terrible! So many faults, this is such a waste of money. The torch turns on whenever it pleases, the screen freezes and apps close in the middle of use. Time to move to android.
"
843,B09G9FB7LV,5,"
Bought on the apple website during Black Friday sales.Battery life is brilliant - after 2 days of light use it was around 30%. Charges quite quickly. The screen is nice, and camera is great! This is my first time using an iPhone so still getting used to it, but it’s good so far.The Face ID is a bit weird to me, the phone lights up when you look at it but doesn’t always if you’ve not used it for a little while. I think I would probably still prefer finger print ID, but my friend swears by Face ID so I’m trying to get used to it.
"
844,B09G9FB7LV,1,"
Had to change plans and returned phone by post to Dunfermline
"
845,B09G9FB7LV,1,"
Had phone 1 week and screen broke out of no where
"
846,B09G9FB7LV,1,"
Waste of space, would not connect via usb or cable to my two Imacs and I was unable to reset. A waste of money and time.Very frustrating and Amazon wanted me to contact Apple, not them, which I would not do, I wanted a phone that will work out of the box for this money.
"
847,B09G9FB7LV,1,"
Phone looks nice but is so often getting hot and loses signal which means that I have to turn the phone on and off to get signal back
"
848,B09G9FB7LV,1,"
The design reminds of I phone 4. The resolution is improved comparing to my iPhone 11 but feels more bulky in my palm than I phone 11. It arrived without a charger- ?!!!! Nearly 800 pounds for a new phone to buy additionally a charger - I don’t get it. And here comes the nightmare - the battery last a day if not less moderate use - absolutely disgraceful. I will definitely not recommend this product
"
849,B09G9FB7LV,1,"
Amazon only offered a repair not a replacement. I have lost confidence in this mobile so I hope they don’t send the mobile back has I would like a brand new phone. Lost trust in that old phone only had this since end of November. Not used till 11 December problems with it since out of the box.
"
850,B09G9FB7LV,1,"
The phone wouldn't set up or recognise my Apple ID so had to be returned.I bought insurance with it which is a mistake that requires a different conversation direct with Apple.as masssive pain in the A**S all round
"
851,B09G9FB7LV,1,"
I would have liked to review the iPhone 13 but due to theft/fraud, there wasn’t one in the pare I received. This is a perfectly reasonable review, pointing out that not everything on Amazon is as expected, and the customer service to get my money back s utterly disgraceful.
"
852,B09G9FB7LV,1,"
Overall this would be a good phone if it wasn’t for the fact that the call quality is terrible.If I could return this I would. I would not recommend you buy it.
"
853,B09G9FB7LV,1,"
Ended up returning it - I’ve literally nothing more to say other than it's a small upgrade over iPhone 11, and an even smaller one over iPhone 12.Not worth the money at all. Apple need to up their game.

Hi, recently got an iPhone 13,upgrade from 3 Ireland,not Amazon. Long time Android user,so still getting used to iOS ,no complaints,working just fine,fast system & response to touch & gestures,face recognition I find to be remarkable,& was very easy to configure to my likings & set up from my old android. I'm quite happy & satisfied with it,will revisit this in a few weeks time with an update.
"
857,B09G9FB7LV,5,"
This way a 60th birthday gift for my husband.  NO CONTRACT.Lovely looking phone. Easy to navigate once you get the hang of it. Fabulous functions.So much better than his android.Very slim so the purchase of an i phone 13 wallet case makes it easier to handle and protects it.Shame mobile companies exploit customers with high charges. Amazon were the best price out there even though still pricey . Well done amazon.
"
858,B09G9FB7LV,5,"
Bought directly from Apple store, but really loving it. Fast, light, easy to handle, strongly recommend.

859,B09G9FB7LV,4,"
I bought this as my iPhone 7 stopped working and here are the reasons I bought a iPhone 13 over the pro and max.Apple ui looks so much better than android.You don’t need a better camera when it’s almost twice the price in the pro or max.120hz display isn’t worth the extra price.Smaller phone is better to hold and use than the max.128gb is enough storage for most people.ProsIt’s FastFast charging with 20w charger.Great UINice new camerasBigger screenCan connect external storage5GSmaller notchPicture in PictureSplit screen appsConsNo charger given to you.No Matt coloursNo telephotoNo 6x optical zoomNo night mode scanner4 not 5 GPUSmaller battery than the Pro maxNo Touch ID instead you have stupid Face IDNo promotion displayNo 3rd cameraNo pro resSoftware updates only last for 7 yearsBattery will need replacing after 3 yearsNo usb cAlthough I’ve listed the cons I think the iPhone is still the best phone that you can buy and you will use every day but I’d get the standard iPhone 13 because the max and pro are a rip off the price has become to high for very little extra features compared with the standard phone.And like all smart phones there’s nothing much new each year it’s just new software that improves the features so if you can wait another year buy the iPhone 14 which will possibly have the following.USB cTouch idNo notch screenBattery cameras

Recently i upgrade to iPhone 13 pro. I have been using this from 5 days. Battery is something I’m not really convinced with it. This is the first time I had this experience I bought a new product and the batter is not really up to the make. May be it’s because of the 5G. But it is bit disappointing, we can’t live in fear we have turn in dark mode, make changes in location, look for videos on YouTube how save battery. Camera quality, built quickly software easy to use iOS15. That’s my honest review about iPhone 13pro 256gb
"
862,B09G9FB7LV,1,"
I bought this and had to return it,  main problem, I thought the camera was poor,  not as good as my 2 year old se model,  it struggled to focus on anything close up,  it is already partially zoomed at x1, so that does not help,the wide shot mode is utterly pointless, and make photos look strange,The photos often look false and over processed,I did a test with a photo group I am in,  I posted 2 identical photos, one with my old se model,And one with the iPhone 13,  I did not tell anyone what phones I had taken the photos with,I just asked them to say which was best,Not one person out of a big group, not one chose the I phone 13,Everyone said the iPhone se photo was better, sharper, more natural looking photo.So iPhone 13 is a very expensive downgrade in my opinion, and I was glad to see the back of it,I would not recommend this phone if like me, you use it more as a camera than a phone.It seems Apple have forgotten how to do a good upgrade,Considering how much this phone is,  If it was £400 it would be nearer the Mark, but over £700,It’s a expensive joke.
"
863,B09G9FB7LV,5,"
Whilst it may be an incremental upgrade over the 12 three key areas have been substantially improved; storage, battery and camera. Face ID still the best. Perfect size - not a slab. It's the overall best phone with a sensibly-sized form factor. The negatives? In an era of 65W charging by the likes Of OnePlus the iPhone charges at a snail's pace - wirelessly it's ridiculously slow. 1200 Htz screen refresh only available on Pro models. Still no USB-C charging. Whilst smaller, the notch is beginning to look ridiculous. No fingerprint reader.

This not my 1st iPhone my last iPhone was 6s before I switch to android  “Samsung” in 2018.Now I switch back to iPhone as I missed iOS in past 3 years.Last time I had 64gb on the iPhone 6s that was not good for me as not much GB so, this time I those 512gb and it is my biggest GB I ever had on my iPhone 13!I love the color pink I never chose pink color before last time I had Space Grey on iPhone 6s I am guy so, why not. Pink color look amazing!The iOS software change in passed 3 year since iOS 11. iOS 15 is really good software I love it.The camera look fab can’t wait to record it for my YouTube Channel!For me I missed iPhone in passed 3 year.Overall Apple did the great jobs. 👍Can’t wait my next iPhone in 2023!
"
865,B09G9FB7LV,1,"
While the phone arrived unlocked and in good condition, my SIM wasn’t working. I contacted my network who advised that the phone had been blacklisted as it had previously been reported as stolen by its original owner. Phone therefore couldn’t be used and had to be returned.

866,B09G9FB7LV,1,"
This product is used - didn’t say a lot If it is used or not .

I was thinking of getting the Pro, but couldn’t justify the cost. I moved up from an iPhone X and love this model way better. The screen is so bright and colourful with excellent blacks. It films video in 4K Dolby Vision and is a must have phone for filming interviews or mini documentaries. Having two lenses is enough for me. I’ve blown the footage up and it has clarity as well as great audio, even in noisy environments. I work in media and can’t always carry a big camera around. This is great backup for those situations when my gear isn’t with me.I shot the attached photos in pitch black and was amazed at the results. Portrait photos are astonishing too. Just remember to keep the filter on normal (default). The others aren’t always reliable. You don’t need any post production either and the depth of field (background blur) is brilliant. At this rate there’ll be no need for cameras anymore in the future. Obviously a good camera is better right now, but the output of this iPhone is very usable.When watching movies, the image is sharp and vibrant with amazing sound. Watching movie trailers YouTube is such a different experience now. I can’t believe these tiny speakers are so loud and clear.At this price, there’s no better value and with the processor/gpu power, you can use photo and video editing software with ease. It’s just so powerful. I recommend it to everyone, especially with the crystal clear FaceTime front camera.
"
868,B09G9FB7LV,5,"
Upgraded my Iphone SE 2020 for this. It's so powerful - great longer battery life and so much faster......By no means cheap, but it feels much more robust in the hand, has twice the storage capacity too at 128GB, and looks amazing. I'm not too fussed about the apparently great camera but I guess that will be nice too! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
"
869,B09G9FB7LV,5,"
Image and state of the art gadgets, phones etc have not been a priority in using technology, If it ain’t broken don’t fix it. Well my old phone was broken the screen was turning into a mosaic with shards of glass desperately trying to sneak through the screen cover. It was tired and worn out, so, tine for a new model. I have a sim only contract as I prefer to own my phone & upgrade it if & when I like. Time to venture into the land of Apple iPhones, I have had an iPad for a few years, love the speed of it compared to Android. The iPhone 13 has the same speed & qualities and I am really impressed with it. It is the only phone we use, no landline. The apps are quick to open, the camera is much better quality and the aesthetics are clean and streamlined. It has a bigger screen size than my old phone all the better for us oldies and having arthritis in my hands it is easier to grip the larger size. Transferring files, settings, apps etc was a doddle. Storage capacity much bigger than I am used to. All in all I am delighted with my new phone and hope to be using it for a long while to cone,

This is my first iPhone after years of Android use. iOS is quite different, but it works fine, once you wrap your head around it. The phone itself is excellent. Beautiful to look at and listen to, incidentally. Great camera, fairly lightweight and it feels well made. It definitely lives up to the hype. Clever too that if it’s close to my iPad or MacBook, I can make or receive calls on any of them. A few foibles. You can’t just start typing a name on the phone keypad to bring up a number, Android style, and it took me a while to realise you need to press and hold to move the cursor when you’re editing text like this review. But it’s minor stuff. If you can stomach the price (which was considerably discounted here - thanks, Amazon), then you won’t be disappointed.EDIT: I’ve found a way to speed up dialling my main contacts. You can use shortcuts to build a speed dial menu which you can access via an icon on your Home Screen. Thank-you, YouTube!

Purchased for my father for Xmas.  He could not believe he'd got a new iPhone after having an iPhone 6 forever.  It's classy and I'm told very easy to transfer data and contact details across from an old phone.  One happy dad!
"
872,B09G9FB7LV,5,"
I brought this phone to upgrade from my iPhone 8 , I only needed 128 gig and didn’t need anymore, the pro and pro max didn’t interest me, this iPhone 13 does everything I need it to do, I would definitely recommend it
"
873,B09G9FB7LV,5,"
Love this phone was an upgrade from my se (2020) so much of an improvement only thing to be aware of is you need a different charger plug to the older iPhones comes with cable but no plug

874,B09G9FB7LV,5,"

Can this phone make and receive a call? Yes. Like most phones it can. So why have I rated it so badly? First of all the Face ID is a terrible idea and nobody tells you that until you’ve got one. Face ID does not work in horizontal mode so you are forever having to grab the phone and hold it vertically to open the phone after it goes to sleep. It is so annoying. Befits you’d just reach across with your finger. To actually pick it up and look at the phone is nuts. Next. To operate the phone you are for ever trying to remember all the new slide combinations to access things that before were so easy to do. For instance Square crop on photos is no longer available unless you swipe up but only in a certain area. If I could I would throw this phone in the bin and go back to my 6s which was a far better phone. Don’t buy this phone. Apple are washed up. There era is over.
"
880,B09G9FB7LV,5,"
That's ever best phone i boutght. This is to fast, 5G works fine, its nice size and not weight. I have choosen the blue one with 128GB, i guess with the 5G and cloud storage its enought. So that's my opinion about.

The iPhone 13 has the same design as last year’s iPhone 12 model, but it's internally where the differences can be found.  One of the key internal changes being an improved camera where Apple have taken last year’s much praised iPhone 12 Pro Max wide camera lens and put it into the iPhone 13... and the images are fantastic!Another key improvement is Apples new A15 bionic chip with a 6 core CPU, 4 core GPU and 4Gb of RAM (in the iPhone 13).  Currently, the A15 Bionic chip is the fastest smartphone chip in the world meaning it can handle the most demanding apps/processes and still has room to spare.It also means Apple will continue to support the iPhone 13 with software (iOS) updates for 5 to 6 years, longer than any other smartphone manufacturer.  so if you are looking for a future proof, then that's what you will be doing by buying this.The battery is also very good.  I'm not a heavy phone user but I've become accustomed to ensuring I have a charger close by 'in case' I need it, whereas with the iPhone 13 I'm comfortably getting through the day without needing to charge it... and on a several occasions into the next day too.The main differences between the iPhone 13 and iPhone Pro, or Pro Max, are:- Graphics:  The iPhone 13 has a 4 core GPU where the Pro has a 5 core GPU- Display:  The iPhone 13 has a 60Hz refresh display where the Pro has ProMotion, an adaptive display which ranges from 10 to 120Hz depending on what you are looking at or doing- Battery:  The iPhone 13 has an estimated 15 hours of continuous streaming and the Pro as 20 hours- Camera:  The iPhone 13 has a Wide Camera lens and an Ultra-Wide camera lens, where the Pro has a Wide, Ultra-Wide and a Telephoto camera lens.The Pro models also have macro photography thanks to a new Ultra-Wide camera lens which take stunning images.Overall, the iPhone 13 is a fantastic phone and ideal for anyone wanting to:a) Upgrade from a phone older than the iPhone 11b) Looking for the most future proof smart phone they can getc) Are not fussed by telephoto or macro photographyLastly, I’ve attached 5 photo examples of Photographic Styles, new feature to the iPhone 13 range.

This review is for the Apple iPhone 13 (128GB) - Starlight.Another amazing phone from Apple. Lovely designed and works great. I upgraded from a iPhone 7+ and there is a world of difference in speed and features! Fantastic and worth every penny. Should keep me going for another 5 years!Update after using for a week: still love it! iOS 15 is great love the additions to the weather app and how you listen to your voicemails. 👍🏻👍🏻2 weeks update.. still going well! So much better than my iPhone 7+

Lovely phone beautiful made in a combined glass mineral and aluminium construction. Easy to use with a lot of thought that has gone into how this works embracing the very best of the latest technology. Very delighted with it. But, after setting it up on the day I received it, it started an update to IOS 15.4.1. The next day it was bricked! I tried hardware resets many times, updates through iTunes over and over and factory resets many many times. In the end I have had to send the phone off to Apple to be repaired. I still think this is a good phone though. And online Apple support is really good. But I can't help feeling disappointed that this can happen.As an update, Apple fixed this very quickly. Very impressed and a great phone! Added a well deserved star because of the superb product supported by a superb service.

Rivedo il mio primo giudizio. Dopo due anni dì pandemia il Face ID è decisamente superato. Meglio un bel Touch ID o un riconoscimento biometrico oculare, per esempio. Anche la tastiera va migliorata. È inaccettabile il continuo swap tra lettere e numeri.Primo commento: Non avrei mai pensato di innamorarmi di un cellulare 😅. È semplicemente perfetto, e il colore è fuori di testa! Spedizione impeccabile come sempre

This will be a long and detailed review. I am writing this to guide those who are hesitant whether to get an iPhone or not, and which iPhone to get. I will start by focusing on the iPhone 13 Pro model, but I will speak more generally towards the end, especially when comparing iOS versus Android Products.iPhone 13 Pro Overview:I had the chance to unbox this device and set it up as my new main device. Prior to this I was using a Samsung Note and a Realme smartphones.- Box Contents and Eco-Friendliness:The iPhone 13 Pro box contains paper leaflets, sticker, a cable, and of course phone. The phone itself is wrapped in recyclable material rather than eco-unfriendly plastic. Part of the switch to Apple is what I personally see as an effort from them to go green, in addition to other reasons I will discuss below.- Design and Build Quality:The iPhone 13 Pro is simply amazing in terms of design. Holding it feels almost like holding the previous 12 Pro model, albeit the 13 Pro comes with noticeable bigger cameras and smaller notch.The body is flawless and the graphite option is the best in my view as I like neutral-lowkey'ish colours. The other colours are equally appealing but the graphite just felt suitable for my personal tastes. The side frame is stainless steel and the whole phone feels really solid. I have seen JerryRig's video where he tries to bend the iPhone 13 Pro and phone managed to survive and stay fully intact. Jerry also used a lighter to try and burn the screen, and it didn't! Despite being exposed to continuous lighter flames for around a minute (You should check it out).Compared to the 12 Pro, the iPhone 13 Pro is slightly heavier (209g vs 189g) and slightly thicker (7.7mm vs 7.4mm).- Specs:Stats are the last thing I consider recently since most flagships pack the latest technology and all fly through tasks easily. We seem to live in an age where the hardware capabilities is outweighing the requirements of most, if not all, apps and games.The iPhone 13 Pro packs a 3095 mAH battery which is bigger and better than the previous iPhone 12 Pro's battery. It has a Super Retina XDR OLED display with a 120HZ refresh rate (Finally they left the old 60HZ rate). The refresh rate is variable, meaning that drops for less demanding apps, which adds to the preserving of energy. The display is very bright and can be seen easily and clearly in bright daylight. It has a brightness of 1000nits with a peak of 1200nits. It packs the latest Apple A15 bionic 5 nanometer chip. This chip provides fast performance and adds to iPhones' AI capabilities. The GPU has five cores compared to four in the 12 Pro. The  iPhone 13 Pro comes with 6GB of RAM but we know that doesn't really matter since it is faster than phones with 12GB of RAM. So enough with the dull specs and lets talk about the actual performance!- Speed and Responsiveness:The iPhone, iPad and MacBook family is well-known for its flawlessness in terms of responsiveness, and this iPhone 13 Pro is no different. Expect a very fast performance that wouldn't degrade for years. Apps open fast and all operations happen seamlessly. Although the iOS 15 is relatively a new update, there isn't much bugs around, and a couple small bugs highlighted by customers have already been patched.- Battery Life and charging:The iPhone only comes with a lightning cable, so if you never owned an Apple device you may need to get a wall plug. The iPhone only requires 23W load, but it still supports a convenient level of fast charging, making it able to go from 0% to 50% in 30 minutes. I think Apple could have gone way higher in terms of load, and way lower in terms of charging time, but that would equally reduce the shelf life of the battery and makes it degrade quickly, so a sweet middle spot is more convenient for long term owners. A fully charged iPhone 13 Pro would sustain you for the whole day, with around 30% remaining at the end of the day. My test is based on a day of regular surfing, watching videos, taking pictures and videos (like stories and reels), and casual gaming (like candy crush). The battery performance is way better than the 12 Pro in my opinion, and second just to the 13 Pro max.Note: there are phones that go from 0% to 60 or 80% in way less time than the iPhone 13 Pro. As I have said those phones are speculated to degrade the battery life span faster and release a lot of heat, but it is up to you to decide your preferences, especially if you constantly forget to charge your phone at night and you require very fast charging.- Camera Quality and Modes:Over the years, iPhones never possessed the best camera title. Rather, they managed to earn the best round-up camera performance. For instance, there are telephoto lenses better than the iPhone 13 Pro telephoto, and a wide angle that's better than the iPhone 13 Pro. however, in my view there is no phone that combines a robust multi-lens performance as good as the iPhone does. If you want a versatile camera, an incredible bokeh effect, a crisp and sharp video with the best stabilisation I ever tried, and an amazing post-production processing and editing, then I am certain no phone can outweigh the current iPhone 13 Pro and Pro max. The quality is simply amazing and the software support accompanying the camera app is what sets this years head of the rest. I advise you to check videos that showcase the camera performance.- Software Support and iOS 15:There are many people out there who don't understand why people pay much for iPhones. These people are usually unaware of the seamlessness created by the Apple eco-system. Having an iPhone, iPad, MacBook, and to a lesser extent a watch and earbuds, is the only resort for you to understand how the ecosystem works. I was suspicious a year ago but once into the ecosystem, I am certain that there is no other combination of devices out there that can achieve the same ecosystem.The iOS 15 update, and soon the Mac Monetary update, are expected to take this ecosystem to an even higher league. For instance, and at this particular moment, I can copy the text I am writing on my MacBook and just press paste on my iPad or iPhone and it will paste. I can use my iPad as a secondary screen by pressing a single button. I can create a work routine or a set of actions once I activate Focus Mode, and my devices can even inform people on iMessage that I am busy or not available. I can start a task in one device, work on it somewhere else with another device without the need to login again or try to get access or upload stuff here and there.The ecosystem is indeed a closed system. This can be discouraging for some but it equally creates a chain of cohesive actions that facilitate your daily tasks.I will not talk much about iOS 15 and leave you the pleasure to explore that. Else you can check relevant videos to see the new features.- PrivacyPerhaps one of the main reasons that dragged me towards Apple in general is their emphasis on data protection and privacy. The new Private Relay and Hide my Email features are nothing but evidence on how serious Apple is about privacy. I feel more secure inside this ecosystem and more in control of what I want to share/not share with other parties.- Final Verdict:The final verdict is mixed and conditional. The main thing to say is that the iPhone 13 Pro, like the other flagships in the markets, packs the latest technology available. Whether it is right for you or not depends on how you answer the following:1. Do you own other Apple products? If you already own a MacBook, and iPad, an Apple Watch, or a combination of all then the iPhone would make things even better.2. Do you own an iPhone and you are uncertain about upgrading: If you have an iPhone 11 or lower then I would advise you to upgrade if you can afford the 12 Pro. The major differences would be the battery life, the display, and the cameras. These are MAJOR differences and will make you feel a huge difference. If you own the iPhone 12 Pro I would advise you to not upgrade, unless you really crave the latest technology and cannot live without the new cameras and higher refresh rate. You won't feel a MAJOR difference, but the difference will be noticeable.3. Are you switching from Android to iOS? My short answer will be: If you don't mind a closed system that would function better if you own other Apple products then definitely go for it. The future of privacy and protection seems better with the iPhone (personal view). Plus, with the iPhone you get loads of software updates and Apple will not discontinue their support after two years like most others do. Switching from Android/Windows to Apple is gradual and starts with one device. I started with one device and now own 4 devices that make my life easier.4. Should you go with the mini, the 13, the 13 Pro or the 13 max? If your current phone is smaller than the iPhone 13 and you hate bulky and big devices then go with the mini. If your priority is having the latest all rounder without necessarily flexing in terms of performance then go with the 13. If you want the most iPhones can offer, you game a lot, or you are into photography like me then go with the 13 Pro. If the 13 Pro looks small in your eye and you want something that falls between a smartphone and tablet in terms of size, along with the highest battery capacity possible then consider the 13 Pro Max. But before you decide on this, think about your budget and whether you can afford your preferred phone or not.5. Should you go for the 12 Pro over the 13 Pro? At this particular time NO. The 12 Pro is still expensive and I wouldn't pay that much for it. If you can afford a brand new 12 Pro then save a little more and get a 13 Pro. If you want a 12 Pro wait till January and prices may go lower.6. If you think that the iPhone is expensive then check other brands and you will realise that they are charging the same amount or almost the same amounts without offering the same level of support and updates.I may update this review as I use my phone and discover new stuff. I hope you find this helpful and I hope I managed to assist you in making a decision. I will include samples of pictures taken by my 13 Pro soon, I may also include a video or two.Important: If you read this review and found it helpful you might find my Apple Watch Series 7 review helpful as well. Just click on my profile picture and you will see it as the first review on my profile.

Maybe this will get something done!I am a very very unhappy customer.25th November I contacted customer services as my phone wouldn’t charge or power up at all. I was asked to send my phone together with the PIN number so the repairs team could access my phone and that it would take 14 days from receipt to fix or refund.I duly sent my phone with all the details requested.  Having not heard anything i called to check if it had been received as the status was showing as not yet and the woman confirmed it had been received that morning and would be 14 days from then.On the 13th i realised I still have not heard anything so run an amazon search in my emails and see UK Norwich Amazon come up in the search. I click the email to see if it was connected to the repair and it was an email saying that they had tried to contact me to give them information and as I had not replied they would be sending my phone back to me un repaired via DPD within 3-5 days.I emailed back to say this is the first email I have seen and what was the status of my phone. The response to this was it was not fixed and being sent via Royal Mail. I was very cross about this as not only have I been told different things with regards to timescales (it is at. This point 3 weeks without my phone). I respond to say as much and Gary at Norwich repairs respond highlighting his email saying he said Royal Mail and quite rudely telling me there was no mention of DPD. I responded with the email from Norwich saying DPD two days earlier and asked for a refund as they cannot repair, I was ignored.I contacted amazon directly to try and get this resolved. The first person i speak with, tells me they have escalated to the repairs team and no i cannot speak with a manager because they have left the room. I said I will wait, she put me on hold and then cut me off.  I call back and the man I speak with is more helpful but again the manager he puts me through to tells me, she is going to issue me a refund and confirms my card details and then comes back and says it has to be the repairs team and she has escalated it.I then get an email from Norwich saying my phone has not actually been sent to me yet. Despite it apparently being sent to me four days ago 13th December. The 16th Dec I call and speak directly to Gary and ask for the refund.  Gary said this is not something they can do and that Amazon have misinformed me and that he will reply in an email to say as much.I call Amazon back after Gary sent an email confirming it is no them who issue the refund and the man i speak to tried to help as best he can but again, he asks me to sen him screen shots of the emails which i do but we get no where. He is told to give me this email and; that I am to wait for my broken phone to be sent back to me which is delayed by 4 days already, and over the 14 days for a return or refund, for me to them get back in contact once I receive the broken phone to send it back to you to start this whole process back again.THIS IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH - This is terrible customer service. Please can you just refund me. You have sold me a phone that doesn’t work, i have done as you asked and I do not have the phone, amazon do. I should not be being asked to jump through hoops. I have rights as a consumer and I have requested my refund several times now.Please can you issue me my refund as you are unable to repair the item, you as yet have not sent me the item and I need to go and purchase another.I have been without my phone for 23 days now.Overall I have been sold a dud iPhone and then poor customer service. Am out of pocket by over £1000 and still without my money or my phone.

I hesitated for weeks before placing my order. I had an old iPhone SE that I loved and stubbornly refused to let go, replacing the battery a year ago. But the screen started to glitch in the summer, pink lines everywhere, black stain spreading at the top. Still I could not order a new one as I just did not like them; they seemed way too big. I liked the colour of the iPhone 14 but saw it in store and hated the glass back (fingerprints everywhere). Ended up ordering the 13 pro after watching many videos and I love it. Yes it’s much bigger than the SE but I got used to it in a couple of days. And the colour is beautiful. It is extremely expensive but hopefully I can keep it for years. The pictures taken so far are stunning. I recommend it.

It arrived so fast! I am using the cellphone for two months now and the battery it's good, but as I use it a lot I charge it every day. For me, the highest point is the camera, we get a very good image even with poor light. Also, the velocity to open the apps, change the screen or delete apps and photos is awesome. I really recommend the purchase.

Bought this as a “like new” big discount. It was sent quickly and when it arrived it came in the original package, cable and manuals were even included. To my surprise the device was shiny new, 100% battery health. On settings only shown that it had the rear system had been replaced and it was genuine.

I don't write reviews in general but this time my experience was so bad that I have to review this purchase.As from the headline, I bought three times an iPhone 13 pro, and each time I returned the product because in each case the iPhone was defective.At first, I bought a pre-owned iPhone 13 pro from Amazon Warehouse. The iPhone was in good shape with no scratches at all. Unfortunately, as soon as I switched on the iPhone, I realized the phone was not able to find any mobile network, as if the sim card was not present in the phone. However the sim card was inserted, meaning that this was clearly an issue of the iPhone. It was a Graphite iPhone, whose box is in picture denoted as 1. I understand this is a pre-owned phone and there could be some imperfections, but it is not acceptable that Amazon does not verify if the phone works or not. I guess the quality checks are quite poor if faults like this are not detected before selling the phone.I returned this iPhone and I decided not to trust Amazon Warehouse, so I bought a new one, you can see it in the two pictures denoted as 2. The phone was perfectly working but after a while I noticed a cosmetic imperfection on the camera section. As you can see in the picture, the black circle of the sensor has something like a smear that makes the circle not perfectly circular. I could not have done this damage because the smear is under the glass of the camera. At this point I thought: Why should I keep a defective phone, considering that I paid almost 1000 pounds for it and that, if I want to sell it one day, someone may notice the imperfection and give me less money?I guessed I had been quite unlucky with the two iPhones so I decided to return this second iPhone and to order a third one.The third iPhone 13 pro arrived in the conditions shown in the two pictures denoted as 3. I could not believe it, but there were a small scratch on the upper frame of the phone and some scratches on the grey band on the lateral frame. Notice that these pictures were taken immediately after removing the phone from the box, so I could not have caused these scratches. Again, for the same reasons as the previous one, I did not accept this iPhone and I immediately returned it.At this point my opinion was that it was not me being unlucky, but Apple production/quality check must be very poor and I really lost esteem for this company.At the end I bought a 4th iPhone 13 pro, which fortunately is in good conditions. But during all this procedure of returning and buying iPhones I lost a lot of time and patience and I put a lot of money since I had to buy a new one before the refund for the previous one arrived.I am really unsatisfied both for Amazon Warehouse for the first iPhone and for Apple for the remaining two.

This iPhone is honestly amazing. The battery can last all day and the camera is phenomenal, the colour is beautiful and the screen is really good and charging is really quick as well.You don’t need a 14 pro/14, just buy a 13 pro/13 and you’ll be really happy because the 13 and 14 are literally the same phone but the 13 is cheaper and will last a really long time.Summery the 13 pro is an amazing phone and I recommend this to everyone.

Bought for my eldest daughter to replace an iPhone 11 which had a cracked screen (since fixed and that phone now with my youngest daughter). This is a lovely phone and she's over the moon with it - as alwasy Amazon was exceelent, delivery was next day and we've had no problems at all.

Once you’re hooked into the Apple ecosystem they’ve got you - I usually buy new phones every couple of releases/years so came to this from an 11Pro. Incremental updates rather than blow away features. I also buy the handsets sim free and this enables me to have a small £10 per month sim only tariff but it’s swings and roundabouts.

Get the Pro. I'd never had a Pro before, I didn't see the point. The camera is the point! We all think ""Oh I don't take that many pictures anyway"", you definitely take more than you realise. The quality is stunning, there are so many modes and ways of editing, it's just superb!If anyone is coming from an XS, like me, this one does not have a glass back, I promise. It's titanium I think and properly damage resistant.The battery lasts astonishingly long. I got nearly 2 full days of regular use out of a fully charged 13 Pro battery when I got it.Just brilliant, 100% just spend the extra money and enjoy a quality product :)

Had a trusty iPhone 7 for the past four or five years then battery life dropped off and became near useless for a whole day without chargingUpgraded to the iPhone 13 pro, night and day for the battery, I can easily get two to three days usage. Size is good though slightly bigger than the iPhone 7, weight takes a little get used to. Performance and experience is better though the iOS is the same, overall very happy with the upgrade. Let’s see if it can last 4 or 5 years

I love everything about this phone. Coming from the XR this was the perfect upgrade. Pro motion makes the phone extremely fast. The camera is sensational. Overall the phone is sensational.
"
958,B09G997T36,5,"
Face  recognition was new to me and I love it. The lack of home button is new to me also and so much easier. The camera is terrific and the battery life will take several hours of continuous google maps use.

The iPhone is simply amazing, the colour Sierra Blue is beautiful and elegant and I highly recommend it. I upgraded from an iPhone 6s to a 13 pro and the difference is abysmal.Regarding the delivery was fast as expected.

I’ve had to his phone for about 2 months but every now and then the screen sticks. Also my daughter has an iPhone 13 pro and we both keep losing sound quality. Could this be a bug? May have to return the phone.

This iPhone is really handsome.The camera offers near perfect perfection and the zoom lens is an improvement this time around.The general functions on the iPhone are more fluid and the colour pixelation is greatly improved.Battery life has also been improved.Buy yourself this phone while you can because this is a real market leading winner from Apple.

Upgraded from iphone 11 which was broke at work and I had to get a new one. No regret with my iphone 13 pro which is faster than 11, good cameras, smooth and solid. Just downside of this phone is not to have c port rather than that is a great phone.

Received this phone yesterday. It has a problem with a grey tint on 90% of the screen. Apple advise to return. Amazon refuse to allow me to return until Apple issue a letter of denial, whatever that is. Not sure what to do - - stuck with £1000 phone that doesn’t work and Amazon won’t exchange.Update: went to Apple store, who confirmed that there is a problem and said they would have replaced there and then if I hadn’t bought from Amazon. They did not know what a letter of denial was. Having spoken to a senior Apple engineer, advice was to insist Amazon accept it as a return especially as it’s less than a week old. Phoned  Amazon, very helpful man said he couldn’t action a return as it is a high value item. Am waiting another call….so less than a week, a non working phone and not sure what happens next…But moral is Amazon aren’t good if things go wrong …

Best iPhone ever, until the iPhone 14.The camera is the most impressive feature of the new iPhone 13, it's just insanely good for non-professional use.I think the cinematic mode is a bit gimmicky, but it's fun to play with.
"
979,B09G997T36,5,"
Excellent phone would advise to upgrade if you can safe up.
"
980,B09G997T36,5,"

I bought this device to replace a battered second-hand iPhone 11 and I love this phone.The battery life on this phone is exceptional and can easily last a day or even up to 1.5 days depending on usage. With the 120hz refresh rate, you can see the difference in speed and opening up apps in comparison to a 60hz phone.I love to take pictures/random pictures daily and this phone captures amazing photos during the day and the low light photography on this iPhone is one of the best you can get anywhere. The photos come out light, bright and crispyNow, a little negative for some would be the weight of this phone as it weighs just over 200g and can put some weight in your pockets, but it does fit perfectly in pockets/handbags, unlike the bigger 13 Pro Max. But this isn't really a problem for meWould I recommend his phone? hmm, only if you have the budget and absolutely have to have the best of the best tech and battery life. Otherwise, I'd say go with the regular 13 or even the 13 mini

It's pointless to buy iPhones for basically new price after a year... you've already lost nearly 20% of it's supported life (usually about 5-6 years)... so it's actually costing you more, per year, to buy these phones than when new...! irrespective of how nice, fast, how good camera is or how incredibly dated and old-fashioned the entire home screen and 'flow' interface is.
"
1008,B09G997T36,4,"
Go for it. Such a magic is 13 pro. No words to describe its beauty. Camera with Inbuilt filter is awesome
"
1009,B09G997T36,5,"
Arrived quickly and packaging was spot on! This phone is bang on!  nice screen quality and very responsive.I’ve upgraded from the iPhone 11 and there’s a great difference in camera quality resolution quality as well although it’s a wee bit chunky this is by far a better phone! A Well recommend upgrade 👍👌

Always had iPhone as they are the best in the business but……..No plug charger with a phone just sort of £1000 and also, I’ve got an iPad Pro and the cables are different connections which is so annoying.Come on Apple, we pay a premium already to buy the best but penny pinching isn’t on!!!
"
1011,B09G997T36,5,"
I Didn’t Buy This From Amazon Unfortunately But I Bought It From The Apple Store Itself But I Just Wanted To Put My Experience With The Phone On Here Well First Of All This Phones 120hz I can tell immediately near my iPhone 10And these new cameras are worth the whole 949 pounds I paid and the 128gb is more than enough considering iCloud storage and the colour I hope they keep for next year .

1012,B09G997T36,5,"
7 years with Samsung, finally got bored of all the hype and broken promises so moved back to apple and pleased to say that I am very happy with it. Android to apple data migration is a pain and still have some issues with basic services due to android placing some sort of plan on my number, who will not help. Annoying. However, this phone is bang on. Every app just works and the cameras (especially recording) are great fun.
"
1013,B09G997T36,5,"
I’ve been with Android for 11 years and decided to change to the 13 pro and honestly this phone is unbelievably good. The 120hz display is very fluid and lovely to use, the camera quality is the best I’ve seen on any phone, I love IPhone cameras anyway but this takes it to another level. Also, the speaker quality is so clear and crisp, along with being the loudest I’ve heard on a phone. The Battery life is phenomenal, I can easily get around 9 hours screen on time. Only downsides are it hasn’t got usb c charging and the facial recognition doesn’t work with masks on. Other than that it’s an amazing phone, go and get one, you won’t regret it!

Hi  I would really like to warn everybody about the iPhone 13 Pro as it is really not working properly.  I got the new iPhone 13 Pro just before Christmas and it was very faulty, and EE sent me out a new one, which turns out to be very faulty too.  Since I’ve had new replacement phones now, they will not give me a new phone, but a refurbished one as I am now over the Moth period and this is extremely unfair. As you may, or not be aware of, the Americans are extremely Superstitious and usually they don’t have anything to do with the number 13 and when building they do not have a thirteenth floor in any of their hotels or skyscrapers.  This is why it doesn’t make sense that they brought out the new iPhone as the number 13?  It has been unbelievable and I’ve not had a pleasurable experience with the iPhone13 Pro and I would like to let all those who are extremely superstitious to stay away from this new iPhone and If they do get one, then you’ve all been warned.
"
1015,B09G997T36,4,"
I've been using a Pixel 6 Pro and an iPhone 8 as my daily usage phones until I finally decided to buy the iPhone 13 Pro (note: I bought this in a shop, since Amazon had no stock at the time - I bought the Graphite 13 Pro with 256GB storage). I will give my thoughts and experiences from an unbiased view of both an Android and iOS userFirstly, you notice the build quality. This is something Apple has always done really well, and really, nobody else seems to have caught up. It just has such a pleasant feeling holding it hand. No Android phone I've come across in my time (I'm including all flagship phones), have ever managed to replicate that same feeling. I'm talking about holding the phone when it's switched off. It just oozes quality, and I must admit nobody have matched them on this front.The display is the next thing you notice, it's really nice with a crisp display, with high enough pixel density that you cannot see the pixels. I also like the fact the whites seems naturally to be a warmer than my android phones which seem to have a slightly bluer tint to them. Also it's the brightest display I've come across, turning that and the Pixel 6 Pro to max brightness, and there's no competition. If you're the phones side by side in bright daylight, you're definitely going to see the iPhone better.Security unlocking. Previously I've been used to using a finger print sensor. Apple have FaceID, and I must say it's pretty neat, certainly less fuss than fingerprint scanner, especially if you're outside and wearing touch screen compatible gloves. I've noticed you can't have the phone too close to your face though, so a good half arms length away is a minimum. The bigger issue though is in the world of Covid and facemasks, I found it simple doesn't work with a facemask on. I've been told you can work around this by buying an Apple Watch though - but of course that's significant additional cost (plus you might actually prefer a different brand watch).Pros- Very wide aperture (f1.5 main lens) cameras with nice large sensors make for great low light photography- Finally a 3x zoom lens- Lovely display, very nice to look at. Can go very bright, brighter than other phones.- Phone is super responsive, scroll is much smoother than the iPhone 8, and I'd say marginally better than the Pixel 6 Pro in that respect- Magsafe a very nice addition for wireless charging - works really with (so long as you don't use a case or a compatible case)- Battery lasts the whole dayCons- Lacks fingerprint scanner- Face ID not well adapted to the world of facemasks- Protruding camera lens cluster affects usage with some wireless charging stands- Pixel 6 Pro offers 4x zoom lens, rivalling picture quality and neat exclusive AI photo processing for significantly less money. (But that phone's not perfect either)- Still uses lightning adaptor for charging as opposed to USB-CIssues with in general I found migrating from Android to iOS, not necessarily iPhone 13 Pro specifically- Whatsapp won't (at time of writing) transfer chat history from Android to iOS, requires paying for 3rd party solutionNote I've put a screen protector and camera lens protector on it from new. Also, I use a case, so these might show in some of the pictures.Summary:At £949 for the base model, you get a very nice premium product. However on balance, in my opinion it's not a clear winner vs the Pixel 6 Pro which I've been using day to day along side it.If you are already Apple invested and you're running an iPhone 11 or older, then it's a clear purchase - it's probably not worth your hassle converting to android for the current offerings at this time.If you have a recent flagship Android phone, again I wouldn't recommend switching over to iOS just for this phone. (I took the plunge because my car only supports CarPlay and I was replacing an iPhone 8).If you have an iPhone 12, then it's a tough call. Yes it's a better camera, but is it enough to justify the huge cost of upgrade? - I probably wouldn't.Overall, it's a really good phone with an outstanding camera, but it's not perfection

How can a phone cost over £1000 and you don't get no charger or headphone in the box
"
1017,B09G997T36,5,"
Upgraded from an iPhone 6s. Massive upgradeBattery lasts for a day.Screen is amazing.Speakers are louder and clearer.Phone is slightly thicker and with square edges can dig in fingers as it’s a bigger phone than the 6s. But a good case will sort this.  Done get this wrong the phone looks amazing so worth the design choiceChose this over the max as you can still use this one handed.Invest in a fast charger as Charing with the old iPhone chargers takes forever. If you charge overnight then no problem but on that rare occasion the battery is low the old charger will feel like an eternity to charge

I’ve moved from an XR; decent enough all rounder but still average battery life and a mediocre camera.This is almost the same size but noticeably heavier but it feels so much more “ premium.”Battery life is at least doubled and the camera really is outstanding. I’m no pro but attached a macro and a sunset shot just to show off it’s capabilities.I got the 256GB for the additional video feature which I’ve yet to use.A superb piece of kit protected by an OtterBox Strava folio case; also superb.

With the exception of some small differences the iPhone 13 Pro looks much the same as last year’s iPhone 12 Pro, but internally it’s a different story as it’s here where improvement have been made to the:- Camera- Camera features- Display- Chip/Performance- BatteryCameraThe iPhone 13 Pro has 3 camera lenses, a:1. Wide Camera lens2. Telephoto lens with a x0.5 to x3 optical zoom and a x15 digital zoom.3. Ultra-Wide Camera lens, which for the first time has macro mode:  The ability to take photos or video just 2cm awayCamera featuresThe iPhone 13 Pro has:1. Photographic Styles2. Cinematic modePhotographic Styles are 5 pre-set warmth and tones settings which can be further adjusted if you want.  The pre-sets are ‘Standard’, ‘Rich-Contrast’, ‘Vibrant’, ‘Warm’ and ‘Cool’.Cinematic mode like portrait mode focusses on a subject – either automatically or manually – blurring out the background… and can be refocussed onto another subject if they too come into frame.  The idea is to give a more professional feel to video much like a professional camera, and it is a lot of fun to use, but for more serious camera work it’s not perfect.DisplayAnother new feature to the Pro model is ProMotion.ProMotion is an adaptive display which automatically changes from 10Hz to 120Hz depending on what you’re doing or looking at.  Unfortunately, there are almost no games which can use the 120Hz display but this will change in time… although it is currently noticeable when scrolling quickly between screens or images/text.Chip/PerformanceApple’s new A15 bionic chip is in all the iPhone 13 models.  A 6-core CPU with a 5-core GPU in the Pro models, compared to a 4-core GPU in the regular iPhone 13.  To get straight to the point, the A15 bionic chip is currently the fastest smartphone chip in the world… meaning can comfortably handle the most demanding processes and apps… and still has room to spare!The A15 bionic chip also means Apple will continue support the iPhone 13 range with software (iOS) updates for the next 5-6 years, longer than any other smartphone manufacture.  Meaning it’s ideal for anyone looking to future proof their phone.In addition there is also 6Gb of RAM.BatteryThe battery has been fantastic.  I’m not a heavy phone user, so I’m comfortably getting through the day and often into the next the next day without needing to charge it – although this varies depending on what I’m doing.However, when you look at what the battery is supporting – an improved camera, features, display and a faster chip…. it’s very good.SummaryThe iPhone 13 Pro is an extremely well-engineered phone and what it does, it does well.  If you want or need a telephoto lens, macro mode or the fastest possible smartphone chip out there.  Then get the iPhone 13 Pro.

Definitely recommend, i always buy refurbished to save on money, never any issues. Really lovely phone, gorgeous shade of pink, no issues with it (:

1045,B09MGGF9JG,1,"
I had high expectations after purchasing an “excellent” condition refurbished phone.Instead, my phone arrived with a noticeable scratch to the screen below the front facing camera (disappointing as I’ve never had scratches on any of my phones that are 2+ years old!)Also the phone arrived with no battery (expected at least 50%)Then when transferring data, this took longer than ever before taking nearly an hour to install the latest iOS update and transfer data from phones. In the past this process has taken 5-10 mins so this was inconvenient as I couldn’t use my old phone during this time either.Aside from the above, operations seem to function as normal at first glance.A few days into owning my refurbed phone - I have noticed Face ID isn’t half as efficient as my old phone. I find I’m constantly having to put the phone directly in front of my face / or many times being asked for input passcode instead. I find it strange that when setting up Face ID on this phone I only have the option to do 1 face analysis, and not the second more accurate analysis which I believe is the problem.3 days into owning this phone I have noticed there is a fault with the camera in photo mode therefore I’m sending this device back and ordering brand new. Doubt I’ll order refurb again.

The phone was in perfect condition! Really something to change your opinion on refurbished devices.I was particularly fond of the packaging! Thought was clearly put into waste and the came with a charging cable and plug (not original, but no way a problem at all).The battery ‘health’ was at 100% which was incredible to see, so not sure if this was changed, or whether the phone was very new (certainly looked it).FaceRecognition wise I have yet to try, will update if any issues! (Thought I very much doubt it with the way it came).Only problem, is I’d knock £100-200 off the price, because, well, why not ;) , but in all seriousness, perfect condition and happy so far!

A good seller who replies within 1 day.Phones are in quite good condition. Packaging can be improved. Price is very decent. The devices should be cleaned better before they get dispatched to the customers.I got 1 x iphone 13 pro max 256gb ""excellent"" condition which was excellent indeed. 94% battery but I had to spend some time cleaning the edges and cameras of the phone from dirt.I also ordered 1 x iphone 13 pro 256gb accidentally ""excellent condition"". This was not a real excellent since it came with lots of scratches on the screen. the battery life was 99% though.Overall, I recommend the seller since you're backed up by Amazon. He communicates well and he listens to his customers

The phone arrived with no damage to the outside which is to be expected as I ordered it in “excellent condition” it seems to be working well no problems noticed yet, only had it for over a week, battery life was 91% which is what disappointed me the most as I would expect higher for this condition.
"
1067,B0BBP48ZTY,5,"
Looks like new, works like new. Genuinely can’t see a single scratch. Battery life is still at 97% which is grand. Arrived early, cameras and Face ID all work. Screen is likely the original as True Tone still works. You just need to have a paper clip handy to get the sim tray open because it doesn’t come with the original packaging (pretty standard for refurbished phones in my experience). Great phone, should last well!

The phone is literally like a brand new phone. There is 1 tiny scratch on the screen which you cannot notice unless you try to look for it and the battery life is fantastic. The battery health is 98% which is practically new. Would highly recommend buying this over a brand new phone as you get more or less a new phone for much cheaper price

I had this phone for nearly a month and most of my friends were complaining about sound quality . I actually thought that they might not have good signal because of the wind , but it was poorly for Wi-Fi too. Kind of feeling bad for blaming their devices for the fault.It is cutting through phrases and freeze on video call. FaceTime is glitching and it is not from iOS because I have another 12 pro max which has no issues.I requested to return the item, but this is a small inconvenience. The rest of the phone is great, but if you can’t talk to the phone it is a BIG issue.

I have upgraded my iPhone 11 Pro Max to the 13 Pro Max.If you’re debating going for the new 14 Plus, I would instead look into purchasing a renewed 13 Pro Max. Not only do both phones have most of the same features, the 13 Pro Max also has ProMotion 120hz display which is an extremely noticeable difference moving from the 11 Pro Max.People will most certainly have different experiences buying a renewed phone, however I received mine in almost pristine condition (only a slight hair line scratch at the bottom of the screen, only visible in certain angles), the battery is at 99% health which is basically a new phone.All in all I would recommend going for a renewed phone if you’re looking so save the extra £££ and still receive the latest features.

Iphones hot spot is complete and utter garbage and I'm not the only one that's noticed. I used to use my 10yr old Samsung S8s hotspot for everything. It wasn't even 5g enabled. It was consistent, devices connected automatically and there was no problems. After switching to iPhone I never thought I'd be stepping back 15 yrs. I now effectively do not have a hot spot. Devices do not connect automatically (Even my Mac which connects without fail to my old android) if devices do connect they regularly disconnect and or just stop working. I had never seen the exclamation mark symbol on the wifi status bar on Mac until I regrettably switched to iPhone. iPhone doesn't even let you go in and see what is connected to the hot spot either, you just have to guess. The way you have to make the hotspot discoverable is ridiculous too, you need to leave it on the settings screen, but if you're using an app like trying to get an Alexa or a smart watch connected you have to come off it, so its no longer discoverable. I had to use my android to connect my Alexa to my iPhone. Just ridiculous, no option to make hot spot permanently discoverable but I suppose it's neither here nor there because it often doesn't work anyway! I write this review on my Mac with my iPhone plugged in via USB and wifi off because surprise surprise, the hot spot isn't working. Please note I've wasted countless hours on resetting network settings and trying this that and the other thing. The problem is it's an iPhone and iPhones have absolutely garbage connectivity and no amount of resetting or changing settings will change that. There is countless online threads on iPhones non existent hotspot, some of which go back years. it's 2023 and iPhone still acts like it's 2004 and tethering doesn't yet exist. Will be changing back to android asap

I have upgraded from iPhone 12 Pro and what a difference!+ 120Hz ProMotion display is buttery smooth and superb;+ battery life is exceptional (lasts all day easily with a very heavy use!);+ A15 is a power monster of a processor and nothing can hold it back;+ 6GB of RAM is more than enough and iOS runs like a rocket;+ very premium feel and perfect finish, which as always is expected from Apple;My main 2 reason for upgrading was superb battery life (compared to 12 Pro)and 120Hz high refresh rate display. Those 2 reasons are big enough reasonsand massive improvements that a phone is worth upgrading to!

I initially was going to return the phone as there was a very visible scratch on the screen. I changed my mind as it is a reconditioned phone. I purchased a screen protector and all at the moment is good. The phone itself is easy to use and a little bigger than I am used to but I am pleased.

I have upgraded from iPhone 12 Pro and what a difference!+ 120Hz ProMotion display is buttery smooth and superb;+ battery life is exceptional (lasts all day easily with a very heavy use!);+ A15 is a power monster of a processor and nothing can hold it back;+ 6GB of RAM is more than enough and iOS runs like a rocket;+ very premium feel and perfect finish, which as always is expected from Apple;My main 2 reason for upgrading was superb battery life (compared to 12 Pro)and 120Hz high refresh rate display. Those 2 reasons are big enough reasonsand massive improvements that a phone is worth upgrading to!

I initially was going to return the phone as there was a very visible scratch on the screen. I changed my mind as it is a reconditioned phone. I purchased a screen protector and all at the moment is good. The phone itself is easy to use and a little bigger than I am used to but I am pleased.

Before we start, apologies for the long review, but I hope it's useful! This is a resubmission of my previous review, as for some reason it has disappeared from Amazon….So another year and another iPhone has launched. Now, I have to admit I didn't intend to buy this year, having had the 12 until now. However having my phone stolen, it had to be replaced.This years range is a mild revision over last year but that, in this case, is a good thing! So let’s break it down.Design:This years design borrows a lot from last years, and I think that’s a positive! Now, I know it’s subjective, but one of the things I like about the angular shaping of the 12 & 13 is that they feel less inclined to slip out of your hand. They feel well weighted, light but not excessively so and the anodised aluminium frame feels great in the hand. They also have the benefit of being more durable than previous models due to stronger glass, but it’s always suggested to use a screen protector.As a side note to the design, if you are looking at the 12 cases and wonder if they will fit, I’m afraid to say that they won’t. The camera hump is a slightly different size and has been moved on the back. Just something to be aware of before your new device comes.Performance:This is a area that I can’t say much about, but that’s not a negative. Apple devices, for better and worse, are always faster, smoother and more fluid than their android counterparts. I still have my first gen iPhone SE in the drawer, which I kept as a back up. It’s still snappy, quick and capable of keeping up with the pace of use, even today, so I expect this device to be no different. Scrolling and app opening/closing is buttery smooth, memory is more than adequate and overall it’s a good showing.Battery life:This is one of the areas where the 13 family really takes the lead above it’s previous iterations. Compared to my 12, I am getting at least 20% more screen on time per charge, which is very impressive. In addition, charging time appears to have dropped slightly over last years model, hitting 100% from zero about 10 percent faster than last year.Cameras:Once again, this is a small improvement, but considering the performance ability of the 12’s camera array, we are onto another winner. The main sensor now contains an improved optical image stabilisation system, which now stabilises the whole image sensor and not just the lens. This benefits the user greatly in night shots and if you’re a little shaky when holding the device. The wide angle lens is also a couple of degrees wider than last year. The image processor pulls out more image noise than the 12 too. A solid result.Warranty, support and repairs:One area that stands ahead of most is in the availability of support and repairs. All Apple stores have the ability to complete basic repairs in store, with more complicated ones done off site, can offer software support on site and can even arrange exchanges and replacements. If your phone develops a fault that’s covered under warranty, pop into store and they can sort it out. AppleCare takes this a step further. Say you crack your screen and you have AppleCare…..book a slot at your local store, pay a small excess of £29 (correct at time of writing) and they will replace your screen while you wait. If it can’t be repaired, a new device will be given to you. No other manufacturer offers this level of personal support without sending your phone off for repair, especially if you want it to be done by an official repair centre.Value and competition:I am not someone who buys one brand blindly, rather I choose to select each model by its own merits. Android or Apple, I’m open to all. However, at the 13’s price point, I think it’s far better than it’s main competition, which is the Samsung Galaxy S22. It has stronger battery life, better performance, a more premium build, less lenses but better image quality and overall just takes the crown for the middle to upper middle range for the year. I’m very impressed and hope to keep this one for a few years until something really opens my eyes or turns my head.So there’s a touch into the key areas of the iPhone 13. I hope this was useful to you. Take care and enjoy your summer!

Phone is as expected from an iPhone 13. Not much exciting given Apple aren’t really changing things.My frustration is with the exchange service.I submitted an exchange for my old iPhone X and stated the screen was cracked and was informed unless any other issue I would receive £50.I sent the phone in, it was then returned saying I wouldn’t receive the £50 as the screen was cracked.I have no issue with the reason, however do have issue that I communicated it was cracked and bought the new phone on the basis of an exchange.I’m now unable to exchange the phone elsewhere so effectively have lost £50 due to the lack of commitment.I suggest customers should submit pictures for this service to then commit to an exchange rather than wasting my timeVery poor customer service!

iPhones have a quality feel to them. This one is no different.  The screen is larger vs the phone size than my last iPhone (7) but this is due to the removal of the ‘thumb’ button.  I have to say I did prefer the fingerprint to the Face ID. And in the world of masks (which I still have to use at work) I don’t feel it’s as secure.  Battery life is much better, possibly just because it’s a new phone though.  Storage is also much better.  Other than that, if you’ve owned an iPhone it’s much the same.  If you’re an android person then you’ll probably hate it, else you’d have an iPhone already (and vice Versa!)
"
1218,B09G9GFDW6,5,"
My previous phone was an iPhone X and when it finally ceased to work, I invested in an iPhone 13.  It’s only been a couple of weeks since my purchase but battery appears to last longer, camera is excellent !  The processor is faster and the phone is 5G.It’s early days but am very happy.

So far like everything about this phone, first time for an iPhone and am very pleased, read several reviews before deciding which one to go for and this is the one for me.
"
1223,B09G9GFDW6,4,"
To tell you the truth I do miss my android phone and I would have gotten it rather than the iPhone. I simply chose this because of the price it was more affordable than the Samsung S22 ultra, and I couldn’t wait any longer. If you’re an iPhone lover which clearly I’m not you will enjoy this phone

The blue is truly beautiful and the square edges are great compared to the boring round version s one earlier phones.The operating system is archaic but Apple doesn’t care as it makes so much money. I knew about the cinematic effect on video on this but disregarded it as the usual marketing feature that people get sucked into. It It is anything but. The effect is superb and holding the phone is almost like having a gimbalQuality of detail on wide angle is appalling. It’s like a very heavily compressed jpg from the nineties. I was going to have a mini but obviously cannot compare as I didn’t buy both. Happy with this.
"
1227,B09G9GFDW6,5,"
I thought it would be more difficult to get used to the new phone and how it works but it was simple enough to adapt from my old iPhone.
"
1228,B09G9GFDW6,5,"
Although like many ex android users I originally scorned and balked at the idea of paying hundreds of pounds for a phone, I  am now converted. There’s no going back once you’ve got used to the quality of an iPhone. The speed and ease of use is world class and Android can stick it where the sun shines, I’m staying with Apple.
"
1229,B09G9GFDW6,4,"

It irritated me that my iPhone XS was not 5G. I decided to get an iPhone 13 and was glad I did. Not only is the battery life much improved, the display is clearer and brighter, but I get 5G!  The the price was not reduced (I bought it after the iPhone 14 was available) but the Amazon 12 months Interest Free helped soften (the price) shock!

It’s an iPhone it’s the same as every phone, if you complain that of this then don’t upgrade every single year… it’s that simple.Last phone was the XR there are loads of amazing changes between both phone. Battery life is excellent.

An Android user since owning an HTC Hero in 2009, I’ve switched to an iPhone 13.I’d been very happy with a Samsung Galaxy S6 and then S8, both bought around a year after release at much reduced price. This time round, last year’s S21 was still pretty expensive and the reviews were disappointing. The new iPhone 13 got great reviews for its camera, reasonable reviews for battery life and it’s not too big (almost the same as my S8) so I switched!I’ve had it for 3 months and I’m very happy with it. It’s easy to use,very responsive and the camera is great. I especially like that I can access the camera with a single left swipe from the Lock Screen. Battery life is good so far, I’m a light user, so I can get two days of use between charges. Hopefully that’ll continue.
"

I am happy with my buy and good value for money. It is exactly as the product description.

Great value for money at this time of the year considering the 14 has just dropped. Battery so far as well as performance has been great. It's a little bit smaller than expected but none the less still very much worth it.

I decided after many years of Samsung I would try an iPhone again as I had a mac and know it integrates easier. The last iPhone I had was literally 10 years ago so was excited to see how they had progressed. Of course it is very impressive. The camera is amazing and the cinematic mode is mindblowing and of course it’s has loads of amazing features etc but it didn’t take long to start hitting walls where apps were concerned. Stuff that was easy and free and sometimes standard features on my Samsung either didn’t exist or you had to pay for it. Also some usability is not as user friendly as Samsung. I often felt when I was using my Samsung it was like using a laptop. You could browse between pages seamlessly and minimise apps and move between them too. But apple still haven’t been able to manage that. Lots of other stuff like this too. I will probably keep for a year just because I have committed to it now and it might grow on me. However it’s likely I will go back to a Samsung when I can

Upgraded from Oppo Find X2 Pro. Glad I did. Would not go back. Got the 256GB model and happy I did. Would definitely recommend especially if prices drop due to iPhone 14 launch.

Only purchased after my Xs max was stolen, wanted to wait till iPhone 14 but having said that this version is a definite improvement over my previous model super slick better screen although slightly smaller (not being a max) battery lasts a couple of days between charges, I would say I’m a light to medium user I don’t use Facebook or the likes just a few what’s app messages Apple Music safari surfing & checking my share prices & call the wife on the way home.Have always used apple products for ease of use I have no problem being locked into their ecosystem & have no intention of moving to android.Would definitely recommend this model, just make sure you get a good case to protect it the screen repair prices are painful.
"
1245,B09G9GFDW6,4,"
As an Android user who didn’t have an iPhone since iPhone 4, I wanted to give it another go and the iOs is definitely a lot better now. Love the battery life on my iPhone 13. You can go a full day of heavy heavy use easily. One thing I don’t understand is that still to this date you cannot send pictures through bluetooth to another phone that is on Android… you will need to either send through Whatsapp (where you lose quality of the photo) or you will have to use and pay for a service such as Amazon Photos or google photos etc. Other than that it’s a really good phone but I hate those silly limitations such as the one above from Apple.

I decided to make the switch from Android as I was tempted by the excellent camera and premium brand/design.I was a little sad about forfeiting fingerprint ID, 120hz screen & excellent battery life but I need a great camera for work so on balance I went for it.I was disappointed I did. I can't believe a premium phone like this, costing double what my Android did, shipped with a faulty touch screen! It was as if I wasn't touching/tapping it and it was so bad I was intermittently unable to use the phone at all. I literally had to wait, put it down and come back to it, until it was willing to respond. I was okay with the downgrade the other features I mentioned but the touchscreen was kinda essential and therefore a deal-breaker!Thankfully Amazon are arranging a return & refund due the faulty touchscreen. Excellent service there.On the plus side, the photos I took while I had it were excellent as expected and the battery life was noticeably much better than previous iPhones I've used. The AMOLED screen was excellent.I can't comment on the accuracy of Face ID as I was wearing a mask most of the time and had to put my pin in whenever unlocking.If you're coming from an old iPhone you'll love it (if your coming from a nice Android you won't know the difference).
"
1249,B09G9GFDW6,4,"
I avoided previous iPhones due to how little they advance each time since iPhone 4.This one has flat edges which really improve the quality of the phone.
"
1250,B09G9GFDW6,3,"
They don't really tell you the Camera, while good, doesn't have optical zoom. This means any zooming is destructive and horrid. The pro is really the finished product. Thats what I should have got. If you don't take many photos, then it's fine. But nothing that much more special than an 11 or 12.
"
1251,B09G9GFDW6,5,"
Excellent product from Apple but, in my opinion, a little overpriced.  Bought for my wife's birthday and that is what she wanted but I have Samsung.  They are cheaper and just as good.

My note 8 samsung is almost 5 years old and needed a replacement. So went for the iphone 13.Similar priced android phones have a relatively poor battery life and not as impressive camera. There is no telephoto zoom but so far i havent missed it a lot. I like android but have to say im getting fewer malware on ios ( this is my first iphone btw).The camera is stunning.Hope this phone will last another 5 /6 years.

Was initially hesitant on the colour as I thought it would be a little boring but it is really nice. Great size, previously had the XS Max and this was a nice downsize. Takes some stunning photos!
"
1256,B09G9GFDW6,5,"
I love it ones you have a iPhone it’s hard to replace it no regrets here , just the battery I thought that would keep longer , but if you’re watching videos all the time I guess that’s what happens you need to charge twice a day !
"
1257,B09G9GFDW6,3,"
Lovely to look at - and Apple user yet I prefer the central finger control. Often pressing screen over and over, rather than once.  Unclear how Apple justify the price.  Come on Apple - if you’re going to upgrade models do it well.

After my iphone x developed a fault so intermittent it could not be found to be fixed I waited to the release of the iphone 13 as it was only a month away I checked the prices of the iphone 12 and for just £50 extra the obvious winner was the 13 with the new battery capacity I can report battery life is huge and quite often I only use 25%of battery each day and that includes using GPS I honestly now never run low on battery none of that topping up during the day stuff After owning a 4s 5 6s and X this upgrade is the best

I really like the pastel pink and attention to detail  258GB. Very easy to set up feels more responsive than iPhone 12 and finally a sim tray from Apple where SIM card clicks in straight away I have struggled in the past with previous iPhones plus fab price on Amazon £100 cheaper than Apple

Upgraded from an ( iPhone 8 plus)This New iPhone 13 (product red) Looks and feels great!-(CAMERA) The camera quality is outstanding, And the ultra wide lense is an extra bonus when needing to take them Wide angle shots. There is a load of other features on the camera that have yet to be tested.-(Display) - The size is perfect being 6.1‑inch, Making gaming on my phone a possibility if i ever want to do that, It Also makes video viewing perfect, And with the display being almost the entire screen, it Keeps me focused on the video/application, The display is very responsive and just feels much cleaner that my previous 8+- No faults, I have yet to find an issue with this iPhone 13, If i do find myself finding issues with this phone, I'll be sure to edit this review.
"
1268,B09G9GFDW6,4,"
Decent iPhone with good camera (excellent night time photos)Good battery life and charging time.Only criticism is you need to buy a plug for charging - penny pinching by apple considering the cost price hence the deduction of 1 star in overall rating.I purchased the Anker Nano USB C Plug for charging which works well.

Bought an open box deal as a Xmas gift for my daughter. Phone looked ok initially and everything seemed to work except no connection to mobile data so unable to make calls outside of Wi-Fi. Having wasted hours dealing with Amazon, the mobile phone carrier and Apple it transpires the handset has been recorded as lost/stolen so is useless and in effect a paperweight (Apple’s words!!!)I understand an open box deal to mean minor imperfections….not the handset I was sold.So I would be very wary of buying a phone this way as if it has been returned it makes you wonder why. This completely tarnished my daughters Xmas and does not reflect well on Amazon.

Battery life is great 👍, it’s a nice red never had a red phone before, so easy to use and set up, I didn’t get the phone because of the camera I have a camera to take pictures but it’s good to have when you go out, but can’t do too much of that with COVID and the new variant, and it’s 5G I have 5G so thought I would get it, and it’s much lighter than my iPhone 11 so comfortable in my hand, very happy with my new phone

Box arrived opened with thin slice along of the one protective stickers. Don’t know why Amazon sends such products, but it clearly false advertising!UPDATE:Had long chat with Amazon, got to resolution with them and decided to try this one out.Phone itself, as well as cable seemed untouched. And phone is working well.So if not for opened box it would be good.As a result of resolution increasing to 3 stars. Kudos Amazon support.

Sheeple or advocate, I can’t help it, I like apple products. This is no different, an upgrade for my partners phone, an improved camera, almost a revision back to its earlier design, it’s a nice piece of kit.First time I’ve bought a handset from Amazon, having had a high value item go “AWOL” previously I was impressed by the pin delivery where you have to provide the driver with a code to allow them to handover.

I was forced to upgrade from an ageing iPhone 6s because the battery life had completely died, which I am convinced was almost entirely a function of software. Strange how after every update the battery performance deteriorated.The battery life is good. Pretty much everything else is a big step backwards. There is no fingerprint recognition anymore. It's Face ID. Doesn't work with a facemask which we have to wear these days. Doesn't work with my banking app.They got rid of the home button and have otherwise messed around with the OS. I struggle to access basic features now. You need to flick up or down at just the right place in just the right way rather than just pressing a button.They no longer bother to include a charger, so you need to buy that separately. They got rid of the headphone socket. So you can buy bulky bluetooth earbuds with limited battery life, or pay extra for an adapter, which is what I did.I bought an Apple silicone case. It slightly obstructs the lightning socket to the extent my charger cable won't fit. So every day I need to remove the case to charge it and then put it back on in the morning.On paper the specs are doubtless far superior to my 6s. But in practical terms, before they nixed my battery, the 6s did everything I needed with no fuss. This 13 has lost identifiable features: home button, headphone socket, charger, fingerprint scanner - with no compensation.How long before Apple decides I need to buy another phone and forces an OS update on me that nerfs my battery life?

Am I the only one having sound issues? As I’ve not seen other reviews about this. I usually have to put this on loudspeaker and even after I do, most people complain that they can’t hear me or that the sound is cutting out. Outside Amazon reviews, on Google there were some comments about this, so I’m entirely confused if this is particular to my device or others as well. Anyways I have to return it as there is absolutely no significant difference with the 13 from the 12, or 11 as well.

The phone was great and value for money not bad considering trade in value offered for my old iPhone. They rejected the trade-in saying the camera was not working, which is false. I have pictures taken the day before the  old phone was sent off. Beware of Amazon trade inoffers associated with trade ins. Iam receiving the old phone back and will keep as spare.Old phone received back today and camera works fine so they either did not check it or they had no intention of giving a trade in.

Okay I’ve had the phone for a few months now but there is this one scratch on the screen that has come from nowhere and even with apples “scratch resistant screen” it makes no difference. My iPhone 6 (phone before this 13) had scratches on the back but nothing on the screen. It’s really sad and you can’t see it but you know it’s there , then you look for it. Fine it. Then you are sad again

Arrived next day delivery, easy price plan by dd each month. Really pleased with purchase from this seller. The phone itself is fast, wish that Apple had stuck with touch ID though as if I wear makeup or have hair down it often won’t recognise me.Packaged sympathetically to reduce plastic, no charger just the charging usb cable. The box was also well packaged and product was undamaged, carefully delivered by person to person.

what an awful phone, since switching from an old Samsung A40 to an I phone 13 , I have had no end of problems, it rings out when it wants to , the other person might hear me but I hear nothing, it blocks websites even official uk org website so unable to access important services, it is not as accessible to switch from text , phone or email, I hate it , what a waste of money, will never get another, the list is so long it’s too much to list , give me a Samsung anyway , hassle , hassle, hassle.

Purchased this about a month ago . I've used android and Apple products before. Simple to set up, runs smoothly. Beautiful vibrant and bright display . I disabled Auto brightness and the display now goes up to 800 nits brightness in manual mode, much brighter than my previous pixel 6 phone ( I found the pixel 6 display a bit dim and lacking brightness, although a good phone) the iphone 13 also goes up to 1200 nits brightness during certain conditions. The camera is good, on a par with my previous pixel 6, video is even better ! It's quite user friendly, albeit not as easy to use as android, I guess it's just different, but easy to adapt to. It's a tad expensive, but I can feel a difference in quality, as in it feels and functions like a high quality device. It also seems fast and responsive! The 60hz display feels smooth, considering other devices have 120hz displays. Face unlock Is fast and has never failed. I would recommend this product!
"
1349,B09G9GFDW6,5,"
Enjoyed unboxing the phone and couldnt wait too see what the hype was all about. No scratches on the phone and came in perfect condition will definitely be buying one for my son in the near future thank you.

Had to send it back and get another one and the new one is just as terrible! So many faults, this is such a waste of money. The torch turns on whenever it pleases, the screen freezes and apps close in the middle of use. Time to move to android.

1351,B09G9GFDW6,5,"
Bought on the apple website during Black Friday sales.Battery life is brilliant - after 2 days of light use it was around 30%. Charges quite quickly. The screen is nice, and camera is great! This is my first time using an iPhone so still getting used to it, but it’s good so far.The Face ID is a bit weird to me, the phone lights up when you look at it but doesn’t always if you’ve not used it for a little while. I think I would probably still prefer finger print ID, but my friend swears by Face ID so I’m trying to get used to it.

Waste of space, would not connect via usb or cable to my two Imacs and I was unable to reset. A waste of money and time.Very frustrating and Amazon wanted me to contact Apple, not them, which I would not do, I wanted a phone that will work out of the box for this money.

Phone looks nice but is so often getting hot and loses signal which means that I have to turn the phone on and off to get signal back

The design reminds of I phone 4. The resolution is improved comparing to my iPhone 11 but feels more bulky in my palm than I phone 11. It arrived without a charger- ?!!!! Nearly 800 pounds for a new phone to buy additionally a charger - I don’t get it. And here comes the nightmare - the battery last a day if not less moderate use - absolutely disgraceful. I will definitely not recommend this product
"
1357,B09G9GFDW6,1,"
Amazon only offered a repair not a replacement. I have lost confidence in this mobile so I hope they don’t send the mobile back has I would like a brand new phone. Lost trust in that old phone only had this since end of November. Not used till 11 December problems with it since out of the box.
"
1358,B09G9GFDW6,1,"
The phone wouldn't set up or recognise my Apple ID so had to be returned.I bought insurance with it which is a mistake that requires a different conversation direct with Apple.as masssive pain in the A**S all round
"
1359,B09G9GFDW6,1,"
I would have liked to review the iPhone 13 but due to theft/fraud, there wasn’t one in the pare I received. This is a perfectly reasonable review, pointing out that not everything on Amazon is as expected, and the customer service to get my money back s utterly disgraceful.

This way a 60th birthday gift for my husband.  NO CONTRACT.Lovely looking phone. Easy to navigate once you get the hang of it. Fabulous functions.So much better than his android.Very slim so the purchase of an i phone 13 wallet case makes it easier to handle and protects it.Shame mobile companies exploit customers with high charges. Amazon were the best price out there even though still pricey . Well done amazon.

I bought this as my iPhone 7 stopped working and here are the reasons I bought a iPhone 13 over the pro and max.Apple ui looks so much better than android.You don’t need a better camera when it’s almost twice the price in the pro or max.120hz display isn’t worth the extra price.Smaller phone is better to hold and use than the max.128gb is enough storage for most people.ProsIt’s FastFast charging with 20w charger.Great UINice new camerasBigger screenCan connect external storage5GSmaller notchPicture in PictureSplit screen appsConsNo charger given to you.No Matt coloursNo telephotoNo 6x optical zoomNo night mode scanner4 not 5 GPUSmaller battery than the Pro maxNo Touch ID instead you have stupid Face IDNo promotion displayNo 3rd cameraNo pro resSoftware updates only last for 7 yearsBattery will need replacing after 3 yearsNo usb cAlthough I’ve listed the cons I think the iPhone is still the best phone that you can buy and you will use every day but I’d get the standard iPhone 13 because the max and pro are a rip off the price has become to high for very little extra features compared with the standard phone.And like all smart phones there’s nothing much new each year it’s just new software that improves the features so if you can wait another year buy the iPhone 14 which will possibly have the following.USB cTouch idNo notch screenBattery cameras

Recently i upgrade to iPhone 13 pro. I have been using this from 5 days. Battery is something I’m not really convinced with it. This is the first time I had this experience I bought a new product and the batter is not really up to the make. May be it’s because of the 5G. But it is bit disappointing, we can’t live in fear we have turn in dark mode, make changes in location, look for videos on YouTube how save battery. Camera quality, built quickly software easy to use iOS15. That’s my honest review about iPhone 13pro 256gb
"
1370,B09G9GFDW6,1,"
I bought this and had to return it,  main problem, I thought the camera was poor,  not as good as my 2 year old se model,  it struggled to focus on anything close up,  it is already partially zoomed at x1, so that does not help,the wide shot mode is utterly pointless, and make photos look strange,The photos often look false and over processed,I did a test with a photo group I am in,  I posted 2 identical photos, one with my old se model,And one with the iPhone 13,  I did not tell anyone what phones I had taken the photos with,I just asked them to say which was best,Not one person out of a big group, not one chose the I phone 13,Everyone said the iPhone se photo was better, sharper, more natural looking photo.So iPhone 13 is a very expensive downgrade in my opinion, and I was glad to see the back of it,I would not recommend this phone if like me, you use it more as a camera than a phone.It seems Apple have forgotten how to do a good upgrade,Considering how much this phone is,  If it was £400 it would be nearer the Mark, but over £700,It’s a expensive joke.
"
1371,B09G9GFDW6,5,"
Whilst it may be an incremental upgrade over the 12 three key areas have been substantially improved; storage, battery and camera. Face ID still the best. Perfect size - not a slab. It's the overall best phone with a sensibly-sized form factor. The negatives? In an era of 65W charging by the likes Of OnePlus the iPhone charges at a snail's pace - wirelessly it's ridiculously slow. 1200 Htz screen refresh only available on Pro models. Still no USB-C charging. Whilst smaller, the notch is beginning to look ridiculous. No fingerprint reader.

This not my 1st iPhone my last iPhone was 6s before I switch to android  “Samsung” in 2018.Now I switch back to iPhone as I missed iOS in past 3 years.Last time I had 64gb on the iPhone 6s that was not good for me as not much GB so, this time I those 512gb and it is my biggest GB I ever had on my iPhone 13!I love the color pink I never chose pink color before last time I had Space Grey on iPhone 6s I am guy so, why not. Pink color look amazing!The iOS software change in passed 3 year since iOS 11. iOS 15 is really good software I love it.The camera look fab can’t wait to record it for my YouTube Channel!For me I missed iPhone in passed 3 year.Overall Apple did the great jobs. 👍Can’t wait my next iPhone in 2023!

While the phone arrived unlocked and in good condition, my SIM wasn’t working. I contacted my network who advised that the phone had been blacklisted as it had previously been reported as stolen by its original owner. Phone therefore couldn’t be used and had to be returned.

I was thinking of getting the Pro, but couldn’t justify the cost. I moved up from an iPhone X and love this model way better. The screen is so bright and colourful with excellent blacks. It films video in 4K Dolby Vision and is a must have phone for filming interviews or mini documentaries. Having two lenses is enough for me. I’ve blown the footage up and it has clarity as well as great audio, even in noisy environments. I work in media and can’t always carry a big camera around. This is great backup for those situations when my gear isn’t with me.I shot the attached photos in pitch black and was amazed at the results. Portrait photos are astonishing too. Just remember to keep the filter on normal (default). The others aren’t always reliable. You don’t need any post production either and the depth of field (background blur) is brilliant. At this rate there’ll be no need for cameras anymore in the future. Obviously a good camera is better right now, but the output of this iPhone is very usable.When watching movies, the image is sharp and vibrant with amazing sound. Watching movie trailers YouTube is such a different experience now. I can’t believe these tiny speakers are so loud and clear.At this price, there’s no better value and with the processor/gpu power, you can use photo and video editing software with ease. It’s just so powerful. I recommend it to everyone, especially with the crystal clear FaceTime front camera.
"
1376,B09G9GFDW6,5,"
Upgraded my Iphone SE 2020 for this. It's so powerful - great longer battery life and so much faster......By no means cheap, but it feels much more robust in the hand, has twice the storage capacity too at 128GB, and looks amazing. I'm not too fussed about the apparently great camera but I guess that will be nice too! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Image and state of the art gadgets, phones etc have not been a priority in using technology, If it ain’t broken don’t fix it. Well my old phone was broken the screen was turning into a mosaic with shards of glass desperately trying to sneak through the screen cover. It was tired and worn out, so, tine for a new model. I have a sim only contract as I prefer to own my phone & upgrade it if & when I like. Time to venture into the land of Apple iPhones, I have had an iPad for a few years, love the speed of it compared to Android. The iPhone 13 has the same speed & qualities and I am really impressed with it. It is the only phone we use, no landline. The apps are quick to open, the camera is much better quality and the aesthetics are clean and streamlined. It has a bigger screen size than my old phone all the better for us oldies and having arthritis in my hands it is easier to grip the larger size. Transferring files, settings, apps etc was a doddle. Storage capacity much bigger than I am used to. All in all I am delighted with my new phone and hope to be using it for a long while to cone,

This is my first iPhone after years of Android use. iOS is quite different, but it works fine, once you wrap your head around it. The phone itself is excellent. Beautiful to look at and listen to, incidentally. Great camera, fairly lightweight and it feels well made. It definitely lives up to the hype. Clever too that if it’s close to my iPad or MacBook, I can make or receive calls on any of them. A few foibles. You can’t just start typing a name on the phone keypad to bring up a number, Android style, and it took me a while to realise you need to press and hold to move the cursor when you’re editing text like this review. But it’s minor stuff. If you can stomach the price (which was considerably discounted here - thanks, Amazon), then you won’t be disappointed.EDIT: I’ve found a way to speed up dialling my main contacts. You can use shortcuts to build a speed dial menu which you can access via an icon on your Home Screen. Thank-you, YouTube!

Purchased for my father for Xmas.  He could not believe he'd got a new iPhone after having an iPhone 6 forever.  It's classy and I'm told very easy to transfer data and contact details across from an old phone.  One happy dad!

I brought this phone to upgrade from my iPhone 8 , I only needed 128 gig and didn’t need anymore, the pro and pro max didn’t interest me, this iPhone 13 does everything I need it to do, I would definitely recommend it
"
1381,B09G9GFDW6,5,"
Love this phone was an upgrade from my se (2020) so much of an improvement only thing to be aware of is you need a different charger plug to the older iPhones comes with cable but no plug
"
1382,B09G9GFDW6,5,"
Bought the phone as a stop gap as I’d damaged my previous iPhone. Went for 128gb but quickly realised space would be an issue.Phone itself is brilliant, Apple have done a great job. I love the green colour!
"
1383,B09G9GFDW6,5,"
very fast with great screen , so he tells me He is delighted with this phone
"

"
1385,B09G9GFDW6,5,"
Excellent
"
1386,B09G9GFDW6,5,"
Easy to use, battery life lasts me a long time (approximately a day) and fast at running games. This is an amazing phone for the price!

Can this phone make and receive a call? Yes. Like most phones it can. So why have I rated it so badly? First of all the Face ID is a terrible idea and nobody tells you that until you’ve got one. Face ID does not work in horizontal mode so you are forever having to grab the phone and hold it vertically to open the phone after it goes to sleep. It is so annoying. Befits you’d just reach across with your finger. To actually pick it up and look at the phone is nuts. Next. To operate the phone you are for ever trying to remember all the new slide combinations to access things that before were so easy to do. For instance Square crop on photos is no longer available unless you swipe up but only in a certain area. If I could I would throw this phone in the bin and go back to my 6s which was a far better phone. Don’t buy this phone. Apple are washed up. There era is over.

1388,B09G9GFDW6,5,"
That's ever best phone i boutght. This is to fast, 5G works fine, its nice size and not weight. I have choosen the blue one with 128GB, i guess with the 5G and cloud storage its enought. So that's my opinion about.

What can be said that was not said before? A superb product. Fast, top quality, beautiful design... I am very happy with my purchase. Despite considered to move to some Android based phone, after careful thoughts decided to stay with the high-end of mobile telephones...

"
1397,B09G9GFDW6,5,"
I love the colour I got (starlight) and how amazing it is to have a 128gb instead of the pathetic 16gb I had before, I can now download all of my favourite apps and get my music back on, it’s a very good phone one of the best phones I had in a while. I always go for iPhones, it’s what I know, won’t go any other brand! I highly recommend this phone

The iPhone 13 has the same design as last year’s iPhone 12 model, but it's internally where the differences can be found.  One of the key internal changes being an improved camera where Apple have taken last year’s much praised iPhone 12 Pro Max wide camera lens and put it into the iPhone 13... and the images are fantastic!Another key improvement is Apples new A15 bionic chip with a 6 core CPU, 4 core GPU and 4Gb of RAM (in the iPhone 13).  Currently, the A15 Bionic chip is the fastest smartphone chip in the world meaning it can handle the most demanding apps/processes and still has room to spare.It also means Apple will continue to support the iPhone 13 with software (iOS) updates for 5 to 6 years, longer than any other smartphone manufacturer.  so if you are looking for a future proof, then that's what you will be doing by buying this.The battery is also very good.  I'm not a heavy phone user but I've become accustomed to ensuring I have a charger close by 'in case' I need it, whereas with the iPhone 13 I'm comfortably getting through the day without needing to charge it... and on a several occasions into the next day too.The main differences between the iPhone 13 and iPhone Pro, or Pro Max, are:- Graphics:  The iPhone 13 has a 4 core GPU where the Pro has a 5 core GPU- Display:  The iPhone 13 has a 60Hz refresh display where the Pro has ProMotion, an adaptive display which ranges from 10 to 120Hz depending on what you are looking at or doing- Battery:  The iPhone 13 has an estimated 15 hours of continuous streaming and the Pro as 20 hours- Camera:  The iPhone 13 has a Wide Camera lens and an Ultra-Wide camera lens, where the Pro has a Wide, Ultra-Wide and a Telephoto camera lens.The Pro models also have macro photography thanks to a new Ultra-Wide camera lens which take stunning images.Overall, the iPhone 13 is a fantastic phone and ideal for anyone wanting to:a) Upgrade from a phone older than the iPhone 11b) Looking for the most future proof smart phone they can getc) Are not fussed by telephoto or macro photographyLastly, I’ve attached 5 photo examples of Photographic Styles, new feature to the iPhone 13 range.

The phone arrived in a cheap box, looking very chinesey, I then noticed the box was not sealed in any way, I opened the box, the phone was the wrong way round, it's got smudges all over it. REALLY SUSPECT

This review is for the Apple iPhone 13 (128GB) - Starlight.Another amazing phone from Apple. Lovely designed and works great. I upgraded from a iPhone 7+ and there is a world of difference in speed and features! Fantastic and worth every penny. Should keep me going for another 5 years!Update after using for a week: still love it! iOS 15 is great love the additions to the weather app and how you listen to your voicemails. 👍🏻👍🏻2 weeks update.. still going well! So much better than my iPhone 7+

Lovely phone beautiful made in a combined glass mineral and aluminium construction. Easy to use with a lot of thought that has gone into how this works embracing the very best of the latest technology. Very delighted with it. But, after setting it up on the day I received it, it started an update to IOS 15.4.1. The next day it was bricked! I tried hardware resets many times, updates through iTunes over and over and factory resets many many times. In the end I have had to send the phone off to Apple to be repaired. I still think this is a good phone though. And online Apple support is really good. But I can't help feeling disappointed that this can happen.As an update, Apple fixed this very quickly. Very impressed and a great phone! Added a well deserved star because of the superb product supported by a superb service.

Rivedo il mio primo giudizio. Dopo due anni dì pandemia il Face ID è decisamente superato. Meglio un bel Touch ID o un riconoscimento biometrico oculare, per esempio. Anche la tastiera va migliorata. È inaccettabile il continuo swap tra lettere e numeri.Primo commento: Non avrei mai pensato di innamorarmi di un cellulare 😅. È semplicemente perfetto, e il colore è fuori di testa! Spedizione impeccabile come sempre

I ordered a 256gb refurbished 13 pro. The trick is as you navigate through the colours or memory sizes, the refurbishment category keeps changing (excellent-good-fair) and you need to look one final time before placing an order!I got a phone in fair condition, which means dents and scratches which are visible. The side panel shows signs of damage as well.The battery health is 98% and phone is registered with Apple. All features work. So far I am able to get 4G only. So 5G is not tested.Finally, this seller must improve their packaging. When the phone arrived, it had lot of dew all over. A simple thing like a silica gel desiccant could have prevented this. After all, you pay a lot of money for an iPhone 13pro and expect the packaging not to damage it.

A good seller who replies within 1 day.Phones are in quite good condition. Packaging can be improved. Price is very decent. The devices should be cleaned better before they get dispatched to the customers.I got 1 x iphone 13 pro max 256gb ""excellent"" condition which was excellent indeed. 94% battery but I had to spend some time cleaning the edges and cameras of the phone from dirt.I also ordered 1 x iphone 13 pro 256gb accidentally ""excellent condition"". This was not a real excellent since it came with lots of scratches on the screen. the battery life was 99% though.Overall, I recommend the seller since you're backed up by Amazon. He communicates well and he listens to his customers
"
1427,B09MGHBY7J,5,"
great seller, shipped the phone quickly and always responded quickly. The phone is in excellent condition, no scratches, like never used, 98% battery, I am satisfied

My first, comment was not good as they told me the phone would not be here till the 28, and would not give me a refund, but it was delivered on the 24th before Christmas so all great, phone was spot on and a thank you for getting it to me on the right date .

I had already bought a new phone the same for myself, Daughter fell in love with it, so i gave it to her for Xmas and I bought myself the renewed one. Over £200 cheaper, perfect condition 100% battery life. No complaints whatsoever.

As far as reconditioned it looks and works like a brand new item. Box was different but I don’t keep those anyway so who cares

The phone is like new, even it has month or two Apple warranty still, more than happy to have bought it from this seller 🙏
"

Few minor marks on the sides as expected, but great condition for an used phone. More than 90% battery life on this particular device and face recognition works perfectly. Recommend it 👍🏽
"
1435,B09MGHBY7J,5,"
Got mine with 93% battery life and is impeccable. Had it for over a week and didn’t notice anything wrong performance wise - calls, video, speed.I really had to squint to notice any tiny scratches. I’m glad I made myself this gift instead of purchasing a more expensive one on a contract. It came with a new charging cable, so did feel a bit like getting a new phone apart (from the neutral packaging).Now I’m researching how to take better Xmas photos with the iphone13 Pro camera. :)
"

Happy with the delivery speed. I ordered 2 mobiles one 13 pro 512GB & other 1 TB. It arrived 1 day before committed arrival day. The delivery was in sellers box with Trustpilot rating. The parcel consist of mobile and a charging cable(no adapter). The mobile was perfectly packed in a thin transparent sheet. It looks exactly like brand new, no marks, scratches. The device works as expected. Got all useful apps installed successfully.The charging cable for 1 mobile seems faulty and I have contacted seller. Waiting for his revert. Apart from that am still not able to say about battery life. It’s first time my mobile is charged 100% since I got it and while writing this review.Overall happy with the product. I am expecting seller to send me a new charging cable. Will update my post on what seller has to say.

Wasn’t sure what to expect as I’ve never bought a renewed phone before but I have to say I’m impressed! Not a single scratch on the screen or body, battery health is 98% and it even came with a brand new genuine USB apple cable (rather than USB C which would have been annoying as I don’t have USB C plugs). I did notice the little speaker grill at the top of the screen is dirty and needs a clean but apart from that the phone is like new!
"
1444,B09MGHBY7J,3,"
I have just received an iphone 13 Pro. The phone externally looks in great condition but the battery charge is only 16%. It said that it had to be at least 80% when arriving so I hope this is not a problem with the battery.

The conditions and number of scratches were way too far of acceptable. Amazon should not permit this and should put Standards for this type of transactions.

Have only had the phone for just over a week but am very happy with its looks and function
"
1449,B09MGHBY7J,5,"
Although it arrived in a plain cardboard box, this was essentially a new phone, with no marks, scratches or signs of any wear and tear.Upon registering the phone with Apple it came up that the warranty had started in July - so clearly it had been switched on and registered at some point - but otherwise 100% mint conditionWould definitely recommended, as effectively it's saving you £100s on a new phone direct from Amazon or Apple, but maybe just keep an eye on the warranty start/end date - this one was only a couple of months off the full 12, but clearly this may not always be the case...
"

I have used mazuma many times before and had good service. This time, felt very confident buying an expensive but refurbished phone as it was through Amazon via mazuma. I didn’t start using it for 2 weeks but when I did, over the Christmas period it was clearly faulty. The speaker function failed the microphone didn’t work and it constantly turned off on the middle of calls. The seller agreed a return and has now refused a refund saying it works. I am shocked at the appalling customer service. Never again. Straight to apple next time
"

The phone came in musicMagpie box, very protected. They said it will arrive approximately between Aug 1 - 4, but it came few days before - the morning after I ordered it. Does not contain any scratches at all, everything works fine. The phone is literally in perfect condition, like someone only used it for two weeks or so. This was a steal :D

I chose MusicMagpie mainly because of their amazing consistency & good reviews with such a high volume of sales. That was truly inspiring. From the quality of what I received, I’m very pleased. I would have described it as ‘excellent’. As far as the usability of the phone, brilliantly easy when you’ve had 5 previous iPhones. My only slight disappointment was the battery only has 87% remaining. I can’t grumble really as it was only sold as more than 80%.
"
1478,B09MGHBY7J,5,"

At first i was unsure as the guaranteed minimum 80% max battery capacity was too low, I was happy to find it at 100% the phone had no scratches or blemishes or dents or any faults. There was some dust on the phone but that was fixed with a quick wipe. Another thing is that the charger cable was not lightning to usb c but usb a to lightning, not a problem just inconvenient as it is less inefficient than the actual charger you get.If you are on the fence of buying this phone like i was get it because it was an absolute steal for 800 very happy with my purchase.

A good seller who replies within 1 day.Phones are in quite good condition. Packaging can be improved. Price is very decent. The devices should be cleaned better before they get dispatched to the customers.I got 1 x iphone 13 pro max 256gb ""excellent"" condition which was excellent indeed. 94% battery but I had to spend some time cleaning the edges and cameras of the phone from dirt.I also ordered 1 x iphone 13 pro 256gb accidentally ""excellent condition"". This was not a real excellent since it came with lots of scratches on the screen. the battery life was 99% though.Overall, I recommend the seller since you're backed up by Amazon. He communicates well and he listens to his customers

My first, comment was not good as they told me the phone would not be here till the 28, and would not give me a refund, but it was delivered on the 24th before Christmas so all great, phone was spot on and a thank you for getting it to me on the right date .

I had already bought a new phone the same for myself, Daughter fell in love with it, so i gave it to her for Xmas and I bought myself the renewed one. Over £200 cheaper, perfect condition 100% battery life. No complaints whatsoever.

Few minor marks on the sides as expected, but great condition for an used phone. More than 90% battery life on this particular device and face recognition works perfectly. Recommend it 👍🏽

Got mine with 93% battery life and is impeccable. Had it for over a week and didn’t notice anything wrong performance wise - calls, video, speed.I really had to squint to notice any tiny scratches. I’m glad I made myself this gift instead of purchasing a more expensive one on a contract. It came with a new charging cable, so did feel a bit like getting a new phone apart (from the neutral packaging).Now I’m researching how to take better Xmas photos with the iphone13 Pro camera. :)

Happy with the delivery speed. I ordered 2 mobiles one 13 pro 512GB & other 1 TB. It arrived 1 day before committed arrival day. The delivery was in sellers box with Trustpilot rating. The parcel consist of mobile and a charging cable(no adapter). The mobile was perfectly packed in a thin transparent sheet. It looks exactly like brand new, no marks, scratches. The device works as expected. Got all useful apps installed successfully.The charging cable for 1 mobile seems faulty and I have contacted seller. Waiting for his revert. Apart from that am still not able to say about battery life. It’s first time my mobile is charged 100% since I got it and while writing this review.Overall happy with the product. I am expecting seller to send me a new charging cable. Will update my post on what seller has to say.

Wasn’t sure what to expect as I’ve never bought a renewed phone before but I have to say I’m impressed! Not a single scratch on the screen or body, battery health is 98% and it even came with a brand new genuine USB apple cable (rather than USB C which would have been annoying as I don’t have USB C plugs). I did notice the little speaker grill at the top of the screen is dirty and needs a clean but apart from that the phone is like new!
"
1504,B09MGG7P3R,3,"
I have just received an iphone 13 Pro. The phone externally looks in great condition but the battery charge is only 16%. It said that it had to be at least 80% when arriving so I hope this is not a problem with the battery.

Although it arrived in a plain cardboard box, this was essentially a new phone, with no marks, scratches or signs of any wear and tear.Upon registering the phone with Apple it came up that the warranty had started in July - so clearly it had been switched on and registered at some point - but otherwise 100% mint conditionWould definitely recommended, as effectively it's saving you £100s on a new phone direct from Amazon or Apple, but maybe just keep an eye on the warranty start/end date - this one was only a couple of months off the full 12, but clearly this may not always be the case...

Phone is only 6 months old. Not a scratch or defect in sight and 6 months Apple warranty left.Battery health 100% and everything. They even chucked it in a box. I mean literally, there was no protection inside the box but I’ll let them off as the phone came un-damaged.

I have used mazuma many times before and had good service. This time, felt very confident buying an expensive but refurbished phone as it was through Amazon via mazuma. I didn’t start using it for 2 weeks but when I did, over the Christmas period it was clearly faulty. The speaker function failed the microphone didn’t work and it constantly turned off on the middle of calls. The seller agreed a return and has now refused a refund saying it works. I am shocked at the appalling customer service. Never again. Straight to apple next time

The phone came in musicMagpie box, very protected. They said it will arrive approximately between Aug 1 - 4, but it came few days before - the morning after I ordered it. Does not contain any scratches at all, everything works fine. The phone is literally in perfect condition, like someone only used it for two weeks or so. This was a steal :D

I chose MusicMagpie mainly because of their amazing consistency & good reviews with such a high volume of sales. That was truly inspiring. From the quality of what I received, I’m very pleased. I would have described it as ‘excellent’. As far as the usability of the phone, brilliantly easy when you’ve had 5 previous iPhones. My only slight disappointment was the battery only has 87% remaining. I can’t grumble really as it was only sold as more than 80%.

At first i was unsure as the guaranteed minimum 80% max battery capacity was too low, I was happy to find it at 100% the phone had no scratches or blemishes or dents or any faults. There was some dust on the phone but that was fixed with a quick wipe. Another thing is that the charger cable was not lightning to usb c but usb a to lightning, not a problem just inconvenient as it is less inefficient than the actual charger you get.If you are on the fence of buying this phone like i was get it because it was an absolute steal for 800 very happy with my purchase.

I decided (Jan 23) that my old iPhone 6s was nearing the end of its life - Apple have decided to stop software updates for it going forward and my concern, now that I use banking apps, was as much about security as anything else. Amazon had £50 off so I bought an iPhone 14 128GB.Amazon delivered it as described - they send you a secure 6 digit code when it's out for delivery to read back to the driver - worked fine.I swapped my old O2 nano sim - non US iPhone 14s as of writing still come with a physical sim slot. Worked immediately. I used the Quick Start wizard to transfer everything from the old phone (had to restart old phone at the start of the process to get it to work). I was pleasantly surprised how well this worked.I won't repeat the many reviews of the phone as they're well documented but immediately I am impressed with its speed, clarity of display, how well Face ID works, the camera, battery life etc.I suspect I will keep it until Apple stop supporting it (7 years??) so very happy.

I’m a big gamer so the fact that games like Genshin work super well on the 14 is a bonus for me. The adjustments from android hasn’t been that hard, but I’m not use to a lot of stuff. This review is going off having a Google pixel not an iPhone before this though so what others are saying about the phone being a iPhone 11 Pro I dunno much about. All I can say it’s better than my old phone with a clearer screen, and I love how it connects to my iPad (important to me as an digital artist.)Battery is amazing, again big gamer so the fact I only charge my phone every two days, In love with. My old phones would be every night and as it got older twice a day without gaming. The colour is a bonus too, love purple.I would go off about price. I’m using Amazon payments, but a lot of companies charge this much for a phone, and SE is best bet if you don’t want your phone to do fancy stuff. I personally wanted good camera , good screen and, gaming. That’s what I’m paying for. :)One thing I’d like is to move my music across without a pc. Haven’t found a way yet, so I just download both google music and iTunes.

Had to get an upgrade from my IPhone 12. Couldn’t be more happier with this phone as of right now. Had it for 3 months now and is still running greatly. The battery life has surprised very much as I have left it in charge for too long on the occasion and it hasn’t effected the max battery charge at all. The 5g is great, camera is fantastic and the systems work to a good standard. Great product
"
1547,B0BDJHR5DD,5,"
I was due an upgrade from my iPhone 10. And after reading reviews I was unsure if to go for this or iPhone 13 Pro. Glad I went for this. Compared to previous versions this phone is quicker. Battery life is better then previous version of iPhone. Camera quality is good. Overall happy with the purchase. It is a bit on the pricey side. I would recommend it.

This is the first time I've ever been up to date with my iPhone. I started with a 6s when the 8 was out and had a XR when the 12 was introduced. At the time of getting the 6s I didn't really have much use for a mobile but I could see they'd become more useful in the years ahead. And now my wife and I used them for almost everything from shopping to ordering our medications, the list goes on. So I wanted an Apple phone that was up to date knowing it would last me, or maybe outlast me, for years. And I love my 14. My grandson said I should have got the pro max and gone for the bigger screen. But this fits in the back pocket of my jeans perfectly. Its also the quickest iPhone I've ever used. So I love it and can heartily recommend it to anyone who, like me doesn't want a fashion statement but a phone that does all you need it to.

1551,B0BDJHR5DD,4,"
A great phone with long battery life and fab camera. The only ‘fault’ is that the SOSEmergency alarm went off while I was driving over a bridge which had regular bumps, was curved and in the traffic was driven at quite a speed. The phone was resting in a cup holder and so was shaken so much the alarm went off and we received a phone call to see if the emergency services needed to be called. The alarm itself was so loud it made me jump. So now I make sure the phone is safely held down.  Otherwise it’s a brilliant bit of kit.

Wow I love this Iphone, I upgraded from the iPhone 12 for a few reasons, the iPhone 12 is great but the battery life is not the best but it's much improved on the iPhone 14 and I needed a phone with more storage so went for this and so glad I did, setting this phone up ran so smooth and fast and for some reason apps seem to download so much faster on this phone and my signal seems a lot stronger, everything runs really smooth on the phone and it's just the perfect size for me, it's the perfect phone for me that I highly recommend. Very pleased with my purchase and glad I went and  got it, oh and feels nice to use hold and use aswell, not had it long but so far can't fault anything with it.

Don't believe me? see how similar they are on gsmarena.Notice how the iPhone has barely evolved since the 10?You get the original design, 4 style design, the 6 style design and 10 style design. That’s only 4 design styles over the years.I tested this iPhone and found the camera is shockingly bad especially for closeup pics, gets blurry when my old 6s could’ve taken closeup pics easily and they were sharp.the iPhone 14 'pro' is the true iPhone 14 you could say, the next step in the evolution of these iPhones considering the dynamic island feature. Seriously, what was the point of the iPhone 14? It's more pointless production and needless waste of resources.If they really want to release a phone every year the changes need to be significant. 14 looks the same as 13 and before. Notch improved? That’s not enough to warrant a whole new phone. The innovation is so lazy, slow and conservative.Meanwhile, Samsung are now in folding phones territory where I think the trend should go next.Speaking of releases I don’t think it’s necessary to release a phone every year. A phone is a phone. I was using my 6s this year and still was doing the business for me so it’s pointless and a waste of resources to spew out phones every year. How many more phones are they going to churn out every year when its clear the iPhone series is plateauing? Makes me wonder what the iPhone 57,485,007,327 will look like, lol (I dread to imagine a future like that and how many landfills exist of old discarded phones, rotting and destroying habitats, but i digress).And given the current cost of living crisis, who in their right mind can afford an iPhone these days when many of us in the real world are having to make decisions like heating or eating? Apple say its 'only' 800 quid or whatever (charging British consumers more than the americans), as if thats cheap - mate, i can get a smartphone for less than 100 off ebay that can still do the same stuff the 14 can do - calls, pics, music, internet, youtube. Apple is SO out of touch with reality and what people can really afford.Before you react with your emotional responses - no, I'm not a fan of samsung. Or apple. or sony. or microsoft. or google. or amazon. or facebook. or whatever-big-company-entity you can think of.What's the point of this product?
"
1574,B0BDJHR5DD,4,"
This is such a disappointment, it’s marginally better than an iPhone 12 and 13.Is it a good phone? Yes, it’s fabulous.Is it worth buying? Absolutely not.Save up for the pro with the newly designed island, excellent new camera and more powerful processor as the basic 14 is pointless. The 14 max maybe an option if you want something bigger but… overall? A completely underwhelming release, and still no usb-c. Come on apple, sort yourselves out, this is the laziest designed iPhone in years.
"
1575,B0BDJHR5DD,3,"
This is a great phone in almost all respects but coming from a 2016 SE this thing is huge, too wide, too thick. I am over 6 ft with massive paws but find it difficult to use with one hand without the constant risk of dropping it.  I erred for a while whether to get the newest or the 13 mini and assumed as they no longer make the mini it wouldn’t a problem. Well apple, if you are reading this, size matters and after a few weeks I’m slightly regretting my choice.
"
1576,B0BDJHR5DD,2,"
A price hike AND the same processor as last year?! (Yes, I know there is one extra GPU). Thanks, I will pass Apple, and get the 13 when I upgrade.

iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are stripped down iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max's. These are no different than the iPhone 13 from 2021 as the internals are the exact same, all they did was take the A15 Bionic chip out of the 13 Pro/Max and that is literally it. Hence, making it a stripped down, knock-off version of the 13 Pro/Max.iPhone 13 Pro/Max is the better phone and better value for money. It has a 120Hz refresh rate display which makes everything look very smooth and responsive, a much better camera system, better battery life, Stainless Steel build instead of the cheap Aluminium. You have to be a clown to willingly buy the 14 and 14 Plus. iPhone 14 is a rip off version of 13 Pro and 14 Plus is a rip off of 13 Pro Max, while making worse at the same time.Don't waste your money on this trash as it was made to be a quick cash grab from Apple. You'll be able to find a 13 Pro Max 256GB for less than a 14 Plus 256GB.If you don't want the 13 Pro/Max, buy a 13 instead at a discounted price. Just don't be the clown that Apple wants you to be and buy the 14/Plus.BUY THE 13 PRO OR 13 PRO MAX, NOT THIS. DO NOT BUY THE iPHONE 14/14 PLUS

... but at £850+  ?? What's the extra money paying for. I figure, for your basic decent phone, £300 is a rough ballpark. Although I love apple products, typing this on my Mac right now, I don't need to phone someone so bad that I'd pay £850. In fact, I'll just not get this, and won't bother calling anyone. Ever.

Don't even add to cart.The iPhone 14 is literally leftover scraps of the iPhone 13, same specs same everything -Hey, who even wants a 7 inch screen? You might aswell get an iPad or Laptop if you're planning to get a phone BIGGER THAN YOUR HEAD. Period. Don't. The most wasteful £1,000 you can ever spend. Just get an iPhone 13 or below - the safety features even require a subscription? - I am NOT going to pay for a life or death situation, thanks.Please, save yourself and just get a different phone. This is Apple's biggest fail.

The ‌iPhone 14‌'s upgrades over the ‌iPhone 13‌ are questionable. This isn’t an upgrade. It’s literally a repackaged iPhone 13! There are no improvements that make it a worthy purchase. Do yourself a favour. Save £850 by not buying it!

Je suis passe du samsung S22 Ultra que je trouvais trop grand et lourd en main a iphone 14 et je suis très content, oui je sais vous allez dire passer de android à Apple c’est juste pas possible mais détrompez vous moi par exemple en même pas 1 semaine je me suis fait et en venant de android depuis plus de 15 ans donc…niveau batterie je tiens 24h en passant plusieurs heures sur tiktok navigation internet spotify etc et j’ai remarqué un réel gain de plusieurs heures niveau batterie comparé au Samsung S22 ultra aussi en 60hz. J’ai une moyenne de 9h écran allumée en 24h Apple c’est beaucoup amélioré niveau autonomie j’en suis très content je le recommande a 1000%, il est ni petit ni grand juste parfait, charge via câble 1h40 ok vous allez dire c’est long il y a mieux mais voila je tiens 24h et il me reste minimum 20% de batterie donc je suis tranquille. J’espère avoir aidé car moi j’ai beaucoup hésité venant de android mais j’en suis vraiment pas déçu j’en suis même très très content voila voila

Quel beau téléphone !Passer d'un vieux Samsung a un Iphone 14, c'est un grand pas !Tout est intuitif, simple, limpide .Etant déjà familiarisé avec Apple je dois dire que c'est un pur bonheur.La qualité de l'écran est dingue !C'est un sacré budget, mais vraiment rentabilisé !

Bin seit dem Note 7 Desaster auf Apple umgestiegen und muss sagen möchte es nicht mehr missen.Was mir persönlich beim Iphone gefällt ist das schlichte aber edle Design. Sieht qualitativ wertig aus und fühlt sich auch so an. Was mir noch gefällt ist der lange Software Support.

Wechsel nach viiiiiiieeeelen Jahren vom iPhone 6 auf 14 - alles stimmig! Allerdings wurde die doch etwas hochwertige Sendungen gegen Mittag geliefert, und da ich noch auf Arbeit ( wie sollte ich sowas denn bezahlen🧐) In Unserem Mehrfamilienhaus, Handwerker waren auch noch da. . . einfach auf die Briefkästen gestellt🤔 Zum Glück war das Paket noch da! 😇 Alles komplett und wohlbehalten.

Sicherlich gut für die nächsten 3 Jahre, Entscheidung fiel auf genau dieses Modell weil Netto-Tagespreis unter 800,- und deswegen als GWG abzuschreiben.Ansonsten von Apple gewohnt gute Haptik, Funktionalität, man hat es in der Hand und fühlt sich vertraut.

Die Kritik, dass sich so wenig zum Vorgänger getan hat kann ich nicht so ganz nachvollziehen. Ich kaufe mir doch auch kein neues Auto, wenn es Facelift ansteht, sondern warte auf den direkten Nachfolger. Das iPhone 14 ist Modellpflege vom 12er und 13er was man auch direkt am Aussehen erkennen kann. Ich bin vom 11er auf das 14er gesprungen und merke schon deutliche Unterschiede.+ super Verarbeitung+ edles Design ohne spürbare Kanten oder Spalte+ Display ist sehr gut verarbeitet und hell+ das iOS. Das Herzstück wie immer DER Kaufgrund für ein iPhone. Ich habe neben diverser Apple Geräte so ziemlich alle Betriebsysteme der letzten Jahre und Hersteller durch. Daher will ich auch keine Grundsatzdiskussion vom Zaun brechen. Für mich ist Apples System die Speerspitze.  Wenn man nun noch mehrere Geräte aus dem Apple Universum benutzt steigert sich das Ganze sogar noch und man hat ein Biotop was genialer nicht sein kann.+ Kamera und die neuen Videofunktionen sind sehr gut. Wer hier kritisiert, dass Apple keine 60 oder 120MP hat dem sei gesagt: Schaut euch die BIlder im Vergleich an. Mehr Pixel heißt nicht besser! Aber mit irgendetwas muss man ja punkten, wenn es schon nicht das Betriebsystem ist+ der Transfer der Daten vom alten Telefon zum neuen Gerät. Wie immer simpel, schnell und genial einfach- Preis

Dieses Gerät ist für Leute, die ein sehr sehr hochwertiges Handy haben wollen genau das richtige. Das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis ist zwar fraglich, aber man bekommt eben ein extrem hochwertiges Gerät. Für ältere Personen ist dieses Smartphone eher gewöhnungsbedürftig und nicht zu empfehlen, da die Bedienung über wischen und streichen erfolgt. Für Leute, die jedoch damit gut umgehen können, ist das Handy perfekt. Auch die Kamera geht fast nicht besser. Alles in allem ein perfektes Produkt zu einem etwas teuren Preis, aber wer Apple kauft und damit ein sehr hochwertiges Gerät bekommen möchte, muss eben auch mit so einem Preis leben.

Bin vom 12er auf das iPhone 14 in Product-Red umgestiegen weil ich für  mich persönlich einen - wenn auch geringen - Mehrwert gesehen habe, der mir die 999 Euro einfach wert war. Allein schon die Verdoppelung des Einstiges-Speicherplatzes von immer knappen 64 auf für mich üppige 128 GB war mir den Aufpreis wert. Auch die wesentlich verbesserte Reparaturfreundlichkeit (bin diesbezüglich leider ein gebranntes Kind) ist sehr schön, da sich die Glas-Rückwand nun einzeln und rel. günstig austauschen lässt. Das geht bei den teuren Pro-Modellen leider nicht! Erstaunt war ich auch, wie gut ich mein altes iPhone 12 noch verkaufen konnte - das ist für mich ein grundsätzlicher und nicht zu unterschätzender Vorteil der Apple-Handys. Von mir deshalb volle 5 Sterne!

Allover the iphone 14 is good but there is no major change in iphone 14 and iphone 13. If the price isnot an issue then 14 is good but with 100 euro less one can get same feature in iphone 13.

Nach über 20 Jahre Android, auf Empfehlung umgestiegen auf IPhone 14, das war aber dann doch nicht das gelbe vom Ei!alles nicht so Optimal wie man das gewohnt ist, kein Fingerscann dafür Gesichtserkennung aber nur für eine Person was sehr schlecht ist.Die meisten App von Android gibt es auch im Apple Store allerdings bei Android Kostenlos bei Apple  nur ein paar Tage zum Testen dann muss man Zahlen.Bedienung sehr Kompliziert, man kommt sich vor wie bei einer Putzkolonne wischen schieben, es fehlt das waschen!Ladebuchse immer noch Apple eigen, man hat noch nichts gehört von USB C, habe ich bei meinem Android schon seid 3 Jahren.Und nun soll man dafür soviel Geld bezahlen  für was, für den Glauben es wäre etwas besseres, nein Danke.Ist schon auf dem Wege zurück!!!
"
1656,B0BDJHR5DD,2,"
Ist ja bei Apple nichts neues aber hier merkt man wirklich null Unterschied zu älteren Modellen. Habe nachdem mein 12er kaputt gegangen ist das hier gekauft und es ist schon ziemlich dreist: man merkt wirklich Null Unterschied in der Handhabung und die Kamera ist auch nicht bemerkbar besser. Ganz im Gegenteil sogar, mit dem neuen ios habe ich viel mehr bugs und Aufhänger, dee Akku scheint auch kürzer zu halten. Im großen und ganzen ist es ein super Handy (ios>android), wenn man so viel Geld für ein Hand ausgeben will ok, ich würde aber eher ein älteres Modell kaufen.

The phone was in perfect condition! Really something to change your opinion on refurbished devices.I was particularly fond of the packaging! Thought was clearly put into waste and the came with a charging cable and plug (not original, but no way a problem at all).The battery ‘health’ was at 100% which was incredible to see, so not sure if this was changed, or whether the phone was very new (certainly looked it).FaceRecognition wise I have yet to try, will update if any issues! (Thought I very much doubt it with the way it came).Only problem, is I’d knock £100-200 off the price, because, well, why not ;) , but in all seriousness, perfect condition and happy so far!
"
1670,B09MGFYFZP,4,"
A good seller who replies within 1 day.Phones are in quite good condition. Packaging can be improved. Price is very decent. The devices should be cleaned better before they get dispatched to the customers.I got 1 x iphone 13 pro max 256gb ""excellent"" condition which was excellent indeed. 94% battery but I had to spend some time cleaning the edges and cameras of the phone from dirt.I also ordered 1 x iphone 13 pro 256gb accidentally ""excellent condition"". This was not a real excellent since it came with lots of scratches on the screen. the battery life was 99% though.Overall, I recommend the seller since you're backed up by Amazon. He communicates well and he listens to his customers
"
1671,B09MGFYFZP,4,"
The phone arrived with no damage to the outside which is to be expected as I ordered it in “excellent condition” it seems to be working well no problems noticed yet, only had it for over a week, battery life was 91% which is what disappointed me the most as I would expect higher for this condition.
"
1672,B09MGFYFZP,5,"
Looks like new, works like new. Genuinely can’t see a single scratch. Battery life is still at 97% which is grand. Arrived early, cameras and Face ID all work. Screen is likely the original as True Tone still works. You just need to have a paper clip handy to get the sim tray open because it doesn’t come with the original packaging (pretty standard for refurbished phones in my experience). Great phone, should last well!

The phone is literally like a brand new phone. There is 1 tiny scratch on the screen which you cannot notice unless you try to look for it and the battery life is fantastic. The battery health is 98% which is practically new. Would highly recommend buying this over a brand new phone as you get more or less a new phone for much cheaper price

I had this phone for nearly a month and most of my friends were complaining about sound quality . I actually thought that they might not have good signal because of the wind , but it was poorly for Wi-Fi too. Kind of feeling bad for blaming their devices for the fault.It is cutting through phrases and freeze on video call. FaceTime is glitching and it is not from iOS because I have another 12 pro max which has no issues.I requested to return the item, but this is a small inconvenience. The rest of the phone is great, but if you can’t talk to the phone it is a BIG issue.

I have upgraded my iPhone 11 Pro Max to the 13 Pro Max.If you’re debating going for the new 14 Plus, I would instead look into purchasing a renewed 13 Pro Max. Not only do both phones have most of the same features, the 13 Pro Max also has ProMotion 120hz display which is an extremely noticeable difference moving from the 11 Pro Max.People will most certainly have different experiences buying a renewed phone, however I received mine in almost pristine condition (only a slight hair line scratch at the bottom of the screen, only visible in certain angles), the battery is at 99% health which is basically a new phone.All in all I would recommend going for a renewed phone if you’re looking so save the extra £££ and still receive the latest features.

Iphones hot spot is complete and utter garbage and I'm not the only one that's noticed. I used to use my 10yr old Samsung S8s hotspot for everything. It wasn't even 5g enabled. It was consistent, devices connected automatically and there was no problems. After switching to iPhone I never thought I'd be stepping back 15 yrs. I now effectively do not have a hot spot. Devices do not connect automatically (Even my Mac which connects without fail to my old android) if devices do connect they regularly disconnect and or just stop working. I had never seen the exclamation mark symbol on the wifi status bar on Mac until I regrettably switched to iPhone. iPhone doesn't even let you go in and see what is connected to the hot spot either, you just have to guess. The way you have to make the hotspot discoverable is ridiculous too, you need to leave it on the settings screen, but if you're using an app like trying to get an Alexa or a smart watch connected you have to come off it, so its no longer discoverable. I had to use my android to connect my Alexa to my iPhone. Just ridiculous, no option to make hot spot permanently discoverable but I suppose it's neither here nor there because it often doesn't work anyway! I write this review on my Mac with my iPhone plugged in via USB and wifi off because surprise surprise, the hot spot isn't working. Please note I've wasted countless hours on resetting network settings and trying this that and the other thing. The problem is it's an iPhone and iPhones have absolutely garbage connectivity and no amount of resetting or changing settings will change that. There is countless online threads on iPhones non existent hotspot, some of which go back years. it's 2023 and iPhone still acts like it's 2004 and tethering doesn't yet exist. Will be changing back to android asap

I purchased the refurbished iphone 13 pro max, and i cannot lie, i could not point out a single flaw.

Bought this phone to replace thad the previous phone had a smaller memory and I bought this one because it’s a 1tb, since I had it I realise I have been losing signal phone would just loose connective even when it’s says 5g I have 1 bar my family would call me and they can’t get through it would go straight to voicemail, I’ve also notice even the phone is connected to my home Wi-Fi I would still get error message coming up saying unstable connection, I did request a return but haven’t but I couldn’t return the phone as I didn’t have another phone to replace it with and now Amazon and the seller won’t do anything regarding the phone I have emailed Amazon and sent pictures and I still have a. Phone that don’t work properly, I need to keep in communications because I have a child and I case of emergency they can reach me now I’m stuck with a faulty phone

I have upgraded from iPhone 12 Pro and what a difference!+ 120Hz ProMotion display is buttery smooth and superb;+ battery life is exceptional (lasts all day easily with a very heavy use!);+ A15 is a power monster of a processor and nothing can hold it back;+ 6GB of RAM is more than enough and iOS runs like a rocket;+ very premium feel and perfect finish, which as always is expected from Apple;My main 2 reason for upgrading was superb battery life (compared to 12 Pro)and 120Hz high refresh rate display. Those 2 reasons are big enough reasonsand massive improvements that a phone is worth upgrading to!
"
1721,B09MGFYFZP,4,"
I initially was going to return the phone as there was a very visible scratch on the screen. I changed my mind as it is a reconditioned phone. I purchased a screen protector and all at the moment is good. The phone itself is easy to use and a little bigger than I am used to but I am pleased.

I wanted to buy the iPhone 14 pro max but it was out of stock at the time, this phone was my second choice and I’m honestly glad I bought it. Despite lacking a few of the flagship features found in the 14 pro,(such as a 120 hertz display, a few camera upgrades and the dynamic island) it still punches above its weight it terms of quality. After looking at the specifications of this phone and comparing it to the pro model, there are far more similarities than differences. The camera is still spectacular and apart from the macro lens, you would struggle to see the differences in pictures taken with both phones. To summarise, it’s a great phone that’s worth the money
"
1740,B0BDJ9Y7HP,5,"
Apple return to making a large version of their normal handset for the first time since the 8 plus and what a brilliant bit of kit it is.I find the cameras on a standard iPhone superb and more than good enough for my needs. For the iPhone 12 & 13 I’ve had to get the Pro Max to get the larger screen.Don’t get me wrong, the pro max is a great phone but unless you’re a serious photographer it’s likely the camera’s never going to reach its potential with the average user.Being able to buy the 256GB version of the standard iPhone for more or less the price of the 128GB pro Max is a real yes please moment.As an avid product red buyer I’m also delighted to be able to go back to red. The Pro Max has never been available in any of the colours I like so I’ve always hidden it in a case.The iPhone 14 Plus is fast, the battery life a massive improvement, the cameras are excellent and the price point, whilst expensive, offers the average user more for their money.
"
1741,B0BDJ9Y7HP,5,"
Purchased the new iPhone 14 after getting fed up with my old iPhone 6s for a year or so?This is great technology and although it was expensive, Amazon at least gave me 5% off. Could not get anything as trade-in from Apple, so this was a bonus. Changing over to the new iPhone is now very easy.
"
1742,B0BDJ9Y7HP,5,"
I never had a plus iPhone and I didn't want to spend that much money to get the Pro Max, so this iPhone 14 plus was perfect, the size of the phone and the battery are great.

After a couple of months, without hesitation, this is just a great phone and red colour/finish is gorgeous

1747,B0BDJ9Y7HP,5,"
I love this phone. I've never had an iPhone so from my perspective this item is insanely good.The screen is large, battery lasts long and the camera is extremely good (it supersedes what I had on my previous phones). It's expensive but worth the money.However, from what I understood, the refresh frame on the screen on the Plus version is a bit lower than the Pro. So perhaps if you are picky when it comes to iphones, look into that because it might bother you. It doesnt bother me at all (due to my previous phone being total garbo).5/5 stars! Love it :)

Not much change from the 13 series but I come from series 11. It’s a huge leap. Amazing camera. Very fast. Clear screen. Amazing camera. Brilliant operating system. Crash detection on this model. Get at least 256gb one as you’ll need it. You will need to pay iCloud storage too as 5gb free isn’t enough.

The iPhone 14 Plus is extremely bad value. Apart from a slightly larger screen, there are no standout features that make this superior than last years iPhone 13. Even worse, if you pay a little bit more, you can get the flagship iPhone 14 Pro! My biggest question is who did Apple make this for?!

J’ai mis 2 mois à me décider, entre choisir un iPhone 14 , 14 plus ou 13 pro max … désirant un écran assez grand le choix c’est donc fait entre la qualité photo du 13 pro max et la légèreté et l’autonomie du 14 plus . Perso mon utilité personnelle se contente de l’objectif du 14 plus ( et il est déjà pas mal !) question autonomie croyez le ou non le 14 plus me fait 48 h voir plus ! ( jeux , réseaux , Visio …) le 13 pro max pour la même utilité fait un peu moins de 48h (testé) . J’ai donc opté pour le 14 plus et j’en suis ravi, le prix reste élevé mais justifié pour un iPhone de ce genre

Migrating from a iPhone 7 plus after long five years, where the single complaint was battery life, I decided for an upgrade. No charger was provided, but at the end, I've accumulated so many, that this was really not an issue. But a USB-C cable was provided, which is a good help for faster charging. Migrating Apps and settings was really the best experience I had: By starting the new Phone I've had the option for migration, which required just a confirmation on my old device. Passwords were ""automagically"" transferred and in less than one hour everything landed on the new device. Everything was working, including Apple CarPlay and other Apple stuff. Third party Apps were almost Ok, except for very special cases like Bank Account Apps and Authenticators.Other concern was FaceID, since the previous used the fingerprint sensor, but this also worked like a charm, after following the configuration wizard.

1765,B0BDJ9Y7HP,5,"
Certes l’iPhone et iOS sont une combinaison parfaite. L’écran est très agréable pour naviguer, visionner des vidéos, jouer. Une finition et des matériaux de bonnes factures. Un poids contenu malgré sa taille. Mais le prix, le prix… cher pour une appareil qui ne profite que d’un écran plus grand et recycle le processeur de la génération précédente. Rien de nouveau pour le reste, si vous désirez rester au format plus compact, alors prenez un iPhone 13, le 14 ne vous apportera rien de plus, enfin si, une facture plus salée.

1766,B0BDJ9Y7HP,5,"
Super schnelle Lieferung und Abwicklung. Beim starten hat er zwar ein Update verlangt, aber war nicht schlimm. Ich kann im allgemeinen noch nicht viel darüber sagen, da ich es noch komplett einrichten muss und mir ein Panzerglas drauf machen lassen möchte. Es ist schon recht groß im Gegensatz zum alten und schwerer. Aber man wusste ja die Größe des Handys laut Hersteller. Wie es sich im Alltag bewährt, wird sich raus stellen. Ich muss es jetzt in Ruhe einrichten. Farbe finde ich okay. Vielleicht in ein paar Monaten mehr.

Bin vom Iphone 12 umgestiegen da ich, ende fünfzig, einfach ein wenig größere Buchstaben brauche (scheiß Altersweitsichtigkeit). Ich bin äußerst zufrieden mit dem Wechsel, whatsapp, Zeitung, Email  etc. sind jetzt (zur Not) auch ohne Lesebrille lesbar. Das Pro max war mir schlicht zu teuer, dessen sicher super Kamera wäre für meine Bedürfnisse überzogen, die Kamera des ""normalen"" 14/14 plus ist schon super für mich. Ob 60 hz oder 120 hz Anzeige ist mir egal, ich bin kein Gamer. Alles in Allem ein tolles, großes Telefon mit dem man für die nächsten Jahre bedient sein wird.  Ansonsten ist es natürlich unübertroffen wie Apple alles zu einen Ökosystem zusammengeführt hat, Iphone, Ipad, Iwatch und Apple TV harmonieren perfekt zusammen, ohne das übliche Geärgere wie bei Android üblich sobald es um mehr als ein Gerät geht.Update nach ein paar Tagen Nutzung im Vergleich zum iPhone pro max meiner Freundin: was sofort auffällt ist dass das Pro deutlich schwerer ist, meiner Freundin ist es egal, deren Handy ist in der Handtasche die eh ungefähr 2 kg Kram enthält, ich habe das Handy in der Jacke, da ist mir das leichte Plus deutlich lieber. Der zweite große Unterschied ist der Akku, das Plus schafft bei mir fast zwei Tage, das Pro nur gut einen.Ich bin auch nach dem Vergleich sehr zufrieden mit der Entscheidung für das Plus und gegen das Pro

La qualité du téléphone, photo , batterie n’a rien avoir ! Je suis ravie de mon achat et je recommande à 1000%

Ich bin sehr zufrieden mit dem Smartphone. Dass es sich hierbei nicht um das 120 Hz Display handelt, fällt eigentlich nicht auf. Nur wenn man es mit diesem vergleicht, im normalen Gebrauch merkt man es nicht außer vielleicht beim Spielen eines Spiels. Ansonsten ist es wirklich sehr gut in der Verwendung, der Akku hält wirklich lange und auch die Kamera macht gute Fotos.Insgesamt finde ich das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis deutlich besser gegenüber den pro Varianten.

Le téléphone est arrivé sans problème via le transporteur, un code est demandé pour garantir la livraison et la boîte est scellée.Je dirai juste que j'ai été surpris de ne pas trouver d'écouteur filaires, pour un tel prix ce serait le minimum sachant qu'Apple fait déjà pas mal d'économie sur le chargeur qui n'est pas fourni non plus.Il n'y a pas non plus de coque ni de protège écran...Le contenu de la boîte se résume au téléphone et au câble usb-c vers lightning. Pour un tel prix on pourrait s'attendre au minimum à avoir un protège écran basique et une coque, le temps d'acheter le nécessaire pour faire mieux.

Wie immer bei Apple, ein top gerät. Die preispolitik bezüglich des speichers ist zwar fragwürdig mit ca 400€ differenz zwischen 128GB und 1TB. Aber mir persönlich reichen 128GB in dem fall. Es ist kein schnäpchen und die arbeitsumstände sollen ja auch nicht die besten sein, doch das müssen die verantwortlichen in den griff bekommen.Im vergleich zu android läuft beim iphone alles flüssig und das gefällt mir.Wer auf ein paar spielereien wie die kameranotch und die kamera pro funktionen verzichten kann aber trotzdem die größe des pro max möchte macht hier nichts falsch. Wenns vom geld her geht. In schulden sollte sich keiner wegen einem smartphone stürzen nur um mithalten zu können. Auch sollte man vielleicht vorher das smartphone mal in der hand haben und das normale mit dem plus vergleichen. Das normale liegt top in der hand, das plus erfordert schon öfters mal beide hände. Somit könnte man sich eventuell paar hundert euro sparen und das normale mit 6,1 zoll nehmen. Es ist auf jedenfall ein unterschied der sich auch in der hosentasche bemerkbar macht.

I've ordered a number of renewed iPhones. They are brilliant. By and large they are as described. But I've had a couple of issues. They just take them back, no quibbles, no issues, and issue a refund. So there's no risk.The first iPhone 12 we received had a column of defective pixels. Went straight back. The next arrived and in absolute mint condition, not a mark in sight, everything working as new, with a 92% battery health. Perfect.Seriously worth buying these considering the savings you make.

I decided to return phone and get a more up to date one. That said the phone was excellent. I didn’t have it long enough to judge battery life etc. My money was returned promptly. I am very pleased and would buy from them again.
"
1819,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
I’ve never bought a refurbished phone before but will definitely do so again. The phone is in pristine condition with 98% battery health. Really pleased with this purchase
"
1820,B08PCCJP5C,4,"
As new condition, great battery life and no problems with the phone. Very pleased.
"
1821,B08PCCJP5C,4,"
Battery life not much better than my old iphone7
"
1822,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Excellent quality, delivered quickly. Very happy with my purchase
"
1823,B08PCCJP5C,4,"
I bought a phone in excellent condition.  Back on the screen is scratched, which is very visible.  Front Screen without scratches.  The battery is 87%, which disappointed me a lot.  Also, the phone came without a charger and in the tiny box it looks like a letter.
"
1824,B08PCCJP5C,4,"
I bought this as a second phone for travelling and I almost can’t fault it. Perfect condition (true to description) no scratches, nicks, nothing at all so very happy about that. Everything seems perfect with it functionally so far and I’ll edit this if anything changes. Only thing is it seems like the battery dies faster than it should. It has 86% battery health but if I’m actively using it, it dies fast than my 80% XR. Not a drastic difference but noticeable. Still very good value for money!
"
1825,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
I was a bit sceptical when ordering a renewed phone but I have been very pleased with my purchase and would have no hesitation in recommending, the phone was advertised as excellent condition but I can honestly say it looks brand new.
"
1826,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Was umming and arring about buying a renewed phone online when you can’t see it beforehand but I decided to take a punt and see what happens and I’m glad I did. Phone was in mint condition no scratches or damage to the body or screen at all. Battery was 89% but that’s more than enough considering the price. If your debating buying I’d say it’s worth whatever risk is involved and if your not happy with the condition you can always send it back.
"
1827,B08PCCJP5C,3,"
So I paid £397 for a iPhone 12 in “excellent “ condition. I must admit I was a little nervous buying a second hand phone unseen as I had never done it before but it is a Christmas present for my son so went ahead. When I received it there is a very obvious long scratch down the centre of the face and several smaller scratches on face of phone. The battery life is 87%. I was going to return it but at this time of year did not want the hassle. I would not buy this kind of purchase online again I’m afraid. I took it into our local mobile shop who concurred it was not “excellent”
"
1828,B08PCCJP5C,4,"
Phone arrived quickly and was as described. However no charging lead and plug suitable for the phone (they had included a Samsung charger but we had purchased an iphone). Contacted amazon as was an amazon renewed product and they passed me to a 3rd party. I expect amazon to deal with amazon renewed product issues but alas not. 3rd party was pleasant and resolved issue quickly. Overall did take shine off the purchase somewhat though.
"
1829,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Received phone and it was like new. Really pleased with it
"
1830,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Seller is active and very happy to help with any issues. The mobile i received had a little fault, but it was expected from a used iphone.  Seller was happy to refund /replace for another one. Great customer service.
"
1831,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
As described excellent condition and quick delivery
"
1832,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
like new condition, battery 88% health
"
1833,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Came exactly as they described excellent condition. Also came well packaged very pleased
"
1834,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Amazing product prompt delivery and made my daughters Christmas thoroughly recommend :)
"
1835,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
The phone is for my husband for Christmas it is an upgrade from his iPhone 7
"
1836,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Ordered my Iphone 12 on Tuesday afternoon and crossed my fingers that the phone that arrived would be in good condition. Delivered on Wednesday evening and I can honestly say it's no different to a brand new Iphone. Not a mark on it and the battery health is at 90%To say I'm pleased with my purchase is and understatement. When you can get Iphones as pristine as this it makes no sense to pay near to or over £1000.00 for a new one!!I have no hesitation is recommending going down this route to anyone who, like me, wants a new phone but not the costs associated.Brilliant service!!
"
1837,B08PCCJP5C,4,"
Battery life disappointing at 83% but phone overall pretty good.
"
1838,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Thank you so much guys, this phone is for a christmas present for my son and i am so happy that it looks so perfect
"
1839,B08PCCJP5C,4,"
I bought my device from the Mazuma mobile. It came in a generic box with a generic usb-a cable and needle. No papers or original accessories. Device was functional.There were 2 issues with the device but they helped me for both:- The item was not the same as the description (there were some scratches). After my complaint, they ordered a small refund.- 2 months later, the phone's IMEI blacklisted and cellular network stopped. After my complaint, they said the issue is related with the previous customer of the phone. Reportedly they contacted with previous customer and blacklist removed.So, customer service was responsive. However, you should check everything and be a conscious customer.
"
1840,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Can’t comment on battery life not had it long enough but I am sure it will be fine
"
1841,B08PCCJP5C,5,
1842,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Excellent condition just like brand new but cheaper price. Won’t ever buy new phone again
"
1843,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
The product was good enough as described in the specifications, maybe the cable could do better with a micro usb, but more importantly the phone is doing great, cheers :)
"
1844,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
I had used iPhones since they were first released and loved them from day one. Last year I purchased a Samsung (great phones) but I never mastered the little differences in OS so took a chance on a refurbed iPhone 12. Best thing I've purchased in a while purchased via Amazon, came next day fab condition, couldn't fault it and I'm forensic. Great deal too boot.
"
1845,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Very cheap with vouchers
"
1846,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Great phone
"
1847,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Very pleased with my refurbished iPhone 12 was like new
"
1848,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
My phone is not working
"
1849,B08PCCJP5C,4,"
Overall a good quality other than a few scratches on the screen and the side’ overall a good product and  Would buy Buy another one if needed.could send in better packaging.
"
1850,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Arrived next working day. Packed really well. No scratches or marks. Looks pristine but only 88% battery life, I had hoped for more. Otherwise really pleased and pretty good value for money. Big improvement on my iPhone 6.
"
1851,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Brilliant could have been brand new
"
1852,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Great phone, good sized screen
"
1853,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Was packaged very well and in excellent condition.
"
1854,B08PCCJP5C,2,"
Phone looks great, came in what I thought was really good condition.Only use phone mostly for messaging partner and Google maps.Came to realise that the camera is useless. Can’t zoom in on anything very blurry. Doesn’t seem to focus properly, so can’t use video either.Not very impressed, wish I’d bought new.
"
1855,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Was scared it would be bad quality but it’s very good!!
"
1856,B08PCCJP5C,3,"
Phone arrived quickly but it had no fragile markers on the package and had been pushed through the letterbox onto a stone floor. Fortunately it didn't break.There are a lot of scratches on the screen for a product described in 'as new' condition, and a few chips to the body. The charge cable supplied is not Apple so time will tell how long it lasts. 88% battery health is a little lower than I'd have liked, though it shouldn't be an issue. The phone was not supplied in its original box and did not include any instructions or other information that would normally be supplied with a new phone. Otherwise the phone is fully functional and as desired.The voucher was a nice surprise too!
"
1857,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Item as described, no marks etc, good battery life.
"
1858,B08PCCJP5C,3,"
I know it’s a rendition phone but there were problems with it like the screen had a orange tinge on the side and when starting up there was a yellow bar across the top of the screen. That would have bugged me.
"
1859,B08PCCJP5C,4,"
This phone is lighter than my previous XR model, face recognition pretty good. Battery time is still a bit of downer for me as it runs out quick. Cable that came with it, was not particularly great as it is already broken. Overall a great phone, great specs , camera brilliant. Love this mint green colour.
"
1860,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Great product, value for money, nothing wrong with it, delivered really quickly too.
"
1861,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Is excellent Ian very happy
"
1862,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
iPhone 12 exactly as described. Had no scratches and everything worked as new. 98% battery health is really good. To my surprise I like the notch and haven’t missed Touch ID at all. Face ID works well.I preferred the telephoto and standard aspect on the iPhone 8 Plus to the normal and wide on this phone but the image quality is a step up again.I think my Apple Watch drains more quickly with this phone than the 8 Plus, but I do have an original Apple Watch, so that’s probably why.The box from loop mobile protected it well and had everything I needed in it. It may not be an original Apple box, but apart from the initial opening of it when does it matter?Arrived earlier than it said it would, I would look to order from Loop again, maybe a newer Apple Watch…
"
1863,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Just as good as new, no problems
"
1864,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Fantastic phone , looks brand new . A great purchase . Love it !!
"
1865,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Phone arrived early and packaged well not a scratch in sight looks like new really happy great job would recommend to anyone.
"
1866,B08PCCJP5C,4,"
My title says it all, how can a business be so unprofessional? There was no original box just a white cardboard box, and there was scratches everyone on the phone.
"
1867,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Very good value, almost as good as new, couple of very small scratches and battery 90%, but lot cheaper than new one, would recommend.
"
1868,B08PCCJP5C,2,"
Christmas present for my daughter. All seems to work ok, but definitely not excellent condition. Screen is cracked and lots of knocks evident around the camera with what appear to be chips on camera glass. Disappointed!
"
1869,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Bought renewed in excellent condition.Easy set up.  Great pictures.Highly recommended.Excellent service from seller.
"
1870,B08PCCJP5C,2,"
So, this 'excellent, no cosmetic damage visible from 30cm' condition phone didn't work out for me.  Didn't get as far as switching it on to comment on battery life etc.  Oh well, on to the next one.
"
1871,B08PCCJP5C,3,"
The product was good except for battery health. It was just 87% and the phone would heat up easily. The charger was not type c charger.
"
1872,B08PCCJP5C,2,"
Screen quickly scratched from the devastating onslaught of being in a soft empty pocket.  Back appears to be made of glass hewn from crystallised cheese.  My old SE lived 5 years without a scratch.  Bit cack really
"
1873,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
I was very worried about buying a secondhand/renewed iPhone, he has so many bad stories but I really couldn’t afford a brand-new one so I took a chance I was so so pleased the quality is fantastic it looks new the battery is 92% which is excellent lasts all day with use Spotify YouTube Facebook et cetera et cetera I am so happy with this product thank you Alison you still have not failed me
"
1874,B08PCCJP5C,2,"
Advertised as ""new"" but arrived with lots of marks and scratches to the screen.
"
1875,B08PCCJP5C,2,"
Very disappointed and pissed off. This was bought for a birthday present.. 18th. I felt so embarrassed when it didnt work proprely. As she needed it for college, I had to go out and buy another one in a local shop.
"
1876,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Very pleased indeed with the condition of this, considerably cheaper than new and other than a generic box and power adapter you’d never know it wasn’t new, excellent condition, unblemished screen and a battery health of nearly 90%  I wasn’t sure whether buying a “renewed” item was a good move but it’s been spot on
"
1877,B08PCCJP5C,4,"
Phone is just like new- really amazing quality, no bumps or scratches at all. My only concern is how hot it gets when using a few apps at a time, especially when using google maps or a similar app. I have to be very conscious to close all other running apps when using. Not sure if this is a general issue or not though!
"
1878,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Luckily covered Apple warranty for almost 8 months. Very good condition and happy with the purchase.Not got the Apple iPhone box, original charging cable. Phone is in great shape though with battery almost 100%.
"
1879,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
The Phone is in perfect working order and great condition
"
1880,B08PCCJP5C,2,"
Hidden damage means I can’t use it with an audio jack
"
1881,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Buying a second hand phone is always a bit of a risk if you don’t know the supplier. I am very pleased with the phone and would use the company again.
"
1882,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Really nice phone Excellent condition not a scratch on it like Brand-new would bye again from them. Value for money face recognition works fine battery life good thank you very much
"
1883,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Good no scratches and looks brand new. 88% battery life. Arrived quickly too
"
1884,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
4-5 teeny tiny marks on the top edge of the phone and a very very fine scratch on the back of maybe 2mm, but so small you need to be right up close, within a few centimetres of the phone really giving it a thorough examination. Rest of phone, including screen looks as new. Battery 99%. Came with what looks like an original apple plug and lightning cable (both usb, not usb-c) and sim ejector. All in all very pleased.
"
1885,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Five stars ⭐️
"
1886,B08PCCJP5C,1,"
I ordered an excellent condition iPhone which in the description states there will be no scratches on the screen. Upon receiving the item, the screen is covered in scratches with a few of them being long and deep. What’s the point in paying extra for excellent condition if it’s barely even ‘acceptable’ condition?
"
1887,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
IPhone arrived in 2 days , came in an unbranded box, sim tool & charger. Screen & body in excellent condition no marks or scratches with  battery health 95%.I used the phone for a week now so far I have not found an issue, I  tested playing video , photos, games and yes even phoned a friend. I not been able to test the wireless charging or Bluetooth earbuds with the phone.
"
1888,B08PCCJP5C,4,"
phone is good conditionI like the product
"
1889,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Was bought in error not realising it was renewed, seller very good and said they would accept return, phone  on arrival was great so my daughter decided to keep it.
"
1890,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Really pleased with my phone, looks brand new so glad I saved a bit of money by buying second hand with a years warranty included from a trusted Amazon seller. Delivery took a bit longer than expected but seems that was a Royal Mail error
"
1891,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Better than expected battery life not bad, but I use my phone a lot and I ask a lot from it and it don’t disappoints me.
"
1892,B08PCCJP5C,2,"
I bought one in ""excellent"" condition and got billed. This isn't in excellent condition. It is 89% battery and scratches all around the body. Screen is OK. Haven't tested further. Request immediate refund. Absolutely shame for ""Amazon quality"" selling this with misguided information.I can't believe Amazon has partner with this provider. My trust in Amazon brand has dip considerably. Think twice before you buy.Updated: you will need to pay for the return costs. Avoid this product please.
"
1893,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
If you have the money you are gonna B get better value b in the long. Run  buying an iPhone
"
1894,B08PCCJP5C,4,"
Phone was exactly as described no issues
"
1895,B08PCCJP5C,1,"
Bought this for a christmas present for my son, Has dinks and dents in the frame, wasted my time and now have to wait 5-7 days for money back upon return. Beware!
"
1896,B08PCCJP5C,2,"
Camera outer cover visibly scratched
"
1897,B08PCCJP5C,1,"
Also the battery life is at 88%! I was not aware of that ?! After what I was charged for the phone I am so unhappy with the product ?
"
1898,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
The phone surpassed my expectations when it arrived. The phone was clean and such good quality, it was as if it was new. No visible scratches and 100% battery health. I also like the packaging! The phone has an amazing camera and great sound quality. Glad it came with a cable too! I’m really glad I bought from this company, rather than getting a new phone from Apple. I’m really happy and I would recommend the phone to anyone.
"
1899,B08PCCJP5C,1,"
Upon arrival the phone looked as good as new and had 100% battery life.  After transferring data across the phone had no service.  I checked the IMEI and found it to be blacklisted.  Although I asked for replacement a refund was sent (still waiting 3 days on), and prices to buy another phone had increased.  Third party seller was Mazuma.
"
1900,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Excellent condition and speedy service
"
1901,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Almost like new. All works okay other than the iOS can’t analyse the battery health due to an unknown battery part as the message states.
"
1902,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
A very good quality refurbished iPhone 12 mint condition arrived swiftly good value for money . Would purchase from them again.
"
1903,B08PCCJP5C,1,"
Described as ‘excellent’ condition but numerous nicks around the edges of the phone and the screen has clearly been inadequately replaced as it is bent.Do NOT buy from Loop mobile!
"
1904,B08PCCJP5C,1,"
The item looked very used with scratches. Item was returned and still no confirmation about my refund.
"
1905,B08PCCJP5C,5,"

The phone was delivered quickly enough but I failed within 5 minutes of unboxing.Clearly the device had not been tested prior to dispatch.It’s wasted my time.
"
1921,B08PCCJP5C,1,"
Phone was badly damaged, scratches, dents visible from much more than 30cm. Old looking phone. Company takes days to respond back to you. Returned phone wanted me to wait another 5 days to see if had stock after waiting a week to get return label and for them to get the phone back.Awaiting refund off Amazon. Avoid at all costs. Purchased a mint phone off Apple which is refurbed, brand new battery and all coverings for 72 more. Full 12 warranty too with ApplePlease avoid, don’t make mistake I made. Selling rubbish, poor phones.

OMG this is a lot to spend on a reconditioned phone don’t they have any quality checking? This is the screen as it arrived. When bought it gave a 30 days money back guarantee but on the order it says we can only return by tomorrow which is the day the phone was supposed to arrive. Luckily it came a day early. On top of that the return address is completely illegible. Son is so disappointed as he spent he saved up for this.

1927,B08PCCJP5C,1,"
Disappointing to see so many chips - this phone has had a bit of a history.  Compounded by the screen simply not working.  All I had was a torch - not worth £473.99 then.

"
1937,B08PCCJP5C,1,"
Really annoyed to buy this and find that microphone not working. Took to apple store to run diagnostics and they told me phone had been already looked at by an apple store and same problem reported. Why can’t Phones Direct UK check before issuing ? Real hassle and now have to return.
"
1938,B08PCCJP5C,1,"
Came with no phone
"
1939,B08PCCJP5C,1,"
The seller gave me a faulty phone and and they should’ve done checks on it before selling it!! 0/5 never again!!
"
1940,B08PCCJP5C,1,"
I tried 3 different chips from 2 different brands and none of them worked.
"
1941,B08PCCJP5C,1,"
I want no association with apple, this was a purchase on my account not for me.
"
1942,B08PCCJP5C,2,"
Was expecting something with better battery life. 90% suggests this phone is getting old. Apple recommend changing battery at 80% so it’s half way there.Minor scratch on screen.Not really bowled over, it’s cheaper than a new phone but only time will tell if it turns out to be an actual saving over a contract phone.
"
1943,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Great price. Phone has 100% battery health and only 1 micro scratch on the screen. Looks basically brand new :)
"
1944,B08PCCJP5C,1,"
Warning, proceed with caution.  The phone I received had a faulty microphone and clearly had not been checked.  Took a few weeks to receive the refund, so not worth the hassle really compared to buying new.
"
1945,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
I’ve had this phone for 5 months now I still haven’t seen an issue with it. It works like a brand new phone. I’m amazed.

There's a little scratch on the screen. Also, finger prints readable somehow require a couple of attempts to recognise.

1951,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
this phone is in new condition. Unmarked with 100% battery life.A day late in arriving but that was a courier problem, not the companies fault.highly recommended and will deal with again going forward.

I owned a iPhone 11 and think it's time to upgrade to iPhone 12, but when I first received it was not impressed, after fully charges, a bit overheats and the camera is poor quality, my iPhone 11 better than these, so the next day I requested to return for full refund! I’m really disappointed in this product. getting a refund.

I can't say enough about this phone, as, in the header, it is like a brand-new iPhone. The battery charges to a full 100%, which I find is a problem many people find buying from anywhere else, some only charge to 80%, but not mine. I haven't found anything yet that doesn't work as it should, I cannot praise this seller enough, it's a brilliant piece of kit.

iPhone 12 reconditionné en parfait état. Le profit n’avais aucune rayure, on aurait dit un neuf. Mais après 3 mois d’utilisation je me suis rendu compte que je captais mal la 4 g et qu’elle était de mauvaise qualité. Aussi l’état de santé de ma batterie est passé de 100 a 90 % en 3 mois. La qualité chimique de la batterie m’as donc tout l’air d’être faible. Apart cela, très bon produit avec une super qualité.

Lievi inestetismi sulla scocca posteriore a livello delle fotocamere e dei lati, qualche graffio impercettibile sul vetro frontale, ma nulla che non mi aspettassi. La batteria all’85% mi ha un po’ deluso peró bisogna ammettere che era stato specificato in descrizione che le batterie erano dall’85% in poi (pensa che sfiga proprio a me doveva capitare il requisito minimo). Ho pagato a rate Cofidis. Per il resto é tutto normale, nessun danno di sistema. Poteva essere incartato meglio e la puntina per accedere al vano sim non c’era.

1960,B08PCCJP5C,4,"
Sono rimasto soddisfatto dell’acquisto. Presenta segni di caduta e sfregamento solo intorno alle fotocamere, sennò sarebbe stato come nuovo esteticamente. Non sono uno che ne fa un grande uso di social o programmi che stressano la CPU, quindi la batteria al 90% non è un ostacolo per me, ma comunque sarà sufficiente per la maggior parte degli acquirenti.

Compre el teléfono en estado excelente. De aspecto está casi como nuevo, tan sólo tiene unas pequeñas marcas en el marco.Las pegas que veo son la salud de la batería que está al 85% y siendo de estado excelente me esperaba que estuviera algo mejor y por último, viene sin caja original y con un cargador y cable del chino…

Arrivato in tempi previsti.La batteria è al 99% vediamo nel tempo come si comporta , unica pecca un graffio sullo schermo che non rispecchia la descrizione di prodotto eccellente ( che prevede che non si vedono segni evidenti a meno di 30 cm di distanza ). Il resto sembra funzionare tutto a dovere . Non do 5 stelle per il graffio . In ogni caso consiglio l’acquisto

Bonjour j’ai reçu le portable 2 jours après la commande ça rien à dire, le téléphone a seulement des chtons en haut et en bas sur le cadre aluminium, état de la batterie à 96%, au bout de 3 jours elle est descendu à 95%, tout fonctionne pour l’instant parfaitement bien, livré avec chargeur complet mais qui n’est pas de chez Apple, une coque transparente de qualité médiocre et un verre trempé pareil de qualité médiocre, mais ça protège pour l’instant c’est le principal. Voilà

1970,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
All'inizio ero molto titubante vista la spesa da sostenere: comprare un rigenerato su internet oppure no?Vista la dipartita del mio precedente telefono mi sono deciso ed ho proceduto con l'acquisto.Sono molto soddisfatto.Il packaging dell'oggetto è veramente misero ma, a mio avviso, ininfluente ai fini della valutazione: ho comprato un telefono non la scatola che lo contiene.Per cui, vista la mia esperienza, vi consiglio il venditore.
"
1971,B08PCCJP5C,4,"
Das Telefon hat als generalüberholtes Gerät ein sehr gutes Äußeres:- der Bildschirm ist makellos- Das Gehäuse hat einen winzigen Kratzer in einer Ecke, sonst fehlerfrei- technisch funktioniert alles wie bei einem NeugerätEinziges Manko:- die Batteriekapazität beträgt nur noch 80 %.Ein baugleiches anderes Gerät, was zwei Jahre im Dauerbetrieb ist, hat 88 %. Daraus schließe ich dass dieses Gerät mindestens drei Jahre alt sein dürfte.Wegen dieser 80 % max. Kapazität Bewerte ich das Gerät in Summe als „gut“ und mit vier Sternen.(Da 80 % für mich die akzeptable Grenze ist, habe ich das Gerät nicht umgetauscht.)

1972,B08PCCJP5C,4,"

Il telefono si presenta in maniera quasi perfetta per quello sono contentissimo ma la durata della batteria è veramente scarsa per l’autonomia quindi sono piuttosto deluso per il prezzo che l’ho pagato.

Ho preso per la prima volta un iphone per provare un sistema diverso rispetto ad un android e l'ho trovo molto intuitivo, semplice e veloce. E' arrivato con un giorno di anticipo rispetto al previsto e apparte qualche ammaccatura leggera nei bordi della scocca del telefono ( cosa prevedibile in quanto comprato ricondizionato con dicitura buono e non eccellente) perfettamente funzionante, veloce e e in buone condizioni. Qualità prezzo ottimo, il più conveniente rispetto a tutti gli altri. Assolutamente soddisfatto dell'acquisto fatto!
"
1977,B08PCCJP5C,4,"
Spedizione molto veloce (nonostante non fosse Amazon), arrivato un giorno prima del previsto.Condizioni: eccellenti e ho notato un leggero e quasi impercettibile graffietto (davvero minuscolo) sulla parte bassa dello schermo e lo stato della batteria era dell’84% (e speravo di avere una percentuale più bassa, ma purtroppo no, su amazon le condizioni “Eccellenti” assicurano dall’80% dello stato della batteria in poi).Per il resto veramente tutto perfetto, é il mio primo iPhone e penso non sarà assolutamente l’ultimo e sono onestamente felice di aver abbandonato Android.Perché passare da Android ad iOS?- stabilità nel sistema- aggiornamenti precisi e che sicuramente copriranno il dispositivo per parecchi anni (di media 4).- applicazioni ed integrazioni perfettamente ottimizzate con il dispositivo- se ormai (come me) vi siete annoiati nello smanettare con un telefono e della personalizzazione totale ve ne frega poco allora questo potrebbe essere anche un altro motivo per passare ad iOS, ma attenzione, iOS permette tranquillamente una bella parte di personalizzazione ma sempre fino ad un certo punto.

Durée de vie de batterie à 85% autant dire que dans un an il faudra changer… déception mais rentre dans leur condition de vente 80% minimum.

Spedizione tutto sommato nei tempi, considerando che il corriere era fedex. iPhone come nuovo salvo qualche lievissimo graffio, batteria al 100%, cavo Apple e caricatore originale inclusi.
"
1981,B08PCCJP5C,4,"
Ottimo prodotto. Il cellulare non ha neanche un graffio. L’ unica cosa che mi ha dispiaciuto un pó: un cellulare con lo stato “eccellente” dovrebbe avere uno stato di batterio superiore a 90%. (mi è arrivato con 85%) Peró, di sicuro mi prenderó un altro cellulare ricondizionato.
"
1982,B08PCCJP5C,4,"
Questo smartphone non ha bisogno di presentazioni, quindi non dirò nulla su aspetti tecnici o cose simili. Quello che è importante sottolineare, a mio avviso, è la qualità di un prodotto ricondizionato come questo che comunque richiede un esborso economico non indifferente per le tasche della maggior parte delle persone. Quindi il dubbio è sempre lo stesso: prendere un prodotto ricondizionato risparmiando qualche centinaia di euro o fare un ulteriore sforzo e prenderlo nuovo.Ho preso questo telefono per mia figlia quasi adolescente, era da tempo che voleva un iPhone, visto che quasi tutte le sue amiche ce l'hanno. Alla fine ho ceduto ma col patto di spendere al massimo una cifra intorno a 500 euro. Così è stato,  ho preso questo iPhone 12 ricondizionato a 555 euro. Il giudizio sul prodotto è assolutamente positivo. Il telefono è praticamente nuovo, non ha un minimo grasso, nessun difetto di assemblaggio, la batteria dura tranquillamente una giornata. Assolutamente nulla da dire.Il telefono arriva in una scatola non originale con cavo e caricabatteria non originale.Dopo un mesetto ho dovuto cambiare il cavetto in dotazione con un altro da 3A/20w.Consiglio l'acquisto di questo prodotto.

Acquistato ricondizionato ma l’articolo si presenta in perfette condizioni. No graffi, no ammaccature, schermo nuovo e no imperfezioni. Esattamente come nuovo.Ovviamente essendo però ricondizionato non arriva con scatola nuova ufficiale Apple, ma con una anonima del venditore. Non credo sia un problema!

1993,B08PCCJP5C,3,"
Ero molto neutro a comprare un telefono ricondizionato ma il prezzo mi ha convinto, l’ho comprato e devo dire che sono contento, batteria arrivata al 89% (buono secondo me, poteva essere di meno) e il telefono in uno stato praticamente perfetto, solo una piccola graffa nello speaker però neanche si vede se non lo sai. Il telefono è anche arrivato qualche giorno prima della data di consegna prevista, cosa molto positiva.L’unica cosa che direi come parte non molto positiva è il fatto che lo schermo non sembra di essere quello originale, e per questo non metto 4 stelle. Spunta un messaggio in impostazioni che dice ciò, però, come ho detto prima, per il prezzo sono soddisfatto perché comunque funziona perfettamente. Sinceramente lo comprerei di nuovo.

Para el uso que le doy (redes sociales, cámara, juegos) no tengo ninguna queja. Ni siquiera la batería está tan mal como pensaba (me vino al 85% de salud). Lo único es que tenía algunas mejores expectativas en la calidad de la cámara, por ejemplo a contraluz o a oscuras no me ha llegado a convencer, pero fuera de eso, si se tiene una buena iluminación realmente no tengo quejas, ninguna.

Prodotto arrivato una prima volta con un problema alla batteria, servizio clienti ottimo perchè me lo hanno ritirato e riparato in tempi brevissimi. Purtroppo però ho comprato un telefono in condizioni eccellenti (come da descrizione non dovrebbero esserci graffi visibili oltre i 30 cm) ma lo schermo presenta molti graffi nei bordi abbastanza visibili. Una stella in più perchè la batteria è al 100%.

 Ho acquistato questo Iphone 12 blu (128Gb) ricondizionato in condizioni ""eccellenti"" al prezzo di 660€. Le condizioni sono molto buone, ma è comunque presente un leggero segno sul pannello posteriore (come da foto) e lo schermo è perfetto (forse addirittura nuovo). La batteria risulta essere al 89% della capacità massima.Il prodotto ovviamente è ottimo, ma per condizione ""eccellenti"" mi sarei aspettato una batteria con capacità > 90% e nessun segno sul pannello posteriore (soprattutto considerando il costo pagato).Per questo motivo non do 5 stelle... Segnalo inoltre che nella confezione era addirittura presente un vetro protettivo e una cover trasparente (sorpresa molto gradita).Se ritieni utile questa recensione, sarebbe carino un pollice all'insù.Grazie

Comprato come usato in condizioni ""Eccellenti"" ma sono evidenti graffi sugli angoli superiori ben visibili, non ben pulito e batteria con poco più 80% di massima carica. Schermo integro con proteggi schermo già applicato. Per un telefono pagato circa il 25% meno di uno nuovo sorge il dubbio se ne è valsa la pena. La spedizione gestita come da aspettativa, ma confezione semplice con imballo protettivo un pò semplice. Ho acquistato da poco Phone usato da società tedesca che lo ha spedito in una confezione e packaging simile all'originale e in condizioni da quasi nuovo con lo stesso sconto. Ci sono ampi margini di miglioramento nella gestione dell'usato imparando da altri.

Calidad precio es aceptable. Lo único malo es que lo compre en condición excelente y muestra arañazos a mas de 30cm de distancia, no al revés como decía la publicación ya que no tenia que verse ningún arañazo a mas de 30cm. Cumplieron lo de la batería, que su vida útil (capacidad) es mayor al 80%. La pantalla si me puso un poco a dudar ya que pienso que no esta bien ensamblada porque se puede apreciar que se sale del marco muy ligeramente y si le aplico un poco de presión se observa que se hunde un poco.De resto me funciona todo bien, cumplieron casi como estaba descrito en la publicación.Lo recomiendo si no quieren gastar mucho mas y si no les importa ciertas características quitando los rasguños puede valer la pena para algunos.Mirarlo bien!

A parte de que llevo buscando este IPhone hace tiempo porque me gusta bastante. En general muy alegre por la compra, ya que el teléfono únicamente me ha venido con un pico en un lateral que apenas se ve el pico ya que es pequeño.

Inizio dicendo che il prodotto mi è arrivato in ottime condizioni, non nella sua scatola originale ma in una targata ""loop"" con il cavetto originale e addirittura con un caricatore non originale ma nuovo, il prodotto ripeto si presenta molto bene, nessun graffio evidente e nessun tipo di danneggiamento vario, anche lo schermo risulta immacolato e ben tenuto, la batteria nel mio caso era al 99% ma devo segnalare che dopo nemmeno 3 mesi la percentuale è scesa al 95%, personalmente cerco di preservare il più possibile la batteria, ovvero non farlo scaricare oltre il 20% e non farlo caricare oltre 80% (sarà arrivato 5 volte al massimo al 100% e 5 volte sotto il 20% ma mai sotto il 15%, il dispositivo è sempre stato caricato con il caricatore originale della Apple da 20W, quindi valutate voi se è normale questo aspetto. Altra nota dolente è la fotocamera che da qualche giorno ha iniziato ad avere degli artefatti all'interno delle fotografie o video scattati in presenza di poca luce o con un fonte luminosa piazzata frontalmente, oltre a questi problemi devo dire che il telefono funziona davvero bene, nel caso il problema della batteria e della fotocamera dovessero divenire ancora più marcati valuterò se fare il reso. In fin dei conti direi un buon 7.5, magari sono stato sfortunato io.[AGGIORNAMENTO]Segnalo che da giugno la capacità della batteria è scesa fino al 90%, questo a mio parere denota che la batteria molto probabilmente è stata sostituita con una non performante o non originale.[AGGIORNAMENTO 2]Segnalo che la luminosità dello schermo in alcune situazioni diventa davvero bassa, nonostante la luminosità automatica sia disattivata e inoltre non si può alzare e questo comporta che sotto il sole non si veda assolutamente nulla, credo che questo problema sia dato da una sorta di surriscaldamento del dispositivo.Se hai trovato utile la mia recensione sarebbe bello se lasciassi un bel 👍

*Edito porque ha habido cambios en la bateria.La batería llegó con una salud del 97% y a los 11 días está al 95%. Lo cargo únicamente por la noche ya que me llega a final del día sin problema, pero me sorprende que esté bajando la salud tan rápido.Una de las lentes ha venido con varios arañazos, me lo han pulido y ya apenas se ven.Como curiosidad añadir que el iPhone es importado y no decía nada en la descripción, pero todavía no sé si eso podría afectar en algo actualmente o en un futuro en Europa, así que no sé si puede ser algo beneficioso o perjudicial.

C'est la première fois que cela m'arrive et j'en suis très déçu. Il y a eu un réel problème de communication entre Chronopost, la Poste et l'expéditeur sur le colis. Les informations n'étaient pas les mêmes pour chacun. Ce qui a fait que je me suis retrouvé avec un remboursement alors que j'avais bien reçu mon téléphone. Ce téléphone qui d'ailleurs était en parfait Etat comme je l'avais commandé. Aucunes rayures, qualité au top, et batterie à 100 !!! Mon téléphone faisait la journée complète et remplaçait l'ancien qui beug énormément. Mais que je dois reprendre aujourd'hui car je me retrouve contraint de rendre le téléphone acheté. Et pour ces gros problèmes de communication je suis déçu. J'ai acheté ce téléphone durant le black friday et je dois le racheter aujourd'hui, avec un prix plus conséquent... Ce qui est impossible pour un étudiant comme moi.

Donc à voir avec le temps mais là franchement bravo.

batteria al 96% un buon inizio, prestazioni buone e nella norma, carica senza problemi, alcuni difetti estetici quasi impercettibili, ma un occhio attento come il mio li nota, spero non abbia problemi futuri, schermo originale, reparto fotocamera il quadratino sembra sostituito

Rapporto qualità-prezzo perfetta, cellulare in condizioni perfette ed eccellenti, confezionato con estrema cura della sicurezza del prodotto in caso di urti. Purtroppo avevo ordinato con ulteriore spesa per l’arrivo il giorno successivo al mio ordine anche se ho Amazon prime, ma arrivato due giorni dopo. Questo non altera che il telefono si perfetto per come lo propone Amazon.

Il telefono in sè funziona e non male, però da un telefono in condizioni ‘Eccellenti’ non mi aspettavo così tanti piccoli graffi sul vetro, tra l’altro alcuni visibili anche applicando la pellicola, e lo stato batteria all’84%. Lo terrò però direi più ‘Buone/ottime condizioni’, la parola ‘eccellente’ mi sembra un po’ troppo
"
2051,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Prácticamente igual que nuevo, sin ningún tipo de marca o señal que haga pensar que es reacondicionado. Solo el cargador y el cable no son originales.
"

esta en muy buen estado en general, lo unico malo que le veo es la bateria que tiene un 84 de salud

Prodotto ottimo, come da descrizione. Molto soddisfatto. Nota molto negativa sul corriere SDA, poiché inventa inesistenti modifiche dell'ultimo minuto alla spedizione da parte del cliente, probabilmente dettate dal voler giustificare ritardi nelle consegne. Io non ho mai chiesto rinvii né modifiche alla spedizione!

Arrivato in anticipo rispetto al previsto, solo leggermente graffiato nella parte bassa del device per il resto eprfetto.Batteria 85%.. tutti i pezzi sono originali, quindi sono soddisfatto.
"
2060,B08PCCJP5C,3,"
Il telefono è arrivato sano, con tutte le parti funzionanti però si vede che non è pari al nuovo, nonostante io abbia scelto la categoria A, è arrivato graffiato ai lati della fotocamera e leggermente graffiato sulla parte finale del cellulare anche se non si nota molto.La batteria era dell'88% dunque tra un anno dovrei già cambiarla.Consiglio se non si vuole spendere molto ma tuttavia non vi aspettate chissà che.
"
2061,B08PCCJP5C,4,"
Il telefono è arrivato oggi rispetta la condizione eccellente il telefono è arrivato come nuovo, speravo nella batteria più del 90% mi è arrivato un 88% comunque vediamo nel tempo per ora tutto ok.

Se non sapessi che è stato ricondizionato, potrei credere che sia nuovo. Lo smartphone in pratica non ha un segno che possa farmi pensare che sia stato usato, anche la batteria dalla durata sembra nuovo. Consigliatissimo!!!
"
2071,B08PCCJP5C,3,"
Due scalfiture (di cui una abbastanza evidente; vedi foto) sulla scocca ed una percentuale di batteria già all’ 88% (per un telefono uscito 2 anni fa) non mi permettono di essere soddisfatto.

J'achète un iPhone 12 blanc 128Go reconditionné avec la mention ""Excellent état"". On paie plus cher pour ça, et d'après les critères du vendeur : ""Corps : aucun signe de dommage cosmétique lorsqu'il est tenu à 30 centimètres de distance"". Sauf qu'on voir des tas d'impacts sur les anneaux de protection des obkectifs photo, même à 1m de distance !Également, des traces collantes (probablement laissées par une ancienne protection de mauvaise qualité) sont mal enlevées.Enfin, la batterie était usagée (capacité 79%, « à réparer » affiché sur le téléphone ) au lieu des plus de 80% garantis.Pour les traces, ça va encore, mais les anneaux abîmés, c'est clairement pas dans les critères ""Excellent état"" du vendeur 😡Je vais renvoyer cet article, et je changerai mon évaluation en fonction de ce qui se passe ensuite…

J’ai acheté cet IPhone 12 bleu 128 go, l’écran a visiblement été  changé car le joint du carter n’est pas bien positionné. Le principal problème est que le haut parleur du haut a commencé par grésiller et maintenant il ne fonctionne plus!!! Impossible d’entendre quoi que ce soit, impossible d’entendre un correspondant ni aucun son…Très déçu !!!Amazon ne me propose ni échange ni réparation seulement remboursement sachant que pour en acheter un nouveau cela me coûterait plus cher ! Incompréhensible sachant que le produit est garantie un an…

Ne ho comprati due uno bianco è uno nero (il bianco ha dei graffi) arrivati senza scatola chiusi in una busta delle lettere, cavetto troppo grosso per caricarli devo levare la cover!  comprati a marzo a distanza di 4 mesi la batteria è scesa a 96% e il nero devo ricaricarlo più volte al giorno si scarica velocemente! Batteria non affidabile per niente ho chiesto il reso meglio comprare un prodotto nuovo.

2094,B08PCCJP5C,2,"
Acquistato Iphone 12 128 gb il 22 Novembre, prezzo molto competitivo per un dispositivo in condizioni ""eccellenti"" che poi si è rivelato tutto il contrario. Il dispositivo infatti presentava ammaccature molto visibili sulla scocca da oltre 30 cm di distanza (al contrario di quanto scritto sul sito) e lo schermo presentava dei graffi ben visibili anche senza tenere il dispositivo controluce. Inoltre presa lightning e altoparlante frontale sporchi con presenza di polvere, non il massimo per un dispositivo che dovrebbe essere testato e ripulito.Nemmeno configurato, effettuerò il reso. Spero sia stato solo un caso perchè il prezzo era ottimo e la spedizione sempre al top su amazon.

Compre el producto aproximadamente el 5 de agosto en estado excelente, a dia de hoy, 28 de noviembre ha bajado un 7% la salud de la bateria (Ya vieniendo con algunas marcas de uso y un 94% de salud), algo bastante raro que baje tan rapido no dandole mucho uso dia a dia (llego al final del dia con aprox un 45% y lo pongo a cargar con el cargador proporcionado, supuestamente compatible, y no dejandolo por la noche), hoy me encontrado con la sorpresa de que casi se podria haber quemado el escritorio porque el cable proporcionado (supuestamente, certificado por MFi) a empezado a echar humo.Aparte de todo esto, el movil es la versión de EEUU (a2172), que no deberia ser un problema en cuanto a las bandas, aunque el 5G no ha funcionado correctamente (teniendo antena cerca de casa y comprobado con la misma SIM en un movil 5G [Mi10T] ).En cuanto al resto, vino bien empaquetado, sin la caja original (no es problema).Se pide la devolución, ya que no termino de fiarme de que el terminal este en buen estado o no el indicado despues de haber pasado un tiempo de prueba bastante extenso.

Pessima esperienza: ho acquistato due iPhone 12 in condizioni ""eccellenti"" che mi sono pervenuti con schermi non originali e di cattiva qualità, nonostante la descrizione dell'oggetto parli solo della possibilità di accessori (e non componenti) non originali - problema non da poco dato il prezzo pagato. Una volta contattato, il venditore non sembra aver dato alcuna importanza al problema.
"
2103,B08PCCJP5C,3,"
Inizio col dire che è un ricondizionato a metà e questo perché è indecente avere un telefono che è stato testato e rimesso a nuovo ma con un auricolare gracchiante. Impossible fare telefonate se non con l'auricolare e poi gli audio di WhatsApp a volte manco si sentono bisogna riavviare l'App. Oltretutto il telefono scalda in una maniera allucinante soprattutto quando si ricarica in wireless. Meno male che c'è la garanzia Amazon renewed perché farò sicuramente il reso

Lo smartphone si presentava in ottimo stato pari al nuovo venduto come ricondizionato eccellente solo che hanno usato dei ricambi non originali ( display )Apple che oltre a far perdere valore allo smartphone non assicurano la durata di esso..spedizione veloce chiesto immediatamente il reso

Il telefono mi è arrivato con un graffio sulla fotocamera posteriore ,mentre quella anteriore anche se la pulisco mi trasmette l’immagine sempre e comunque sfocata sul display ,apparte questi due problemi che mi infastidiscono il telefono è praticamente quasi  nuovo peccato che in oltre dopo un po’ di giorni che lo sto usando ho notato che una cassa audio non va e l’hot spot non si può attivare per via di Danni tecnici
"
2111,B08PCCJP5C,1,"
Telefono arrivato in anticipo, tutto perfetto fino all'accensione. Ho notato subito che la cornice nera era stranamente spessa (più del mio iPhone 12 originale) e che il lato inferiore era addirittura più spesso degli altri, decentrando così l'immagine. Allora con il dubbio che si trattasse di un ricambio ho guardato più attentamente e ho visto che la nitidezza delle scritte era decisamente peggiore. Finita la configurazione ho avuto la conferma nelle impostazioni dove è riportato che lo schermo è una parte sconosciuta, probabilmente non originale.Capisco la necessità di ricondizionare telefoni con schermi danneggiati, ma mi metti un display cinese sgranato e lo spacci anche per A+?State attenti ai dettagli.

2119,B08PCCJP5C,1,"
Nel giro di pochi mesi il telefono ha iniziato ad avere degli spegnimenti improvvisi e alla riaccensione il livello della batteria era cambiato dal 90 al 20% , mai una caduta , sempre trattato con perizia , gli ultimi giorni ha smesso di ricevere la carica e restava acceso al 1% solo se collegato , ma senza andare oltre quella percentuale  . Sulle impostazioni messaggio di errore che avvisa che la batteria non è originale e forse proprio per questo è durata così poco , assurdo per un telefono pagato 640 euro e tra l’altroregalato . Chiesto reso e oltre il danno la beffa perché dovrò restare una settimana o forse più senza telefono perché avrò rimborso solo dopo che il venditore riceverà l’oggetto.
"
2120,B08PCCJP5C,1,"
eigentlich sollte ich ein Foto mit einstellen. Das Gerät habe ich jedoch dirket wieder verpackt und retourniert. Dieses Gerät als ""ausgezeichnet"" für 550 Euro zu verkaufen ist eine bodenlose Frechtheit. Das Gerät hat noch nie eine Schutzfolie gesehen, außerdem ist der Vorbesitzter wohl mit einer Ecke an einer Hauswand entlang geschlittert oder es viel aus entsprechender Höhe auf den Asphalt. Total abgeranzt. Sowas hab ich noch nie geschafft mit meinen Smartphones, welche mal gestürzt sind.Dass Amazon für sowas seinen/ihren Namen hinhält ist kaum zu glauben. Ich habe kein Neugerät erwartet aber das Teil gehört eigentlich entsorgt. Unglaublich, unterirdisch, für dumm verkauft oder inkompetente Mitarbeiter. Nie wieder generalüberholt.

2121,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Venditore raccomandato! Il telefono (acquistato in condizionino eccellenti) sembra a tutti gli effetti nuovo, ad eccezione della batteria 89%,comunque dura tutta la giornata se lo si usa normalmente.Pare funzioni tutto alla perfezione , in caso aggiornerò la recensione
"
2122,B08PCCJP5C,2,"
il telefono è arrivato 2 settimane prima della data prevista, quindi il venditore è stato davvero efficiente; peccato che abbia dovuto restituirlo perchè l'audio all'orecchio e in vivavoce era basso, non regolabile e disturbato. ok invece quello in cuffia. Il telefono dal punto di vista estetico era in condizione perfette

Telefono arrivato con bordi ammaccati ma lievemente, schermo non compatibile con il dispositivo, surriscaldamento estremo della batteria (non usabile per più di 5min) andava a fuoco, cristalli liquidi scadenti, microfono mal funzionante. Tutto questo risolvibile, ma venditore mi ha accusato mi aver fatto danni, quando io ho inviato subito foto e prove subito all’arrivo del telefono. Scortese e maleducati. Per me non sono dei venditori terzi a cui affidarsi. Avevo chiesto aiuto a loro e mi hanno detto di aspettare 14 gg, così da farmi perdere la garanzia A-Z Amazon. Per fortuna non ho aspettato e sono stato rimborsato. Amazon affidabile. LOMBARDO SHOP VERAMENTE EVITABILE
"
2126,B08PCCJP5C,5,"
Prodotto arrivato in anticipo, non nella scatola originale di iPhone ma in una scatola del venditore, senza auricolari ne alimentatore (per non è un problema perché avevo già un iPhone e userò quelli), ma il telefono è in ottime condizioni, non ha un graffio sembra nuovo. Se vogliamo trovare un difetto la batteria è al 90% ma essendo ricondizionato ci sta. Venditore consigliato, perché ho letto  recensioni dello stesso prodotto ma di altri venditori e quasi tutti si lamentavano di segni di usura.

El móvil que recibí estaba impoluto por fuera, únicamente tenía unas marcas en el cristal mínimas. Lo único que tuve que devolverlo debido a que se reiniciaba constantemente y había momentos que se quedaba la pantalla en negro y no encendía. El servicio postventa no me dio ninguna opción a la hora de comentárselo y que me mandaran otro y hacerme otro tipo de compensación, me dijeron mándalo y te reembolsamos el dinero, lo que demuestra dejadez por su parte y poco buen trato hacia el cliente. Por esto le pongo una estrella.

La batterie est à 87% de sa capacité originale, le bouton pour mettre le telephone en silencieux est abimé, l'écran du téléphone reste noir durant les appels, et ce jusqu'a ce que votre interlocuteur raccroche, la peinture est écaillé à plein d'endroit, ce n'est pas un téléphone reconditionné c'est un téléphone d'occasion.

Ricevuto iphone ricondizionato  in tempi rapidi, come al solito con Amazon, caratteristiche esterne apparentemente buone. Dopo le (lunghe) procedure di installazione e configurazione scopro che l'auricolare del cell non funziona e non si sente nulla!!! Con un po' di rabbia penso: può capitare... cerco le politiche di reso e scopro che devo fare il reso A MIE SPESE!!!!! Quindi devo perdere del tempo ad andare in posta e buttare dei soldi per restituire una cosa che non va!NO, ATTENZIONE AL MARKETPLACE ED A QUESTO VENDITORE IN PARTICOLARE CHE ADOTTA QUESTA POLITICA SCORRETTA. MAI PIU

Pensavo peggio!! Ho comprato iPhone 12 ricondizionato in condizioni accettabili e devo dire oltre a una piccola ammaccatura sulla scocca e qualche graffio sui laterali è perfetto. Vetro anteriore e posteriore intatti e fotocamera funzionante. Batteria al 93%

2165,B08PCCJP5C,1,"
Venditore scorretto!Ho preso un Iphone12 ricondizionato (in ottime condizioni estetiche) ma dopo nemmeno un mese ha smesso di funzionare senza apparenti motivi, senza subire ne cadute ne urti.Amazon mi ha autorizzato il reso per garanzia ma l'assistenza del fornitore rifiuta il rimborso o sostituzione perchè nella cover mi ci è venuto un graffio. E per un graffio mi invalidi la garanzia di questo grave malfunzionamento?  Intanto il cellulare non funziona più.Roba da vergognarsi! Venditore sconsigliato!
"
2166,B08PCCJP5C,5,"

Telefono pieno di graffi sulle fotocamere, ammaccature sul bordo del telefono e memoria al 90% e considerato che ho acquistato il telefono allo stato eccellente mi è impossibile accettare questi compromessi.Ho fatto il reso e cosa peggiore in tutto questo è che in 5 giorni che l'ho fatto non hanno ancora controllato in che stato si trova(l'ho usato letteralmente 5min) e non mi hanno ancora fatto il reso.Servizio clienti imbarazzante! Per niente soddisfatto

Acheté en ""Excellent état"", pour rappel Amazon annonce comme critères :""Écran : aucune rayure, Corps : aucun signe de dommage cosmétique lorsqu'il est tenu à 30 centimètres de distance.""Le téléphone présente pourtant une rayure bien visible sur l'écran et la peinture autour des deux objectifs photo est écaillée. Les deux défauts sont visible au premier coup d'oeil donc le vendeur est soit incompétent soit malhonnête, aux choix.Pour ce qui est de la batterie je ne peux pas me prononcer. Je ne suis pas allé jusqu'à l'allumer, il est retourné directement dans sa boite.En attente de remboursement.

Abbiamo ordinato un telefono nero ed è arrivato blu ma siccome era urgente (abbiamo pagato anche la spedizione) poichè mia figlia studia fuori città ed era senza telefono, lo abbiamo tenuto, comprando una cover nera;-). Dopo 20 giorni non riconosce più la SIM (che provata nel mio telefono funziona). Abbiamo chiesto la sostituzione, speriamo siano rapidi (mia figlia è a casa una settimana) e che stavolta.. funzioni. È vero che è rigenerato ma costa quasi come nuovo. Peccato, la telecamera è valida e per 3 settimane è stato un buon telefono.

2184,B08PCCJP5C,1,"
En mi caso, el teléfono vino con la cámara delantera estropeada. Por fuer atenía algún rasguño pero no pude ni iniciarlo xq no me funcionaba el reconocimiento facial. Lo devolveré en lo que pueda, estoy esperando que me conteste el vendedor.

Complessivamente ottimo a livello display ed estetico e nella dotazione completa la batteria mi aspettavo un po’ meglio del 90%

2187,B08PCCJP5C,1,"
El teléfono llegó en aparente buen estado. La pantalla estaba cambiada, pero al ser reacondicionado, es algo comprensible. Sin embargo, a la semana de usarlo, falló el Face ID y he tenido que devolverlo. Tal y como he leído en otros comentarios, quizá deberían revisar algo mejor los teléfonos reacondicionados antes de venderlos, pues es una auténtica lotería. El servicio de logística por parte de Amazon para la devolución y resolver dudas, inmejorable. Me acabo de comprar uno nuevo para no llevarme más sustos. XD

Compre este iphone en estado excelente y ponía que las imperfecciones no se notarian a 30cm y que serian de menos de medio centímetro, pues son de unos 2cm y si pasas la uña se queda enganchada de lo profundas que son los rallados de la pantalla y le ponen el cristal porque asi se aprecian mucho menos

Non capisco perché mi è stata cancellata la precedente recensione.Quindi la riscrivo: l'iPhone 12 verde vednuto da RG RENT è tutto graffiato con un graffio importante sulla fotocamera anteriore/face ID. A volte nn riconosce il FaceID e se metto una pellicola il FACE ID non viene proprio riconosciuto e quindi sono costretto ad usare il codice di sblocco o a rimuovere la pellicola!L'ho comprato perché c'era la dicitura: condizioni eccellenti. Non chiedevo un iPhone nuovo di zecca, ma almeno uno con pochi graffi e un pò più nuovo. Ho gia richiesto il reso. Lo comprerò da un altro venditore

Ho scritto al venditore ancora senza risposta, l’iPhone che ho ricevuto ieri pomeriggio ha il frame in alluminio con profonde ammaccature e graffi, il che è molto lontano dalla descrizione “nessun segno di imperfezione a distanza di 30cm”, sono segni visibili anche a 1m (purtroppo). In queste condizioni un iPhone nuovo scontato è un’opzione più dignitosa.

Rapporto qualità prezzo direi basso/molto basso, si paga un iPhone ricondizionato 100€ in meno rispetto al nuovo e ti arriva con la scocca rovinata su tutti gli angoli, lo schermo è ok, ma sinceramente mi aspettavo molto di meglio.Mi ritengo deluso dall’acquisto, e consiglio di non fidarsi troppo della descrizione del prodotto “difetti estetici non visibili da 1 metro” mi sembra un po’ una presa in giro, i difetti si vedono, da ben più di 1 metro

Ich hatte mich sehr auf das Handy gefreut und konnte kaum auf die Lieferung warten.Ich bin zutiefst enttäuscht gewesen als ich die grüne elektrische Linie am Display sah. 😲Ich meine das Handy kostet gerade nicht wenig und man hätte sich bisschen Mühe bei der Überprüfung des Handys und der Verpackung geben können.Bevor das Handy ankam habe ich das passende Panzerglas und die passende Hülle gekauft was mir etwa 40€ gekostet habe, und selbst die haben mich mehr Freude gemacht als das Handy.Nun habe ich das Vertrauen verloren und leider nicht zu empfehlen.🥲

This will be a long and detailed review. I am writing this to guide those who are hesitant whether to get an iPhone or not, and which iPhone to get. I will start by focusing on the iPhone 13 Pro model, but I will speak more generally towards the end, especially when comparing iOS versus Android Products.iPhone 13 Pro Overview:I had the chance to unbox this device and set it up as my new main device. Prior to this I was using a Samsung Note and a Realme smartphones.- Box Contents and Eco-Friendliness:The iPhone 13 Pro box contains paper leaflets, sticker, a cable, and of course phone. The phone itself is wrapped in recyclable material rather than eco-unfriendly plastic. Part of the switch to Apple is what I personally see as an effort from them to go green, in addition to other reasons I will discuss below.- Design and Build Quality:The iPhone 13 Pro is simply amazing in terms of design. Holding it feels almost like holding the previous 12 Pro model, albeit the 13 Pro comes with noticeable bigger cameras and smaller notch.The body is flawless and the graphite option is the best in my view as I like neutral-lowkey'ish colours. The other colours are equally appealing but the graphite just felt suitable for my personal tastes. The side frame is stainless steel and the whole phone feels really solid. I have seen JerryRig's video where he tries to bend the iPhone 13 Pro and phone managed to survive and stay fully intact. Jerry also used a lighter to try and burn the screen, and it didn't! Despite being exposed to continuous lighter flames for around a minute (You should check it out).Compared to the 12 Pro, the iPhone 13 Pro is slightly heavier (209g vs 189g) and slightly thicker (7.7mm vs 7.4mm).- Specs:Stats are the last thing I consider recently since most flagships pack the latest technology and all fly through tasks easily. We seem to live in an age where the hardware capabilities is outweighing the requirements of most, if not all, apps and games.The iPhone 13 Pro packs a 3095 mAH battery which is bigger and better than the previous iPhone 12 Pro's battery. It has a Super Retina XDR OLED display with a 120HZ refresh rate (Finally they left the old 60HZ rate). The refresh rate is variable, meaning that drops for less demanding apps, which adds to the preserving of energy. The display is very bright and can be seen easily and clearly in bright daylight. It has a brightness of 1000nits with a peak of 1200nits. It packs the latest Apple A15 bionic 5 nanometer chip. This chip provides fast performance and adds to iPhones' AI capabilities. The GPU has five cores compared to four in the 12 Pro. The  iPhone 13 Pro comes with 6GB of RAM but we know that doesn't really matter since it is faster than phones with 12GB of RAM. So enough with the dull specs and lets talk about the actual performance!- Speed and Responsiveness:The iPhone, iPad and MacBook family is well-known for its flawlessness in terms of responsiveness, and this iPhone 13 Pro is no different. Expect a very fast performance that wouldn't degrade for years. Apps open fast and all operations happen seamlessly. Although the iOS 15 is relatively a new update, there isn't much bugs around, and a couple small bugs highlighted by customers have already been patched.- Battery Life and charging:The iPhone only comes with a lightning cable, so if you never owned an Apple device you may need to get a wall plug. The iPhone only requires 23W load, but it still supports a convenient level of fast charging, making it able to go from 0% to 50% in 30 minutes. I think Apple could have gone way higher in terms of load, and way lower in terms of charging time, but that would equally reduce the shelf life of the battery and makes it degrade quickly, so a sweet middle spot is more convenient for long term owners. A fully charged iPhone 13 Pro would sustain you for the whole day, with around 30% remaining at the end of the day. My test is based on a day of regular surfing, watching videos, taking pictures and videos (like stories and reels), and casual gaming (like candy crush). The battery performance is way better than the 12 Pro in my opinion, and second just to the 13 Pro max.Note: there are phones that go from 0% to 60 or 80% in way less time than the iPhone 13 Pro. As I have said those phones are speculated to degrade the battery life span faster and release a lot of heat, but it is up to you to decide your preferences, especially if you constantly forget to charge your phone at night and you require very fast charging.- Camera Quality and Modes:Over the years, iPhones never possessed the best camera title. Rather, they managed to earn the best round-up camera performance. For instance, there are telephoto lenses better than the iPhone 13 Pro telephoto, and a wide angle that's better than the iPhone 13 Pro. however, in my view there is no phone that combines a robust multi-lens performance as good as the iPhone does. If you want a versatile camera, an incredible bokeh effect, a crisp and sharp video with the best stabilisation I ever tried, and an amazing post-production processing and editing, then I am certain no phone can outweigh the current iPhone 13 Pro and Pro max. The quality is simply amazing and the software support accompanying the camera app is what sets this years head of the rest. I advise you to check videos that showcase the camera performance.- Software Support and iOS 15:There are many people out there who don't understand why people pay much for iPhones. These people are usually unaware of the seamlessness created by the Apple eco-system. Having an iPhone, iPad, MacBook, and to a lesser extent a watch and earbuds, is the only resort for you to understand how the ecosystem works. I was suspicious a year ago but once into the ecosystem, I am certain that there is no other combination of devices out there that can achieve the same ecosystem.The iOS 15 update, and soon the Mac Monetary update, are expected to take this ecosystem to an even higher league. For instance, and at this particular moment, I can copy the text I am writing on my MacBook and just press paste on my iPad or iPhone and it will paste. I can use my iPad as a secondary screen by pressing a single button. I can create a work routine or a set of actions once I activate Focus Mode, and my devices can even inform people on iMessage that I am busy or not available. I can start a task in one device, work on it somewhere else with another device without the need to login again or try to get access or upload stuff here and there.The ecosystem is indeed a closed system. This can be discouraging for some but it equally creates a chain of cohesive actions that facilitate your daily tasks.I will not talk much about iOS 15 and leave you the pleasure to explore that. Else you can check relevant videos to see the new features.- PrivacyPerhaps one of the main reasons that dragged me towards Apple in general is their emphasis on data protection and privacy. The new Private Relay and Hide my Email features are nothing but evidence on how serious Apple is about privacy. I feel more secure inside this ecosystem and more in control of what I want to share/not share with other parties.- Final Verdict:The final verdict is mixed and conditional. The main thing to say is that the iPhone 13 Pro, like the other flagships in the markets, packs the latest technology available. Whether it is right for you or not depends on how you answer the following:1. Do you own other Apple products? If you already own a MacBook, and iPad, an Apple Watch, or a combination of all then the iPhone would make things even better.2. Do you own an iPhone and you are uncertain about upgrading: If you have an iPhone 11 or lower then I would advise you to upgrade if you can afford the 12 Pro. The major differences would be the battery life, the display, and the cameras. These are MAJOR differences and will make you feel a huge difference. If you own the iPhone 12 Pro I would advise you to not upgrade, unless you really crave the latest technology and cannot live without the new cameras and higher refresh rate. You won't feel a MAJOR difference, but the difference will be noticeable.3. Are you switching from Android to iOS? My short answer will be: If you don't mind a closed system that would function better if you own other Apple products then definitely go for it. The future of privacy and protection seems better with the iPhone (personal view). Plus, with the iPhone you get loads of software updates and Apple will not discontinue their support after two years like most others do. Switching from Android/Windows to Apple is gradual and starts with one device. I started with one device and now own 4 devices that make my life easier.4. Should you go with the mini, the 13, the 13 Pro or the 13 max? If your current phone is smaller than the iPhone 13 and you hate bulky and big devices then go with the mini. If your priority is having the latest all rounder without necessarily flexing in terms of performance then go with the 13. If you want the most iPhones can offer, you game a lot, or you are into photography like me then go with the 13 Pro. If the 13 Pro looks small in your eye and you want something that falls between a smartphone and tablet in terms of size, along with the highest battery capacity possible then consider the 13 Pro Max. But before you decide on this, think about your budget and whether you can afford your preferred phone or not.5. Should you go for the 12 Pro over the 13 Pro? At this particular time NO. The 12 Pro is still expensive and I wouldn't pay that much for it. If you can afford a brand new 12 Pro then save a little more and get a 13 Pro. If you want a 12 Pro wait till January and prices may go lower.6. If you think that the iPhone is expensive then check other brands and you will realise that they are charging the same amount or almost the same amounts without offering the same level of support and updates.I may update this review as I use my phone and discover new stuff. I hope you find this helpful and I hope I managed to assist you in making a decision. I will include samples of pictures taken by my 13 Pro soon, I may also include a video or two.Important: If you read this review and found it helpful you might find my Apple Watch Series 7 review helpful as well. Just click on my profile picture and you will see it as the first review on my profile.

Maybe this will get something done!I am a very very unhappy customer.25th November I contacted customer services as my phone wouldn’t charge or power up at all. I was asked to send my phone together with the PIN number so the repairs team could access my phone and that it would take 14 days from receipt to fix or refund.I duly sent my phone with all the details requested.  Having not heard anything i called to check if it had been received as the status was showing as not yet and the woman confirmed it had been received that morning and would be 14 days from then.On the 13th i realised I still have not heard anything so run an amazon search in my emails and see UK Norwich Amazon come up in the search. I click the email to see if it was connected to the repair and it was an email saying that they had tried to contact me to give them information and as I had not replied they would be sending my phone back to me un repaired via DPD within 3-5 days.I emailed back to say this is the first email I have seen and what was the status of my phone. The response to this was it was not fixed and being sent via Royal Mail. I was very cross about this as not only have I been told different things with regards to timescales (it is at. This point 3 weeks without my phone). I respond to say as much and Gary at Norwich repairs respond highlighting his email saying he said Royal Mail and quite rudely telling me there was no mention of DPD. I responded with the email from Norwich saying DPD two days earlier and asked for a refund as they cannot repair, I was ignored.I contacted amazon directly to try and get this resolved. The first person i speak with, tells me they have escalated to the repairs team and no i cannot speak with a manager because they have left the room. I said I will wait, she put me on hold and then cut me off.  I call back and the man I speak with is more helpful but again the manager he puts me through to tells me, she is going to issue me a refund and confirms my card details and then comes back and says it has to be the repairs team and she has escalated it.I then get an email from Norwich saying my phone has not actually been sent to me yet. Despite it apparently being sent to me four days ago 13th December. The 16th Dec I call and speak directly to Gary and ask for the refund.  Gary said this is not something they can do and that Amazon have misinformed me and that he will reply in an email to say as much.I call Amazon back after Gary sent an email confirming it is no them who issue the refund and the man i speak to tried to help as best he can but again, he asks me to sen him screen shots of the emails which i do but we get no where. He is told to give me this email and; that I am to wait for my broken phone to be sent back to me which is delayed by 4 days already, and over the 14 days for a return or refund, for me to them get back in contact once I receive the broken phone to send it back to you to start this whole process back again.THIS IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH - This is terrible customer service. Please can you just refund me. You have sold me a phone that doesn’t work, i have done as you asked and I do not have the phone, amazon do. I should not be being asked to jump through hoops. I have rights as a consumer and I have requested my refund several times now.Please can you issue me my refund as you are unable to repair the item, you as yet have not sent me the item and I need to go and purchase another.I have been without my phone for 23 days now.Overall I have been sold a dud iPhone and then poor customer service. Am out of pocket by over £1000 and still without my money or my phone.

I hesitated for weeks before placing my order. I had an old iPhone SE that I loved and stubbornly refused to let go, replacing the battery a year ago. But the screen started to glitch in the summer, pink lines everywhere, black stain spreading at the top. Still I could not order a new one as I just did not like them; they seemed way too big. I liked the colour of the iPhone 14 but saw it in store and hated the glass back (fingerprints everywhere). Ended up ordering the 13 pro after watching many videos and I love it. Yes it’s much bigger than the SE but I got used to it in a couple of days. And the colour is beautiful. It is extremely expensive but hopefully I can keep it for years. The pictures taken so far are stunning. I recommend it.

It arrived so fast! I am using the cellphone for two months now and the battery it's good, but as I use it a lot I charge it every day. For me, the highest point is the camera, we get a very good image even with poor light. Also, the velocity to open the apps, change the screen or delete apps and photos is awesome. I really recommend the purchase.

Bought this as a “like new” big discount. It was sent quickly and when it arrived it came in the original package, cable and manuals were even included. To my surprise the device was shiny new, 100% battery health. On settings only shown that it had the rear system had been replaced and it was genuine.

I don't write reviews in general but this time my experience was so bad that I have to review this purchase.As from the headline, I bought three times an iPhone 13 pro, and each time I returned the product because in each case the iPhone was defective.At first, I bought a pre-owned iPhone 13 pro from Amazon Warehouse. The iPhone was in good shape with no scratches at all. Unfortunately, as soon as I switched on the iPhone, I realized the phone was not able to find any mobile network, as if the sim card was not present in the phone. However the sim card was inserted, meaning that this was clearly an issue of the iPhone. It was a Graphite iPhone, whose box is in picture denoted as 1. I understand this is a pre-owned phone and there could be some imperfections, but it is not acceptable that Amazon does not verify if the phone works or not. I guess the quality checks are quite poor if faults like this are not detected before selling the phone.I returned this iPhone and I decided not to trust Amazon Warehouse, so I bought a new one, you can see it in the two pictures denoted as 2. The phone was perfectly working but after a while I noticed a cosmetic imperfection on the camera section. As you can see in the picture, the black circle of the sensor has something like a smear that makes the circle not perfectly circular. I could not have done this damage because the smear is under the glass of the camera. At this point I thought: Why should I keep a defective phone, considering that I paid almost 1000 pounds for it and that, if I want to sell it one day, someone may notice the imperfection and give me less money?I guessed I had been quite unlucky with the two iPhones so I decided to return this second iPhone and to order a third one.The third iPhone 13 pro arrived in the conditions shown in the two pictures denoted as 3. I could not believe it, but there were a small scratch on the upper frame of the phone and some scratches on the grey band on the lateral frame. Notice that these pictures were taken immediately after removing the phone from the box, so I could not have caused these scratches. Again, for the same reasons as the previous one, I did not accept this iPhone and I immediately returned it.At this point my opinion was that it was not me being unlucky, but Apple production/quality check must be very poor and I really lost esteem for this company.At the end I bought a 4th iPhone 13 pro, which fortunately is in good conditions. But during all this procedure of returning and buying iPhones I lost a lot of time and patience and I put a lot of money since I had to buy a new one before the refund for the previous one arrived.I am really unsatisfied both for Amazon Warehouse for the first iPhone and for Apple for the remaining two.

This iPhone is honestly amazing. The battery can last all day and the camera is phenomenal, the colour is beautiful and the screen is really good and charging is really quick as well.You don’t need a 14 pro/14, just buy a 13 pro/13 and you’ll be really happy because the 13 and 14 are literally the same phone but the 13 is cheaper and will last a really long time.Summery the 13 pro is an amazing phone and I recommend this to everyone.
"
2302,B09G98SWCW,5,"
This is my first iPhone and it's been a great experience so far. The phone feels durable and I love the size - I am not a fan of huge phones, so if you are you should consider the pro-max. Would highly recommend.

Very happy with this phone.Is my first iPhone, as I always had Windows Phone and then Android, but now I don't think I could go back.Apple is super pricey so I think I will keep this phone for many years, but generally, I'm happy and the color is stunning.Great battery life, great photos, and videos, very smooth.

Bought for my eldest daughter to replace an iPhone 11 which had a cracked screen (since fixed and that phone now with my youngest daughter). This is a lovely phone and she's over the moon with it - as alwasy Amazon was exceelent, delivery was next day and we've had no problems at all.

Once you’re hooked into the Apple ecosystem they’ve got you - I usually buy new phones every couple of releases/years so came to this from an 11Pro. Incremental updates rather than blow away features. I also buy the handsets sim free and this enables me to have a small £10 per month sim only tariff but it’s swings and roundabouts.

Nice phone but way too overpriced

Get the Pro. I'd never had a Pro before, I didn't see the point. The camera is the point! We all think ""Oh I don't take that many pictures anyway"", you definitely take more than you realise. The quality is stunning, there are so many modes and ways of editing, it's just superb!If anyone is coming from an XS, like me, this one does not have a glass back, I promise. It's titanium I think and properly damage resistant.The battery lasts astonishingly long. I got nearly 2 full days of regular use out of a fully charged 13 Pro battery when I got it.Just brilliant, 100% just spend the extra money and enjoy a quality product :)

Had a trusty iPhone 7 for the past four or five years then battery life dropped off and became near useless for a whole day without chargingUpgraded to the iPhone 13 pro, night and day for the battery, I can easily get two to three days usage. Size is good though slightly bigger than the iPhone 7, weight takes a little get used to. Performance and experience is better though the iOS is the same, overall very happy with the upgrade. Let’s see if it can last 4 or 5 years

Received this phone yesterday. It has a problem with a grey tint on 90% of the screen. Apple advise to return. Amazon refuse to allow me to return until Apple issue a letter of denial, whatever that is. Not sure what to do - - stuck with £1000 phone that doesn’t work and Amazon won’t exchange.Update: went to Apple store, who confirmed that there is a problem and said they would have replaced there and then if I hadn’t bought from Amazon. They did not know what a letter of denial was. Having spoken to a senior Apple engineer, advice was to insist Amazon accept it as a return especially as it’s less than a week old. Phoned  Amazon, very helpful man said he couldn’t action a return as it is a high value item. Am waiting another call….so less than a week, a non working phone and not sure what happens next…But moral is Amazon aren’t good if things go wrong …

Best iPhone ever, until the iPhone 14.The camera is the most impressive feature of the new iPhone 13, it's just insanely good for non-professional use.I think the cinematic mode is a bit gimmicky, but it's fun to play with.

I bought this device to replace a battered second-hand iPhone 11 and I love this phone.The battery life on this phone is exceptional and can easily last a day or even up to 1.5 days depending on usage. With the 120hz refresh rate, you can see the difference in speed and opening up apps in comparison to a 60hz phone.I love to take pictures/random pictures daily and this phone captures amazing photos during the day and the low light photography on this iPhone is one of the best you can get anywhere. The photos come out light, bright and crispyNow, a little negative for some would be the weight of this phone as it weighs just over 200g and can put some weight in your pockets, but it does fit perfectly in pockets/handbags, unlike the bigger 13 Pro Max. But this isn't really a problem for meWould I recommend his phone? hmm, only if you have the budget and absolutely have to have the best of the best tech and battery life. Otherwise, I'd say go with the regular 13 or even the 13 mini

It's pointless to buy iPhones for basically new price after a year... you've already lost nearly 20% of it's supported life (usually about 5-6 years)... so it's actually costing you more, per year, to buy these phones than when new...! irrespective of how nice, fast, how good camera is or how incredibly dated and old-fashioned the entire home screen and 'flow' interface is.

Arrived quickly and packaging was spot on! This phone is bang on!  nice screen quality and very responsive.I’ve upgraded from the iPhone 11 and there’s a great difference in camera quality resolution quality as well although it’s a wee bit chunky this is by far a better phone! A Well recommend upgrade 👍👌

Always had iPhone as they are the best in the business but……..No plug charger with a phone just sort of £1000 and also, I’ve got an iPad Pro and the cables are different connections which is so annoying.Come on Apple, we pay a premium already to buy the best but penny pinching isn’t on!!!

I Didn’t Buy This From Amazon Unfortunately But I Bought It From The Apple Store Itself But I Just Wanted To Put My Experience With The Phone On Here Well First Of All This Phones 120hz I can tell immediately near my iPhone 10And these new cameras are worth the whole 949 pounds I paid and the 128gb is more than enough considering iCloud storage and the colour I hope they keep for next year .

7 years with Samsung, finally got bored of all the hype and broken promises so moved back to apple and pleased to say that I am very happy with it. Android to apple data migration is a pain and still have some issues with basic services due to android placing some sort of plan on my number, who will not help. Annoying. However, this phone is bang on. Every app just works and the cameras (especially recording) are great fun.

I’ve been with Android for 11 years and decided to change to the 13 pro and honestly this phone is unbelievably good. The 120hz display is very fluid and lovely to use, the camera quality is the best I’ve seen on any phone, I love IPhone cameras anyway but this takes it to another level. Also, the speaker quality is so clear and crisp, along with being the loudest I’ve heard on a phone. The Battery life is phenomenal, I can easily get around 9 hours screen on time. Only downsides are it hasn’t got usb c charging and the facial recognition doesn’t work with masks on. Other than that it’s an amazing phone, go and get one, you won’t regret it!

Hi  I would really like to warn everybody about the iPhone 13 Pro as it is really not working properly.  I got the new iPhone 13 Pro just before Christmas and it was very faulty, and EE sent me out a new one, which turns out to be very faulty too.  Since I’ve had new replacement phones now, they will not give me a new phone, but a refurbished one as I am now over the Moth period and this is extremely unfair. As you may, or not be aware of, the Americans are extremely Superstitious and usually they don’t have anything to do with the number 13 and when building they do not have a thirteenth floor in any of their hotels or skyscrapers.  This is why it doesn’t make sense that they brought out the new iPhone as the number 13?  It has been unbelievable and I’ve not had a pleasurable experience with the iPhone13 Pro and I would like to let all those who are extremely superstitious to stay away from this new iPhone and If they do get one, then you’ve all been warned.

I've been using a Pixel 6 Pro and an iPhone 8 as my daily usage phones until I finally decided to buy the iPhone 13 Pro (note: I bought this in a shop, since Amazon had no stock at the time - I bought the Graphite 13 Pro with 256GB storage). I will give my thoughts and experiences from an unbiased view of both an Android and iOS userFirstly, you notice the build quality. This is something Apple has always done really well, and really, nobody else seems to have caught up. It just has such a pleasant feeling holding it hand. No Android phone I've come across in my time (I'm including all flagship phones), have ever managed to replicate that same feeling. I'm talking about holding the phone when it's switched off. It just oozes quality, and I must admit nobody have matched them on this front.The display is the next thing you notice, it's really nice with a crisp display, with high enough pixel density that you cannot see the pixels. I also like the fact the whites seems naturally to be a warmer than my android phones which seem to have a slightly bluer tint to them. Also it's the brightest display I've come across, turning that and the Pixel 6 Pro to max brightness, and there's no competition. If you're the phones side by side in bright daylight, you're definitely going to see the iPhone better.Security unlocking. Previously I've been used to using a finger print sensor. Apple have FaceID, and I must say it's pretty neat, certainly less fuss than fingerprint scanner, especially if you're outside and wearing touch screen compatible gloves. I've noticed you can't have the phone too close to your face though, so a good half arms length away is a minimum. The bigger issue though is in the world of Covid and facemasks, I found it simple doesn't work with a facemask on. I've been told you can work around this by buying an Apple Watch though - but of course that's significant additional cost (plus you might actually prefer a different brand watch).Pros- Very wide aperture (f1.5 main lens) cameras with nice large sensors make for great low light photography- Finally a 3x zoom lens- Lovely display, very nice to look at. Can go very bright, brighter than other phones.- Phone is super responsive, scroll is much smoother than the iPhone 8, and I'd say marginally better than the Pixel 6 Pro in that respect- Magsafe a very nice addition for wireless charging - works really with (so long as you don't use a case or a compatible case)- Battery lasts the whole dayCons- Lacks fingerprint scanner- Face ID not well adapted to the world of facemasks- Protruding camera lens cluster affects usage with some wireless charging stands- Pixel 6 Pro offers 4x zoom lens, rivalling picture quality and neat exclusive AI photo processing for significantly less money. (But that phone's not perfect either)- Still uses lightning adaptor for charging as opposed to USB-CIssues with in general I found migrating from Android to iOS, not necessarily iPhone 13 Pro specifically- Whatsapp won't (at time of writing) transfer chat history from Android to iOS, requires paying for 3rd party solutionNote I've put a screen protector and camera lens protector on it from new. Also, I use a case, so these might show in some of the pictures.Summary:At £949 for the base model, you get a very nice premium product. However on balance, in my opinion it's not a clear winner vs the Pixel 6 Pro which I've been using day to day along side it.If you are already Apple invested and you're running an iPhone 11 or older, then it's a clear purchase - it's probably not worth your hassle converting to android for the current offerings at this time.If you have a recent flagship Android phone, again I wouldn't recommend switching over to iOS just for this phone. (I took the plunge because my car only supports CarPlay and I was replacing an iPhone 8).If you have an iPhone 12, then it's a tough call. Yes it's a better camera, but is it enough to justify the huge cost of upgrade? - I probably wouldn't.Overall, it's a really good phone with an outstanding camera, but it's not perfection

How can a phone cost over £1000 and you don't get no charger or headphone in the box

Upgraded from an iPhone 6s. Massive upgradeBattery lasts for a day.Screen is amazing.Speakers are louder and clearer.Phone is slightly thicker and with square edges can dig in fingers as it’s a bigger phone than the 6s. But a good case will sort this.  Done get this wrong the phone looks amazing so worth the design choiceChose this over the max as you can still use this one handed.Invest in a fast charger as Charing with the old iPhone chargers takes forever. If you charge overnight then no problem but on that rare occasion the battery is low the old charger will feel like an eternity to charge

I’ve moved from an XR; decent enough all rounder but still average battery life and a mediocre camera.This is almost the same size but noticeably heavier but it feels so much more “ premium.”Battery life is at least doubled and the camera really is outstanding. I’m no pro but attached a macro and a sunset shot just to show off it’s capabilities.I got the 256GB for the additional video feature which I’ve yet to use.A superb piece of kit protected by an OtterBox Strava folio case; also superb.

With the exception of some small differences the iPhone 13 Pro looks much the same as last year’s iPhone 12 Pro, but internally it’s a different story as it’s here where improvement have been made to the:- Camera- Camera features- Display- Chip/Performance- BatteryCameraThe iPhone 13 Pro has 3 camera lenses, a:1. Wide Camera lens2. Telephoto lens with a x0.5 to x3 optical zoom and a x15 digital zoom.3. Ultra-Wide Camera lens, which for the first time has macro mode:  The ability to take photos or video just 2cm awayCamera featuresThe iPhone 13 Pro has:1. Photographic Styles2. Cinematic modePhotographic Styles are 5 pre-set warmth and tones settings which can be further adjusted if you want.  The pre-sets are ‘Standard’, ‘Rich-Contrast’, ‘Vibrant’, ‘Warm’ and ‘Cool’.Cinematic mode like portrait mode focusses on a subject – either automatically or manually – blurring out the background… and can be refocussed onto another subject if they too come into frame.  The idea is to give a more professional feel to video much like a professional camera, and it is a lot of fun to use, but for more serious camera work it’s not perfect.DisplayAnother new feature to the Pro model is ProMotion.ProMotion is an adaptive display which automatically changes from 10Hz to 120Hz depending on what you’re doing or looking at.  Unfortunately, there are almost no games which can use the 120Hz display but this will change in time… although it is currently noticeable when scrolling quickly between screens or images/text.Chip/PerformanceApple’s new A15 bionic chip is in all the iPhone 13 models.  A 6-core CPU with a 5-core GPU in the Pro models, compared to a 4-core GPU in the regular iPhone 13.  To get straight to the point, the A15 bionic chip is currently the fastest smartphone chip in the world… meaning can comfortably handle the most demanding processes and apps… and still has room to spare!The A15 bionic chip also means Apple will continue support the iPhone 13 range with software (iOS) updates for the next 5-6 years, longer than any other smartphone manufacture.  Meaning it’s ideal for anyone looking to future proof their phone.In addition there is also 6Gb of RAM.BatteryThe battery has been fantastic.  I’m not a heavy phone user, so I’m comfortably getting through the day and often into the next the next day without needing to charge it – although this varies depending on what I’m doing.However, when you look at what the battery is supporting – an improved camera, features, display and a faster chip…. it’s very good.SummaryThe iPhone 13 Pro is an extremely well-engineered phone and what it does, it does well.  If you want or need a telephoto lens, macro mode or the fastest possible smartphone chip out there.  Then get the iPhone 13 Pro.

I decided (Jan 23) that my old iPhone 6s was nearing the end of its life - Apple have decided to stop software updates for it going forward and my concern, now that I use banking apps, was as much about security as anything else. Amazon had £50 off so I bought an iPhone 14 128GB.Amazon delivered it as described - they send you a secure 6 digit code when it's out for delivery to read back to the driver - worked fine.I swapped my old O2 nano sim - non US iPhone 14s as of writing still come with a physical sim slot. Worked immediately. I used the Quick Start wizard to transfer everything from the old phone (had to restart old phone at the start of the process to get it to work). I was pleasantly surprised how well this worked.I won't repeat the many reviews of the phone as they're well documented but immediately I am impressed with its speed, clarity of display, how well Face ID works, the camera, battery life etc.I suspect I will keep it until Apple stop supporting it (7 years??) so very happy.

I’m a big gamer so the fact that games like Genshin work super well on the 14 is a bonus for me. The adjustments from android hasn’t been that hard, but I’m not use to a lot of stuff. This review is going off having a Google pixel not an iPhone before this though so what others are saying about the phone being a iPhone 11 Pro I dunno much about. All I can say it’s better than my old phone with a clearer screen, and I love how it connects to my iPad (important to me as an digital artist.)Battery is amazing, again big gamer so the fact I only charge my phone every two days, In love with. My old phones would be every night and as it got older twice a day without gaming. The colour is a bonus too, love purple.I would go off about price. I’m using Amazon payments, but a lot of companies charge this much for a phone, and SE is best bet if you don’t want your phone to do fancy stuff. I personally wanted good camera , good screen and, gaming. That’s what I’m paying for. :)One thing I’d like is to move my music across without a pc. Haven’t found a way yet, so I just download both google music and iTunes.

Had to get an upgrade from my IPhone 12. Couldn’t be more happier with this phone as of right now. Had it for 3 months now and is still running greatly. The battery life has surprised very much as I have left it in charge for too long on the occasion and it hasn’t effected the max battery charge at all. The 5g is great, camera is fantastic and the systems work to a good standard. Great product

I was due an upgrade from my iPhone 10. And after reading reviews I was unsure if to go for this or iPhone 13 Pro. Glad I went for this. Compared to previous versions this phone is quicker. Battery life is better then previous version of iPhone. Camera quality is good. Overall happy with the purchase. It is a bit on the pricey side. I would recommend it.

This is the first time I've ever been up to date with my iPhone. I started with a 6s when the 8 was out and had a XR when the 12 was introduced. At the time of getting the 6s I didn't really have much use for a mobile but I could see they'd become more useful in the years ahead. And now my wife and I used them for almost everything from shopping to ordering our medications, the list goes on. So I wanted an Apple phone that was up to date knowing it would last me, or maybe outlast me, for years. And I love my 14. My grandson said I should have got the pro max and gone for the bigger screen. But this fits in the back pocket of my jeans perfectly. Its also the quickest iPhone I've ever used. So I love it and can heartily recommend it to anyone who, like me doesn't want a fashion statement but a phone that does all you need it to.

2420,B0BDJH7J5C,4,"
A great phone with long battery life and fab camera. The only ‘fault’ is that the SOSEmergency alarm went off while I was driving over a bridge which had regular bumps, was curved and in the traffic was driven at quite a speed. The phone was resting in a cup holder and so was shaken so much the alarm went off and we received a phone call to see if the emergency services needed to be called. The alarm itself was so loud it made me jump. So now I make sure the phone is safely held down.  Otherwise it’s a brilliant bit of kit.

Very pleased with my purchase and glad I went and  got it, oh and feels nice to use hold and use aswell, not had it long but so far can't fault anything with it.

Don't believe me? see how similar they are on gsmarena.Notice how the iPhone has barely evolved since the 10?You get the original design, 4 style design, the 6 style design and 10 style design. That’s only 4 design styles over the years.I tested this iPhone and found the camera is shockingly bad especially for closeup pics, gets blurry when my old 6s could’ve taken closeup pics easily and they were sharp.the iPhone 14 'pro' is the true iPhone 14 you could say, the next step in the evolution of these iPhones considering the dynamic island feature. Seriously, what was the point of the iPhone 14? It's more pointless production and needless waste of resources.If they really want to release a phone every year the changes need to be significant. 14 looks the same as 13 and before. Notch improved? That’s not enough to warrant a whole new phone. The innovation is so lazy, slow and conservative.Meanwhile, Samsung are now in folding phones territory where I think the trend should go next.Speaking of releases I don’t think it’s necessary to release a phone every year. A phone is a phone. I was using my 6s this year and still was doing the business for me so it’s pointless and a waste of resources to spew out phones every year. How many more phones are they going to churn out every year when its clear the iPhone series is plateauing? Makes me wonder what the iPhone 57,485,007,327 will look like, lol (I dread to imagine a future like that and how many landfills exist of old discarded phones, rotting and destroying habitats, but i digress).And given the current cost of living crisis, who in their right mind can afford an iPhone these days when many of us in the real world are having to make decisions like heating or eating? Apple say its 'only' 800 quid or whatever (charging British consumers more than the americans), as if thats cheap - mate, i can get a smartphone for less than 100 off ebay that can still do the same stuff the 14 can do - calls, pics, music, internet, youtube. Apple is SO out of touch with reality and what people can really afford.Before you react with your emotional responses - no, I'm not a fan of samsung. Or apple. or sony. or microsoft. or google. or amazon. or facebook. or whatever-big-company-entity you can think of.What's the point of this product?
"
2443,B0BDJH7J5C,4,"
This is such a disappointment, it’s marginally better than an iPhone 12 and 13.Is it a good phone? Yes, it’s fabulous.Is it worth buying? Absolutely not.Save up for the pro with the newly designed island, excellent new camera and more powerful processor as the basic 14 is pointless. The 14 max maybe an option if you want something bigger but… overall? A completely underwhelming release, and still no usb-c. Come on apple, sort yourselves out, this is the laziest designed iPhone in years.

2444,B0BDJH7J5C,3,"
This is a great phone in almost all respects but coming from a 2016 SE this thing is huge, too wide, too thick. I am over 6 ft with massive paws but find it difficult to use with one hand without the constant risk of dropping it.  I erred for a while whether to get the newest or the 13 mini and assumed as they no longer make the mini it wouldn’t a problem. Well apple, if you are reading this, size matters and after a few weeks I’m slightly regretting my choice.
"
2445,B0BDJH7J5C,2,"
A price hike AND the same processor as last year?! (Yes, I know there is one extra GPU). Thanks, I will pass Apple, and get the 13 when I upgrade.

iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are stripped down iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max's. These are no different than the iPhone 13 from 2021 as the internals are the exact same, all they did was take the A15 Bionic chip out of the 13 Pro/Max and that is literally it. Hence, making it a stripped down, knock-off version of the 13 Pro/Max.iPhone 13 Pro/Max is the better phone and better value for money. It has a 120Hz refresh rate display which makes everything look very smooth and responsive, a much better camera system, better battery life, Stainless Steel build instead of the cheap Aluminium. You have to be a clown to willingly buy the 14 and 14 Plus. iPhone 14 is a rip off version of 13 Pro and 14 Plus is a rip off of 13 Pro Max, while making worse at the same time.Don't waste your money on this trash as it was made to be a quick cash grab from Apple. You'll be able to find a 13 Pro Max 256GB for less than a 14 Plus 256GB.If you don't want the 13 Pro/Max, buy a 13 instead at a discounted price. Just don't be the clown that Apple wants you to be and buy the 14/Plus.BUY THE 13 PRO OR 13 PRO MAX, NOT THIS. DO NOT BUY THE iPHONE 14/14 PLUS

... but at £850+  ?? What's the extra money paying for. I figure, for your basic decent phone, £300 is a rough ballpark. Although I love apple products, typing this on my Mac right now, I don't need to phone someone so bad that I'd pay £850. In fact, I'll just not get this, and won't bother calling anyone. Ever. Thanks, Apple, you turned me into a misanthrope.

Don't. Don't even bother adding the phone to your wish list. Don't even add to cart.The iPhone 14 is literally leftover scraps of the iPhone 13, same specs same everything -Hey, who even wants a 7 inch screen? You might aswell get an iPad or Laptop if you're planning to get a phone BIGGER THAN YOUR HEAD. Period. Don't. The most wasteful £1,000 you can ever spend. Just get an iPhone 13 or below - the safety features even require a subscription? - I am NOT going to pay for a life or death situation, thanks.Please, save yourself and just get a different phone. This is Apple's biggest fail.

The ‌iPhone 14‌'s upgrades over the ‌iPhone 13‌ are questionable. This isn’t an upgrade. It’s literally a repackaged iPhone 13! There are no improvements that make it a worthy purchase. Do yourself a favour. Save £850 by not buying it!

Je suis passe du samsung S22 Ultra que je trouvais trop grand et lourd en main a iphone 14 et je suis très content, oui je sais vous allez dire passer de android à Apple c’est juste pas possible mais détrompez vous moi par exemple en même pas 1 semaine je me suis fait et en venant de android depuis plus de 15 ans donc…niveau batterie je tiens 24h en passant plusieurs heures sur tiktok navigation internet spotify etc et j’ai remarqué un réel gain de plusieurs heures niveau batterie comparé au Samsung S22 ultra aussi en 60hz. J’ai une moyenne de 9h écran allumée en 24h Apple c’est beaucoup amélioré niveau autonomie j’en suis très content je le recommande a 1000%, il est ni petit ni grand juste parfait, charge via câble 1h40 ok vous allez dire c’est long il y a mieux mais voila je tiens 24h et il me reste minimum 20% de batterie donc je suis tranquille. J’espère avoir aidé car moi j’ai beaucoup hésité venant de android mais j’en suis vraiment pas déçu j’en suis même très très content voila voila

Die Kritik, dass sich so wenig zum Vorgänger getan hat kann ich nicht so ganz nachvollziehen. Ich kaufe mir doch auch kein neues Auto, wenn es Facelift ansteht, sondern warte auf den direkten Nachfolger. Das iPhone 14 ist Modellpflege vom 12er und 13er was man auch direkt am Aussehen erkennen kann. Ich bin vom 11er auf das 14er gesprungen und merke schon deutliche Unterschiede.+ super Verarbeitung+ edles Design ohne spürbare Kanten oder Spalte+ Display ist sehr gut verarbeitet und hell+ das iOS. Das Herzstück wie immer DER Kaufgrund für ein iPhone. Ich habe neben diverser Apple Geräte so ziemlich alle Betriebsysteme der letzten Jahre und Hersteller durch. Daher will ich auch keine Grundsatzdiskussion vom Zaun brechen. Für mich ist Apples System die Speerspitze.  Wenn man nun noch mehrere Geräte aus dem Apple Universum benutzt steigert sich das Ganze sogar noch und man hat ein Biotop was genialer nicht sein kann.+ Kamera und die neuen Videofunktionen sind sehr gut. Wer hier kritisiert, dass Apple keine 60 oder 120MP hat dem sei gesagt: Schaut euch die BIlder im Vergleich an. Mehr Pixel heißt nicht besser! Aber mit irgendetwas muss man ja punkten, wenn es schon nicht das Betriebsystem ist+ der Transfer der Daten vom alten Telefon zum neuen Gerät. Wie immer simpel, schnell und genial einfach- Preis

Dieses Gerät ist für Leute, die ein sehr sehr hochwertiges Handy haben wollen genau das richtige. Das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis ist zwar fraglich, aber man bekommt eben ein extrem hochwertiges Gerät. Für ältere Personen ist dieses Smartphone eher gewöhnungsbedürftig und nicht zu empfehlen, da die Bedienung über wischen und streichen erfolgt. Für Leute, die jedoch damit gut umgehen können, ist das Handy perfekt. Auch die Kamera geht fast nicht besser. Alles in allem ein perfektes Produkt zu einem etwas teuren Preis, aber wer Apple kauft und damit ein sehr hochwertiges Gerät bekommen möchte, muss eben auch mit so einem Preis leben.

Bin vom 12er auf das iPhone 14 in Product-Red umgestiegen weil ich für  mich persönlich einen - wenn auch geringen - Mehrwert gesehen habe, der mir die 999 Euro einfach wert war. Allein schon die Verdoppelung des Einstiges-Speicherplatzes von immer knappen 64 auf für mich üppige 128 GB war mir den Aufpreis wert. Auch die wesentlich verbesserte Reparaturfreundlichkeit (bin diesbezüglich leider ein gebranntes Kind) ist sehr schön, da sich die Glas-Rückwand nun einzeln und rel. günstig austauschen lässt. Das geht bei den teuren Pro-Modellen leider nicht! Erstaunt war ich auch, wie gut ich mein altes iPhone 12 noch verkaufen konnte - das ist für mich ein grundsätzlicher und nicht zu unterschätzender Vorteil der Apple-Handys. Von mir deshalb volle 5 Sterne!

Nach über 20 Jahre Android, auf Empfehlung umgestiegen auf IPhone 14, das war aber dann doch nicht das gelbe vom Ei!alles nicht so Optimal wie man das gewohnt ist, kein Fingerscann dafür Gesichtserkennung aber nur für eine Person was sehr schlecht ist.Die meisten App von Android gibt es auch im Apple Store allerdings bei Android Kostenlos bei Apple  nur ein paar Tage zum Testen dann muss man Zahlen.Bedienung sehr Kompliziert, man kommt sich vor wie bei einer Putzkolonne wischen schieben, es fehlt das waschen!Ladebuchse immer noch Apple eigen, man hat noch nichts gehört von USB C, habe ich bei meinem Android schon seid 3 Jahren.Und nun soll man dafür soviel Geld bezahlen  für was, für den Glauben es wäre etwas besseres, nein Danke.Ist schon auf dem Wege zurück!!!

Ist ja bei Apple nichts neues aber hier merkt man wirklich null Unterschied zu älteren Modellen. Habe nachdem mein 12er kaputt gegangen ist das hier gekauft und es ist schon ziemlich dreist: man merkt wirklich Null Unterschied in der Handhabung und die Kamera ist auch nicht bemerkbar besser. Ganz im Gegenteil sogar, mit dem neuen ios habe ich viel mehr bugs und Aufhänger, dee Akku scheint auch kürzer zu halten. Im großen und ganzen ist es ein super Handy (ios>android), wenn man so viel Geld für ein Hand ausgeben will ok, ich würde aber eher ein älteres Modell kaufen.

I, like everyone else considering this product, was a bit wary of ordering a renewed phone instead of a new one, without seeing it first anyway. However, upon arrival & first look the phone is in impeccable condition! Everything seems to work as it should and the screen, edges, cameras etc are all free from any signs of use. I do however have two criticisms. The first, is that the battery health is only at 83%. My old iPhone is better than that at around 91/92! Still, it’s a second hand phone and it works. It’s really not the end of the world. It does it’s job and seems fine.My main issue was the delivery. When I heard that the phone was being sent through Evri my heart sank. I’ve lost so many parcels with them lately, this is actually the first parcel I’ve ever had arrive in one piece from them. The parcel was lost, then turned up again, then lost again, delayed, and finally arrived a week after it was due and then thrown over my 6ft garden fence. Luckily however, the phone is in one piece. I would just urge the seller to reconsider who they are using to send these devices.I would gladly buy another device from this company when the time comes, but not if Evri are taking anything to do with it.

My battery life was 85% , I thought it was too bad for having taken the excellent one... He thought he should specify more details, especially about battery life. :(

2540,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
I had been waiting iPhone 14 to be released before deciding which phone to go for. I would normally buy the latest phone unlocked and choose the best monthly rolling sim option. However, after weighing up the cost and functionality (iPhone 14 seemed a marginal functionality improvement at significantly increased cost), I came to the conclusion that a renewed iPhone 12 pro max offered much better value at around half the price. I choose the 'excellent condition' and have been very pleased with the result - especially as this is the first time I have taken this route. I have had the phone from Phones Direct for almost a month now and there have been no issues. There were no scratches/blemishes. The battery health was 87% and has remained so (the guarantee is >80%). I would have liked more (who wouldn't!) but it hasn't been an issue. Would definitely recommend

I was wary about going for a refurbished phone after reading reviews about other so called market leading companies, however the feedback on this company made me take the plunge and I’m glad I did.  Quick delivery and the condition is as good as out of the box new but at massive discount, battery maximum capacity is 86% which is not an an issue.  The added bonus was the 12 month interest free payment option which was quick and easy to set up.  I kept my current unlimited data contract so it was a simple switch over of the SIM once the phones had synchronised with each other, it’s so easy these days!  I’ve estimated a saving over 2 years of around £700 compared with getting a refurbished phone of this specification from my service provider.  Bargain!

2545,B08PCCKHJM,4,"

I am absolutely shocked and appalled by the service and product that has been provided to me. I bought this phone as a Grade A iPhone 12 Pro Max, fully refurbished. I used this phone for around 2 months before it became completely unusable. I was using my phone as normal, when one day the screen just stopped working entirely. I thought maybe it was just a glitch and did everything that usually fixes the problem, restart, update etc. But nothing worked.I contacted Clover Mobiles and sent my phone off to be repaired; they refused to cooperate unless I payed a further £325 for a new screen, which was not even damaged at all. They didn't bother to look at the phone at all and decided the fault was due to a drop because there was a minor blemish on the corner of the phone. I decided to do some research myself and the component that processes touch on the phone, called a digitiser, cannot be broken simply from a drop on this model of phone. This proves Clover did nothing to look at the product or even try and find a solution.To make matters worse, I then spoke to an Amazon member of staff who informed me I can get a full refund for the entire amount of the product; I was extremely happy to hear this only for the horrendous staff at Clover to inform me that if I send the phone back they will just send it straight back to me. Amazon have let me down by saying I will be getting a full refund, only to be turned down by the seller. The phone even has a 1 year return policy if it doesn't work, which it doesn't!So after hearing this, I decided to look inside the phone to see if anything is loose or broken inside, which I could not break myself. And the inside of the phone is in such poor condition; there is soldering work that is so poorly done and the back of the screen, has a rip, I assume (like Clover Mobiles do), from a previous repair on the phone. Please see the images above and I implore you not to buy a product from these sellers, I do not want anyone else in the same situation.

2549,B08PCCKHJM,4,"
Phone has a fault when on calls the volume cuts down very low.  The company are happy to change it but unlike if you purchase direct from Apple they will not send you a replacement to transfer your pictures music etc over before having to send back.  Bare this in mind it could be worth paying the extra to Apple as in warranty service is the best ever.

2553,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
Good quality product
"
2554,B08PCCKHJM,4,"
The physical condition was excellent but the battery health was only 82% which was a little disappointing for the premium price paid.
"
2555,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
Straight out of the packaging this phone looks like it’s NEW, not a mark on it!Battery life shows at 100% 😲So far it seems to be working perfectly!Comes with 1 year warranty, too! 🧐Excellent value for money on this refurbished phone 😁Absolutely recommended!
"
2556,B08PCCKHJM,4,"
GOOD
"
2557,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
Battery life is 87% but still ok for me. No single scratch on the phone. It looks good as new. Face recognition function perfectly. Will definitively recommend this phone to friends and family.
"
2558,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
The phone arrived and it’s absolutely stunning. No apparently marks whatsoever. Everything works perfectly. The battery life is at 88%. Looks like brand new if it had arrived in the original box.
"
2559,B08PCCKHJM,4,"
You can never go wrong with an Apple item, but the seller is highly recommended

I was pleasantly surprised by this phone which was sent by Phones Direct Uk. I have been using it for almost a week now and have encountered absolutely no issues. Battery health was at 90% which I can’t really complain about. As for the actual body of the phone itself, it came in perfect condition, no marks or scratches at all on any part of the phone. Speakers work perfectly, as well as touchscreen, cameras, face ID, etc. I would definitely recommend buying refurbished through Amazon for a fair price, rather than the extortionate prices charged elsewhere. Less than £700 for what looks and acts like a brand new iPhone that is a fairly recent release. I know through Amazon Marketplace phones are sent from different individual companies so I cannot speak for all, but I am very happy with the phone I’ve received.

Bought for someone else in the house. He seems to be pleased with it and that's the main thing.

Great phone !! Battery health is very low

Great value, perfect condition phone battery 80%. Very prompt delivery, well packaged and came with a charging cable. Would recommend
"
2570,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
Not a mark on it for a renewed product.
"
2571,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
In a nutshell, the iPhone 12 pro max I bought is like a new phone. I never purchased a second-hand phone before, I have no regrets about buying this one I’m planning to buy another phone from the seller again. I hereby recommend this seller, I never believed that second-hand phones would be in that excellent condition.
"
2572,B08PCCKHJM,3,"
Battery health is not good it’s just  83% it was bit disappointing. They should write’s exact battery health.
"
2573,B08PCCKHJM,4,"
This is my first ever Iphone and so far I have been okay with it,I got a very good condition barely used phone and no damages or marks around it ( might got lucky)everything is currently working as it should, Yes it's high on price but still its Apple sadly
"
2574,B08PCCKHJM,3,"
Unfortunately the phone sides were scratched deeply . The screen and back were clear though . It seemed that the previous owner had been a bit careless .The scratches were deep enough to be felt and the metallic rim felt as though it was rusted ??I used first class mail to return the iPhone , cost me 5.5 £ , the seller only refunded the phone cost even though it was clearly mentioned that the return cost will be refunded as well .The phone had not been cleaned either .Though battery was working as advertised and phone didn't have any other obvious defect .Over all a poor experience on Amazon and by the seller .Will stick to first hand goods only in future .
"
2575,B08PCCKHJM,4,"
Very disappointed with this phone And seller I have been through customer live chat I get nowhere avoid at all costs
"
2576,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
For so many purpose we used phone for.
"
2577,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
It’s great value for money
"
2578,B08PCCKHJM,4,"
I actually didn’t realise the phone was a used renewed phone when I bought it, thought it was brand new but either way it came in immaculate condition with no visible signs of use. Hopefully there aren’t any problems as time goes by! But for now very good
"
2579,B08PCCKHJM,2,"
I'm going to keep it short and sweet - Ordered three phones from three different vendors, each supposedly in ""excellent condition"". First one had a severely deteriorated battery apparently, second had a bizarre screen fitted that was definitely not Apple. Maybe it was pear. Third has chips all around the bezel and the PVC coating has worn away. Note: the last two also had battery lives of 80% and 83%. If this is excellent quality, what do you get with ""acceptable"" - The bezel alone?
"
2580,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
Face recognition is so easy and much better security than I’ve had previously. I’ve never been an iPhone fan but my husband bought me this and I must admit I love everything about it.
"
2581,B08PCCKHJM,4,"
a few small insignificant scratches, great quality for price pleased with it and do recommend.
"
2582,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
An excellent product from a good seller
"
2583,B08PCCKHJM,3,"
First time buying a refurbished phone. Look like a new!! Ordered yesterday received today. Easy set up. Can’t wait to write this review.  Will keep you updated after a few months’ use.After a month, not sure about the screen. It’s dull although brightness is adjust to 90%.Sometimes the screen keeps flipping when I press my finger on certain app. Don’t know why.
"
2584,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
I've had this product for one week now. Battery came at 89% after a few days usage it went to 88%. But, it still lasts me all day! It's a big change for me as I've had an iPhone 8 Plus over the past couple of years. I was quite skeptical about ordering this product but I took the risk and I'm happy so far! :) Really wanted to buy a iPhone 12 Pro Max outright at a good price and it's great that it can be returned within a year!They delivered it within a day. No major scratches on the phone, it was just dirty around the camera lenses and in the mute button. Everything else is brilliant so far, the back and front camera quality is amazing! I have no other complaints, will update this review over the coming months.
"
2585,B08PCCKHJM,4,"
I turned it on and it worked like an iphone so we chilling
"
2586,B08PCCKHJM,4,"
Upgraded from 11 pro. Generally I knew what to expect. The only issue was a little scratch on the screen but fine otherwise. Came in MusicMagpie box though.
"
2587,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
My wife has serious phone envy when she sees the photos I take on my iPhone 12 Pro Max and the way it syncs with my iPad. So, being the loving husband I decided to buy her the same phone, but refurbished to save hundreds of pounds on what I paid for mine new about 9 months ago.I was almost put off by the reviews on here, but decided to buy as I knew I could return the phone if it was damaged in any way.I made the right decision and my wife is delighted. The phone looks like it is new and has 100% battery life. Mega brownie points for me.And the 1 year warranty is fantastic.We just have to see now who can take the best photos with our top of the range iPhones.
"
2588,B08PCCKHJM,4,"
Nice
"
2589,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
I was worried about spending £600 on a reconditioned phone, but after reading reviews on the seller went for a iphone 12 max pro.Phoned arrived in good time, package was basic, with charging cable, plug, and card removal pin.Phone is spotless, looks brand new with no visible marks at all... screen is also totally mark free, all systems working fine, and the battery is saying its at 98% chargeable to its max level. All in all very happy with my purchase.
"
2590,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
When I received my new phone, they included a charger which apple don’t do, a 100 percent battery life. It was worth buying.
"
2591,B08PCCKHJM,4,"
88% battery capacity when it arrived, surely for a refurbed unit put a new one in.
"
2592,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
I never write reviews but..... Brand new phone, not even a single scratch. Very pleased with this product. I would never buy an iphone from an Apple Store again! Good for your pocked and for the planer as well! Fast delivery comes with the essentials. I'll get back with a battery life review after 6 months. If you still wonder whether to buy it or now, go ahead, you won't regret it!
"
2593,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
Amazing phone at a great price… immaculate condition and battery health was 95%
"
2594,B08PCCKHJM,4,"
I just got this phone delivered to me yesterday.For the money i spent i can say it is in a decent shape.It has some scratches on the screen which are pretty visible, on the sides as well.Overall i am quite happy with the product, it came with 96% battery so i dunno.Delivery was ok too.
"
2595,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
So far so good “….
"
2596,B08PCCKHJM,2,"
Battery was 88 % this is 3 years worth of useI recommend battery replacement , i contacted the seller and they were happy if its over 80%I wish to be considered for a replacement with a better battery health same condition though
"
2597,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
So the Iphone came the next day i made the purchase.90% Battery Life, honestly no scratch and including things on the photo (charger plug, cable and a voucher… also the phone). If this is a second hand phone, shows then that previous owner used to keep it with case and protector (same as me) so happy for the purchase.I would have preferred signed delivery from Royal Mail maybe (as it is an expensive parcel), but if you organize well yourself, you can pick it up quickly.Hope this helps
"
2598,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
I’ve been using the phone for a few weeks now, and it is much better than I thought it would be. I upgraded from the 7 plus, and was very pleased at the quality of the phone when it arrived. There were no scratches, and the battery was 92% of a brand new phone (the description said it would guarantee 80%). I definitely saved a lot of money!
"
2599,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
I am really impressed with the value of the phone I received! I was a bit sceptical at first knowing that it was a refurbished iPhone however once I received my package I was overjoyed with what I had been given! The phone looks almost brand new! No scratches on the screen, the sides are in perfect condition and the back is immaculate!! The battery health on the phone is 92% which ofc isn’t perfect but the phone still last well over a day, and I’d say I use my phone moderately to high amount!!I got the iPhone 12 Pro Max Blue 256GB two days after I ordered it! Even though it said it would take about a week!10/10 for this! Very impressed!
"
2600,B08PCCKHJM,3,"
Cannot fault the quality of the device itself, looks like new! However, the phone comes with a Lighting>USBC cable but a USB A adapter, so that’s not very helpful, could be wrong? The other thing was that the phone came with 0% battery so couldn’t turn it on for a while and I thought something was wrong with it at first as I had it on charge for 30 minutes before it seemed to come into life?!Lastly, delivery - you cannot choose Amazon locker and DPD just left it on the floor outside the house which is pretty crazy considering the cost of it
"
2601,B08PCCKHJM,4,"
This good for value
"
2602,B08PCCKHJM,2,"
The phone is not that good bro and I payed 630 the battery life is not good
"
2603,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
The phone looked absolutely mint basically brand new can’t complain really really happy with my purchase as a 1 year warranty with Amazon renewal great scheme would 100% buy from this device and the company who sold it again
"
2604,B08PCCKHJM,2,"
side of the furniture with a lot of scratches
"
2605,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
I Was dubious about spending £700 on a used phone but after receiving this flagship iPhone, I couldn’t be happier. Face recognition works perfectly, battery health is 100…… yes 100%, and the phone itself is near perfect. One tiny scratch on the top edge. That’s it, apart from an even smaller scratch on the screen that I’ll never even notice. I only saw it while I was scrutinising the whole phone. In addition, you get an Apple adapter (unlike with a new iPhone).Amazon renewed from now on for my next iPhone.
"
2606,B08PCCKHJM,3,"
Unfortunately the phone was received with a crack in the corner on the screen. Easy to miss unless viewed at an angle in daylight. We all make mistakes. Apart from that excellent service and fantastic iPhone.
"
2607,B08PCCKHJM,2,"
Received phone with only 82% capacity, very disappointed.
"
2608,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
There’s always a little bit of trepidation when buyingSomething second hand but this time very happy with the phone . No marks scratches whatsoever just looks like new with a massive saving.
"
2609,B08PCCKHJM,2,"
Having ordered several renewed phones from Amazon. I might give it a miss from now on as suppliers are now supplying phones with the battery at 81% health. My older iPhone 8+ has a better life than that and this newer model was purchased to replace it. But as the Amazon rule is 80% some suppliers are using this to their advantage to get shot of their stock.  The phone was quite dirty when delivered but no visible scratches which was probably the only bonus.  If you up for a game of chance go for it but ideally I’ll go somewhere where I can visibly see the product before purchase.
"
2610,B08PCCKHJM,4,"
I do like this phone and the great price I paid for it. However it’s too big and starts to hurt your hand after a while and my hands are bigger than the phone!
"
2611,B08PCCKHJM,3,"
Everything is okay apart from screen scratch which is quite noticeable. it might not affect your use but still there.
"
2612,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
I absolutely love my iPhone 12 Pro Max.The battery life is not as much good but overall fine . Fantastic camera.
"
2613,B08PCCKHJM,1,"
Bought IPhone 12 Pro Max as a present for a relative. Supposedly grade A condition, come with large very noticeable scratch. Tried using portrait mode on camera which would go completely black and not work and then also not let any other option be selected on the camera to take a normal photograph. When receiving a call the phone would completely freeze and not work to the point of having to reset the whole phone and set up as new. Thought with being a grade A it would be fine to buy refurbished but I would 100% advise anyone to not buy second hand or from this seller.
"
2614,B08PCCKHJM,2,"
Came with a few scratches but most thing I don’t like how it’s screen has been polished poorly to get rid of its scratches not the best pleased but have it under a screen protector so don’t see it but you’d think for the amount of money you spend you’d think it would be better musicmagpie I wouldn’t rate 👎🏻
"
2615,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
Face recognition seems to be working as it should be, battery life was 100% when I bought the first time and now is 97% I haven’t had any issues with this one whatsoever and also great price, I would definitely recommend this one phone.
"
2616,B08PCCKHJM,1,"
IPhone kept freezing when coming out standby / sleep had to return phone, dealer delayed refund after 3 weeks of waiting had to get Amazon involved to sort out refund
"
2617,B08PCCKHJM,3,"
Sent back not what I wonted
"
2618,B08PCCKHJM,3,"
Not the right charger … come in the paper box … my screen have a line on the screen ….
"
2619,B08PCCKHJM,1,"
Face ID didn't work on the iPhone, I received today. Even though it was described as in excellent condition... Can't trust the seller:( It is a lottery whether you'll get a good one or with an issue like in my case.
"
2620,B08PCCKHJM,1,"
Camera had many faults including a black dot on screen when using the 2.5x lens. This would appear in every photo taken using that lens. Also, reflections would occur on images as seen in image two with the cat. This is not acceptable on a £660 phone. The battery capacity was at 89% when received and although this is not the worst it could be (as stated they sell phones with up to 80% capacity), this combined with the faulty camera really made the phone not acceptable. I would strongly recommend not buying this product.
"
2621,B08PCCKHJM,3,"
This mobile has heating problem and battery life is not so good.
"
2622,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
Good product , very impressed & does the job
"
2623,B08PCCKHJM,1,"
Bought this phone for myself battery life was 82% only lasted 3 hours on a full charge so had to replace at my own cost but the company did pay 50% towards a new battery the phone was bought as excellent condition the screen was flawless but the frame had deep scratches on the screen surrounding the Main camera on the rear off the phone the 2.5mm makes wired noises when trying to focus and sometimes bouncing around on screen all round the phone is in bad condition for the money go somewhere else
"
2624,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
Phone may not have come with it's original box or charger, but I did get an original Apple cable and the charger that came with came with dual USB-A ports, which is even more useful.
"
2625,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
If you have any doubts, kill them immediately. Only thing that was disappointing is that the phone came with the old USB to lightning cable as opposed to the new USB C to lightning cable. But besides that, this thing is an amazing buy for the price
"
2626,B08PCCKHJM,1,"
Very disappointed in the condition of the phone I received! I paid for excellent condition, however that wasn’t what I received!The camera lenses, all 3 lenses were chipped around the edges! The gold casing around the phone was all scratched.I didn’t even turn the phone on, as wasn’t accepting it in the condition I received it.Very disappointing indeed!
"
2627,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
I will never buy a new iPhone again bought the 12pro max renewed it is in as new condition not a single fingerprint never mind a scratch on the phone, battery health at 95% which is as close to perfect as I could expect, and only £650 really it is 5* if you need a phone use this service
"
2628,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
99% battery and not a mark on it and virtually half price! Pained me to have to buy one as I was robbed but really pleased with value for money and will probably never buy new again!
"
2629,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
Was slightly worried about some negative reviews and risks with getting a refurbished iPhone, but it turned out great. Only negatives are the fact it doesn't come in the original box, and the cable is USB-B. The device itself is absolutely spotless, not a single scratch detected after I looked closely for a good 10mn.The battery shows 99% so no complaint here either. Really good experience overall, would definitely recommend.
"
2630,B08PCCKHJM,1,"
Disappointed as it does not come with a basic charger, so what's the point and you cannot check the item as it needs charging, typical, so first impressions are very very poor
"
2631,B08PCCKHJM,4,"
Meet my expectations
"
2632,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
The phone arrived earlier than expected. Except there is couple of minor scratches (hardly visible) on the screen otherwise looks brand new. I’m very happy with my purchase
"
2633,B08PCCKHJM,2,"
Not to the high standard of ‘renewed’ from Amazon that I have been used to in the past.The screen is badly scratched, the bezel edge around the screen is chipped and the ear speaker is not working when making or receiving calls.A far cry from the “This product works and looks like new.” and the “Excellent condition (Refurbished)” write up.
"
2634,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
Great product and looked new.
"
2635,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
The phone is in excellent condition working perfectly no scratches battery is really good
"
2636,B08PCCKHJM,1,"
I am giving it 1 star because it is a really terrible experience for me in my purchase life. I got a not working cable and I requested it again and again but the seller did not solve it. The phone works but it is missing and not functional phone without the original cable. Please do not buy musigmapie on Amazon.
"
2637,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
Neat and clean
"
2638,B08PCCKHJM,1,"
Wasn't  what I expected. Didn't  work.
"
2639,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
Phone arrived 1 day in advance and in perfect condition.No scratches! It works perfectly.
"
2640,B08PCCKHJM,1,"
Well everything other than the screen was as described, apple notified me straight away that the screen/display was FAKE therefore had no choice but to return.
"
2641,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
Excellent quality, fast delivery, thanks
"
2642,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
Brought this phone for my son, he is very happy, perfect condition, and is helping with up cycling, would definitely buy again
"
2643,B08PCCKHJM,1,"
A lot of scratches on board, is not excellent condition.
"
2644,B08PCCKHJM,1,"
I thought buying a refurbished was not only good for recycling/planet but also getting an up to date phone cheaper seeing as most phones have built in obsolescence now.  Unfortunately the phone I received, although in excellent condition, produced exceptional heat during my use, so much so, I turned it off as I was concerned about it exploding and further consideration that it would catch fire during the night etc.  i contacted the company and was asking did I use it while it was being charged, I queried this as with my previous iPhone I used while being charged without problems.  I was happy to have it repaired providing the battery, if that was the problem, or other parts were Apple accredited but was advised that the parts were not Apple but other manufacturers replication which concerned me once more, I then requested a refund.  So I would suggest to anyone, be careful when purchasing a refurbished phone or just buy a cheaper model if your budget restraint is a consideration.
"
2645,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
I was initially concerned about buying a renewed but after receiving it today I could not be happier. Phone is in perfect condition, came with a screen protector already installed. Battery percentage at 92%. Very pleased with the purchase
"
2646,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
I love the mobile. It came with 95% battery without a single scratch. Looks like a brand new one. I really appreciate the customer support. They are very reliable sellers. Close eyes and buy from them.
"
2647,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
A very good purchase.  No issues.The phone appears to be in good condition and works well.Have not activated the face recognition - have given it the benefit of doubt and good score.

2648,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
I’ve bought this iPhone 12 Pro Max on Tuesday, the delivery date should have been between Friday - Monday but I got this the next day.Fast delivery!I’m still testing it but seems good! Exactly like new, battery life is 100%. Face ID seems working!I will update the review for more details!THANK YOU!
"
2649,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
Very happy with phone. Looks brand-new. Battery life fine. Fast delivery.
"
2650,B08PCCKHJM,2,"
The product description which states: ""No signs of cosmetic damage (scratches, dents, etc.) will be visible when the product is held 30 centimeters away"" turned out be a complete lie. The phone came with 2 very noticeable scratches on its screen, which more on its sides. There is also chip damage on its upper corner. These are all viseable from a metre away in a normally lit room, which become very obvious outside and under room lights. The delivery was fast and reliable so can't fault them there.
"
2651,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
Very nice

2661,B08PCCKHJM,1,"
I bought this phone and it stopped working after 2weeks. I returned it and they sent it back to me. The whole process was so frustrating as I was accused of spoiling the phone therefore I have no warranty for it. Please don’t go for this phone.
"
2662,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
Phone came next day, as they promised.Great battery, the camera is wonderful, great price, lovely colour. Came as the description on amazon.

I would have liked to see actual photos of the phone itself because when i got it it had bunch of scufs at the bottom left corner which i would have like to know and the battry health was at 90+ % which is not great

2668,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
Great value for money. Looks brand new. Vomes when it says it dose. Boxed great with all the bits needed.

Battery TERRIBLE! Lasts 5 hours max! Airdrop doesn’t work, voice memo doesn’t work! Seller won’t send a replacement until they have received it back or won’t do a door swap! So have to get another phone before I send it back! It was a birthday present to my self so it’s very disappointing!

I would not advise anyone one to get this product, better to save money and buy a new iphone, or better still, getting one on a contract would sufficeThe device quality is absolutely poor, from the camera quality down to the battery. Quality is not as described by the seller, just deceit. I have requested for a refund and hope I would get back my moneyI have purchased some supposed quality products that turned out defective  however, this is worst, I have never regretted purchasing an item of this nature before..

To begin, the package arrived three days earlier than expected, which was surprising; the phone itself was not in a box upon arrival, which was worrying, although the phone was covered in a thick layer of plastic wrap.  I did see some minor scratches on the screen, but they were not noticeable unless you looked closely.  Otherwise, there was no other damage.  The phone was a bit dirty but was easily cleaned.After using the phone for about a month, I realized this was an excellent upgrade.  Yes, it was expensive, although I moved up from an iPhone 8, so the pros outweighed the cons.  What are the cons?  The maximum hold on the battery is 91%, not fantastic, but it is way better than my iPhone 8; it outlives that phone by a mile.  It is a heavier phone, and I wasn't expecting the weight of it.  I can hold it with one hand and still type with the holding hand, although the weight on my pinky as I hold it up does hurt after a while.  The price was quite a bit for a refurbished phone, in my opinion, but as an upgrade, the phone is impressive.For Pros, this phone has a different layout; it took me a mere week to get over the fact there is no button; remember, I upgraded from an iPhone 8, where the button still exists.  Honestly, I prefer face recognition; it is just way more easier to do anything, rather than failing the touch ID over and over.  Again as the battery was also a con, it is also a pro; it lasts way longer than my iPhone 8 ever did.  Something I shouldn't have to go over, but the camera is divine; it is so surreal to me.  I love it.  As for calling people and so on, everyone can hear me very clearly, and I hear them better.  Lastly, the speakers are excellent; I feel like it is surround sound almost, compared to my iPhone 8, this iPhone 12 Pro Max is just outstanding.Overall, this was a wonderful upgrade, although it did have some cons as not everything is perfect.

Relieved when my phone arrived in a really lovely environmentally friendly box. No damage or scratches to be seen on the phone at all, looks brand new, battery life 90%. Was ready to be set up with about 10% charge. Came with a plug and charging cable. As you can see on the photo it can be registered for a one year warranty. Bought through UR, delivered by Royal Mail 48hrs after ordering. Will defos come back to them in a few years to upgrade once more. Highly recommend.
"
2701,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
The product was delivered on time and in great condition. After thinking about whether I should get a 12 pro max or 13, I'm glad I got this. I'm still getting use to the very big screen but it's also another reason I like the phone—definitely, value for money.Just a slight thing tho, the packaging could have been better as it came in a cardboard box with very little protection.

This is my first time of buying a renewed iPhone from Amazon. The product is in excellent condition with a battery level of 85%. The phone is very clean with no mark at all. It is working perfectly well. It is a good way to save money on a latest phone.The price is very competitive and delivery was super fast. Excellent customer service from Amazon as usual.I strongly recommend renewed phones, there is no much difference with brand new and you will save a lot of money.The guarantee is One year as well, and mine came with Apple care till 12 November 2022.

Cannot fault this phone! I was slightly sceptical to buy a refurbished phone but I did not need to worry, Mazuma (provider might be different for others) really pulled through! Perfect condition and 100% battery health, it was already charged so I could use it straight away. Definitely worth getting a more reasonably priced iPhone 12 Pro Max than the iPhone Pro Max 13, which only has a couple more features that I wouldn't even care about. Thanks again Mazuma!

"
2717,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
It’s a very good and just the right size too. The only problem is that the battery health being a bit low at 91% but that not a big deal to me as it still lasts me the entire day without charging it.
"
2718,B08PCCKHJM,4,"
Great phone so far, always wary with refurb but with Amazon 1 year hopefully cross fingers will be ok, advert states a plug included they seem to disagree, wrong lead sent but am using my original lead, definitely worth upgrade from XR to 12 Pro Max. Disappointed with 82% battery others state they had 95% at least may have to replace battery sooner than I thought
"
2719,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
Great deal, my wife had one and this was for my daughter and she simply loves it
"
2720,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
The phone works perfectly well. It is exactly what was described in the advert. Battery life 87%. I have no reason to complain.

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 £740 is a big old chunk of cash to spend when some of the reviews showed trashed phones and talked of difficult returns. I had decided to buy a new iPhone at £1000 instead because of the bad reviews but there was a 2 month wait and I’m inpatient so rolled the dice. As you can see in the video of me opening the package the 12 ProMax I got was pristine, battery health was 99% and I’m delighted, it comes well packaged in a box similar to the Apple design with a generic lightning charger and sim pin. I think it would be useful if the condition of the actual phone you’ll get was somewhere in the description rather than generic text, I know three conditions are described in one of the pictures but I could not find these referenced in the description.
"
2722,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
I was slightly worried after ordering this product as I’ve started to read through the reviews of convincing lack of quality from this company but nothing could be further from the truth.I have ordered the refurbished phone (close to new), I have done every check on the phone that I possibly could and I’ve concluded that the product I received was worth every penny. If you’re the type to care about the smallest scuff on your phone then please just buy a brand new phone. My screen has a couple scratches but it was not noticeable unless you look through a microcope. They have not cut any corners, full OLED screen, camera is crisp, touch screen has no faults.The only negative that alot of people seem to share is the battery percentage but that’s a loss I can take for the price. Anyways worry not, you’re safe with this purchase. :)Edit: wow, didn't expect that many people to find this review helpful. glad i could help.

2723,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
Fabulous phone This phone is perfect for me, does everything I need, much larger so I can see things much more clearly fast action. I couldn’t be happier.
"
2724,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
The phone's physical condition is good, with no scratches; it looks like a brand-new iPhone.  I liked the phone's colour (pacific blue), and the battery health was around 88% when it arrived. The camera is working fine. After using it for more than a month now, I am satisfied with my purchase. Worth investing. No screen freeze or other issues.
"
2725,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
Pleased with the purchase no signs of use perhaps could have included the removal tool
"
2726,B08PCCKHJM,4,"
Really good quality, no scratches or scuffs at all. The only problem is the battery health. It’s not too bad but 86% isn’t the best considering it’s £700. Except for that it’s great!
"

Ordered this 12 pro max excellent condition (256gb)I was nervous buying second hand but Extremely satisfied with the purchase:Physical condition:1. Excellent body and screen condition2. No marks on body or edges3. There is a tiny dot on the screen visible at very specific angle while trying hard. So I wouldn’t be bothered a lotPerformance;1. I have used the phone for over 2 weeks now and have had no issues at all2. Battery % when received was 87% which is advertised and acceptable

2728,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
First time buying a renewed phone but my iPhone X was so painful to use + Face ID didn’t work and front camera didn’t work from where I smashed the screen, it was like that for 2 years and I had finally had enough, looked around for a while, compared specs of 12, 13, 14 pro max, not much in it compared with the price scaling, looked on back market and almost ordered from there, checked trust pilot and there were a lot of bad reviews, checked on here, found this, ordered it, it came, barely a thing wrong with it, the tiniest mark on the screen which I can’t even see with a screen protector on, cameras work perfectly, Face ID works perfectly, battery life is impeccable, this was such a good deal and I feel so lucky to have come across it, it sounds dumb but it feels so good to have a newer faster phone like I don’t know, it just feels great, I love it, will definitely be doing this again in years time or however long I can make this phone last for! 😁 100% recommend!

La confezione è spartanissima, il prodotto è  giunto in buone condizioni,  ed anche se la scocca i gusci ed il vetro sono perfetti, la batterie era all85% anche se comprato  come “perfette condizioni” inavvertitamente ci è caduta un po di acqua sopra e per 15 minuti anche se spento e perfettamente asciugato alla riaccensione l'alto parlante ed il microfono gracchiavano.Quindi in ansia per lIP 68 che credo non vi sia.

Il telefono è perfetto. Le condizioni erano pari al nuovo e così infatti è risultato. Sembra quasi che nessuno l’abbia mai utilizzato. Nessun graffio e nessuna ammaccatura. Se si vuole acquistare un ricondizionato è bene stare attenti al grado riguardanti le condizioni. Avendo acquistato diversi ricondizionati non mi sono trovata mai male nel scegliere quelli in condizioni eccellenti o pari al nuovo. Unica piccola pecca può essere la batteria che si presenta all’89%. Ma avendo già avuto una batteria simile posso dire che non crea nessun tipo di problema.Oltre al telefono nella scatola era presente il cavetto con il caricatore originali e con la pellicola di imballaggio della Apple. Quindi mai usati.Mi sento di consigliare vivamente questo venditore.
"
2737,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
Sono rimasto veramente sorpreso. Il telefono è arrivato con 1 giorno di anticipo. Display come nuovo, nemmeno un micro graffio. Parte posteriore del telefono come nuova. L'unica pecca è il bordo con 6 micro ammaccature, ma anche con una cover trasparente non si vedono. Stato della batteria al 96%. Il telefono funziona perfettamente. Rapporto qualità prezzo super bilanciato. 5 stelle meritatissime!
"
2738,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
Edit: acquistato in grafite per mio marito, arrivato iPhone altrettanto perfetto al mio, con batteria altrettanto al 91%. Immacolato letteralmente pari al nuovo👏🏼Per ora - non sapessi di averlo pagato quel che ho pagato e non ci fosse la batteria al 91% (su tel di due anni), penserei che si tratti di un iPhone nuovo di pacco😱Esteticamente immacolato. Non un segno graffio o ombra👍🏼Al momento, perfettamente funzionante👍🏼Vedremo nel tempo…ma a prescindere vado tranquilla grazie alla garanzia Amazon Renewed che consente reso e rimborso per un anno intero 🙏🏼 grazie Amazon e grazie al venditore che me lo ha spedito con velocità da teletrasporto - quando in teoria arrivava 10gg dopo. Eccezionale.

O único ponto negativo é que a bateria veio a 88%, não muito longe valor mínimo recomendado pela apple, por isso a classificação amazon de ""como novo"" quanto a mim não é a mais adequada. Esteticamente veio muito bom.

2743,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
Esperienza al di sopra delle aspettative. Il prodotto è arrivato in due giorni lavorativi, molto meglio del previsto, in un imballo corretto. L’iphone ha la batteria al 100%, il fondo sostituito con parte originale Apple e non presenta nessun segno o graffio visibile. Praticamente un prodotto nuovo.

Es el tercer móvil que compro de Amazon, y el único que me llega con buena salud de batería . A la tercera va la vencida !!! . La verdad es que estoy encantada con el, es precioso, me vino con un par de rasguñitos pequeños en el lateral, pero nada que una funda no tape, la salud de la batería me llego con un 97%. Un chollo. Estoy contentísima. Lo que pasa es que puedes tener la suerte de que te llegue con un 80% de salud(como mi anterior iPhone XS Max) o con un 97% de salud(como este mismo)Pero a mi me parece genial económicamente esta opción de poder comprar reacondicionados. Solo que como dije antes, puede salirte bien, o no. En caso de no salirte bien la batería, devuelves y pruebas otro.

2748,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
avendo letto altre recensioni di resi per danneggiamento allo schermo o al corpo del telefono ero titubante, ma il telefono è arrivato con un giorno di anticipo ed era perfetto.zero segni o graffi, come da immagini allegate.nella scatola trovate anche il caricatore, il cavo usb c/lightning e la graffetta a spillo per estrarre/inserire la sim (che erano un po’ buttati lì a caso, ma per un ricondizionato non originale non mi formalizzerei).consiglio l’acquisto, anche perché garantito dal reso Amazon per un anno (motivo principale che mi ha spinto all’acquisto nonostante i dubbi di cui sopra).UPDATE: a distanza di un paio di giorni mi sono resa conto che la batteria si scaricava in modo strano, e andando a cercare tra le impostazioni ho visto che il suo stato di salute era di una carica massima dell'87%. ho fatto il reso e sto attendendo il rimborso
"

"
2751,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
Venia con una de las cámaras un poco rallada(que no influye para nada). La única pega que le podría poner es que me vino con un 82% de salud de batería, pero igualmente aguanta un día entero sin problemas ni fallos, al precio que lo he comprado es normal que tenga algún detallito. Una batería nueva tampoco vale mucho, llevo un mes de uso y va perfecto y tiene garantía.

Je ne prends d'habitude pas le temps d'écrire un commentaire mais je ferai une exception cette fois ci. Quelle bonne surprise. Comme beaucoup je me méfiais d'une mauvaise surprise en faisant le choix du reconditionné et bien je ne me suis trompé. J'ai acheté auprès de ce vendeur un iPhone 12 Pro Max en excellent etat et le moins que l'on puisse dire c'est que la promesse est tenue. Etat impeccable, aucune rayure, livraison en avance. Et en prime une batterie à 94% de sa pleine capacité. Je suis ravi de mon achat.

Il telefono è stato consegnato in condizioni eccellenti. Non presenta un minimo graffio, batteria completamente funzionante e il telefono svolge tutte le sue funzioni ed operazioni in tranquillità. Per essere un prodotto ricondizionato è davvero ottimo. In genere sono sempre stato scettico dei prodotti ricondizionati, ma questo acquisto mi ha lasciato davvero sorpreso.

Le téléphone est intact, au défaut sur l'écran, l'arrière est nickel juste une minuscule égratignures au niveau d'une touche sur le côté mais faut vraiment regarder pour le voir et batterie à 97% . Franchement nous on on est super content, je vous recommande ce vendeur. Après ça fait seulement 3 jrs qu'on la donc j'espère qu'il n'y aura pas de soucis à la longue. Je sais pas si il y a une garantie sur l'article.

Il dispositivo è arrivato in condizioni estetiche perfette (si nota che è stata sostituita la parte posteriore) nessun graffio o segno di usura. Batteria al 94% (ben oltre le aspettative). Ho avuto un piccolo problema con lo speaker superiore risolto con un po’ di pulizia. Per ogni dubbio o informazione il venditore ha risposto sempre in maniera tempestiva.

Déjà, je l’ai reçu en 48h, en main propre. C’est excellent.Le téléphone est bien emballé. Avec des accessoires non officiels mais de bonne qualitée.Le téléphone présente des traces de doigts sur la vitre, après nettoyage, la dalle est parfaite et sans rayure ni micro imperfections, les objectifs on eut besoin d’un nettoyage, car sale. Pas rayer. L’arrière est parfait.Le téléphone présente également des impacts, plusieurs. Le cadre en aluminium est également rayé et présente des imperfections visuelles autour des boutons.La batterie à une capacité de 87%, ce qui est correct.Je suis relativement satisfaite de mon achat, j’espère juste la durée dans le temps de mon produit.

Prodotto consegnato con carica batterie sbagliato infatti non è il 20 watt e non ha il cavetto appropriato poi in considerazione che ho acquistato un rigenerato in condizioni eccellenti non avrebbe dovuto riportare il vetro graffiato in ben tre punti. Come rigenerato è da considerare in buone condizioni ma non eccellenti. Batteria con resa all’83 per cento.

Lieferung heute erhalten. Laut Beschreibung sollte es sich um ein generalüberholtes IPhone 12 Pro Max handeln, welches aussieht wie neu.Auf dem Display waren keine Macken, dafür umso mehr am Rahmen.An alle Ecken und Kanten befinden sich Kratzer und Riefen.Aber dann sowas als „Wie neu“ zu deklarieren ist eine Frechheit bei fast 800€. Karton war auch nicht original.Kabel und Ladegerät lagen separat in der Kiste. Billigste Ware (no Name)Akku Zustand bei 80% d.h. Fast 2 Jahre gebraucht.
"
2813,B08PCCKHJM,5,"
The store I got my phone from is called Flip4shop. I’m very happy with the purchase. The condition was listed as “acceptable” There are some scratches on the screen at a few locations, and some scratches at the lightning port, but I really don’t care. My old phone was way more scratched up than this. Just slap on a glass screen protector and a case and it’s good as new. The battery lifespan is at 98%. What’s important to me are that no glass is cracked and a good battery. I’d hazard a guess this was a display model at a phone shop and have been played around by customers. For the price it was very value for money and I would not hesitate to buy my next phone here with them again.

J’étais un peu septique à l’idée de prendre un téléphone reconditionné. Et franchement je suis agréablement surprise !! iPhone 12 Pro Max acheté en « excellent état » en effet comme neuf !! 0 micro rayures !! Vraiment en parfait parfait état. Petit bémol 92% de batterie mais bon à ce prix je suis satisfaite pour le moment . Téléphone acheté hier à 13h30 reçu le lendemain à la même heure !! Quelle rapidité !!

Pensavo che un ricondizionato avesse la batteria al 100%. Questo articolo Iphone 12 pro max ha invece una batteria già usata, per la precisione ha l'86% di capacità (allego foto). Dopo 2 giorni ho notato anche alcuni puntini bianchi, simili a piccole ammaccature sulla parte laterale  (superficiali) dell'Iphone che erano stati oscurati sicuramente con qualche pennarello, e dopo qualche ora di uso tornati alla luce.Ne usufruisco qualche altro giorno e capisco se chiedere il reso.

Ho acquistato un iPhone 12 pro Max in condizioni eccellenti quindi al prezzo più alto. È arrivato in tempi brevi ma appena aperto il pacco mi ritrovo un telefono che non è in condizioni eccellenti come da descrizione poiché il bordo esterno e il bordino delle fotocamere erano graffiati e e con delle ammaccature. Non ero interessata a vederlo accesso, è stato sufficiente vederlo esternamente. Ho preparato il pacco per il reso che è già stato effettuato. Adesso aspetto il rimborso.

Il telefono è arrivato in super anticipo e in condizioni perfette: è praticamente nuovo e perfettamente funzionante.L’unica pecca, se vogliamo chiamarla così, è lo stato batteria all’88%, sceso all’86% dopo due aggiornamenti di sistema.Ora come ora non costituisce un gran problema perché il telefono mi dura un giorno e mezzo con utilizzo intenso, ma avrei avvertito. Soprattutto perché lo stato è “come nuovo”.

Le téléphone soit disant reconditionné en excellent état s’est arrêté de fonctionner en moins d une journée après la livraison. Je ne peux même plus le rallumer ou le charger. Je dois donc le restituer . C’est la dernière fois que j’achète du reconditionné. Le service d’assistance de Amazon a été nul. Ils m’ont conseillé de contacter Apple pour qu’il le rallume !!! Apple ne prendra jamais en charge un phone reconditionné qui ne vient pas de chez eux mais d’un vendeur Amazon. N’importe quoi…J’ai du en acheter un neuf en urgence pour travailler  . Bref du temps perdu

Il prodotto dicono che sia revisionato, speriamo sia così, perchè hanno dimenticato di pulirlo, infatti sono dovuto ricorrere al centro apple perchè si sentiva piano hanno dovuto pulire la parte audio adesso si sente bene, ma ho dovuto spendere altri 15 euro.Deluso

2836,B08PCCKHJM,2,"
Il prodotto si presenta apparentemente in buono stato, con un paio di  graffii sul display non evidentissimi, la batteria 86% e qui mi aspettavo un tantino in più avendo acquistato un prodotto con condizione eccellenti. La sorpresa è stata l’auricolare, che si sente davvero poco. Reso indispensabile!

Vraiment la livraison reste à désirer certe c’est vendu sans boîte je suis dàccord mais mettre le téléphone juste en dessous d’un petit carton… et la batterie ouais c’est marche minimum 85% de l’état mais enfin je part du principe que le téléphone coûte comme meme 900€ le minimum serrai d’avoir une meilleure état des batterie

Il prodotto è perfetto, sia nelle condizioni che per l’imballaggio. Mi sarebbe piaciuto che avesse scritto il deterioramento in percentuale della batteria. Avevo un’iphone 11 che ho preso a giugno 2020 e l’ho venduto con 93% di batteria, questo l’ho preso apparentemente intatto ma che alla fine aveva il 90%. Si lo so, sono piccoli dettagli, forse anche superflui, ma io da venditore, lo avrei scritto.

Produkt kam zeitnah an und war ohne Polsterung in einer Kiste verpackt. I Phone Karton war offen und das Handy in eine Plastiktüte gewickelt.Eine Polsterung im Paket wäre schön gewesen. So wäre nichts hin und her gescheppert. Artikel war wie beschrieben und in Ordnung.

Envoi rapide et fiable. iPhone en excellent état. Le téléphone cependant ne charge pas. Le vendeur a expédié un autre chargeur. Celui charge mieux, c'est un fait, par contre l'iPhone ne garde pas la charge. Il s'éteint brusquement et très difficile à se rallumer. Il a été réinitialisé : même soucis. Que faire ? Merci.

Arrivato anche prima del previsto, ero contentissimo della cosa. I problemi sono cominciati da quando l'ho attivato. In poche parole fintantochè non aggiornavo il sistema operativo staccava ed attacava la rete a suo piacimento, passando da nessun servizio a 4G piena in un secondo: questo problema causava una chiusura delle chiamate vocali dopo una media di 15-17 secondi.Eseguo l'aggiornamento del sistema e la rete cellulare praticamente morta e sepolta su nessun servizio. Avvio le pratiche per il reso ma ancora non ho ricevuto risposta dal venditore. Sono andato in un centro apple e mi hanno detto che nonostante il telefono sia internamente che esternamente sia privo di problematiche non si riescono a spiegare il perchè di questo problema.Spero di non dover ricorrere per vie legali dato che il cellulare l'ho acquistato con finanziamento.

Am a regular apple user and this phone is great. I don’t think you need the latest model.  The facial recognition makes it quicker to open. Camera good quality too.

Overall a very good phone, and serves its purpose- finally replaced my old iPhone 7.  It needs a bit of getting used to slid to the next screen.Saved £££ during Prime Day.  Items arrived opened box and without a manual- but received an extra discount.  Very pleased with the extra saving!
"
2983,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
I had one of these a while ago but it was the first that Apple brought out. When I got a new Apple I passed it onto the wife and she thought it was great, years pass and the phone packs up ( the battery) so I bought her the iPhone 12 upgraded version it’s taken a while to get her bearings on it but she getting there!
"
2984,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
As expected
"
2985,B08L5RD3KR,4,"
So the phone works amazing had it for a good few months now and has done me wonders but the only problem is the battery seems to not last as long as it should do I don’t know if it got damaged on the way or that’s me just having to much of expectations but other than that I would recommend having this phone

My last iPhone was the 1st Gen iPhone SE in 2016, it was great however it had a small 32GB storage, I got rid of it because I kept running out of space and iCloud drive wasn't great at the time, hence I got the 256GB capacity iPhone 12Been on Android for 5 years and it's been a welcome return back to iPhone, the phone is smooth, animations are immediate, FaceID has never let me down, with Apple's 20W charger, the charge time is pretty good too. iPhone 12 has wireless charging which makes it perfect to charge conveniently in the car.Battery life is okay, nothing to write home about, I'm a power user and I can get 6 hours of screen on time day to day, and very rarely have I killed it in one day.Design wise, if you loved the iPhone 4, you'll love this, it's an extension of that design idea, not slippery to hold like previous iPhones, this is Apple at it's best when it comes to industrial design.Highly recommend the iPhone 12, I think it's the pick of the bunch since the Pro models have the same A14 processor and unless you really want LiDAR and the extra macro camera, I think this is the pick of the bunch.

Ordered to replace my iPhone 11. Phone has a great camera, facial recognition, easy to use, clear screen quality etc… but the battery does not last long at all. I feel I am constantly having to charge it up where I could have the same usage with my iPhone 11 and the battery would last all day.

A real bargain from Amazon warehouse. Came in pristine condition 100% battery and 9 months of Apple care still on the phone.Happy customer and would definitely look at finding the same deal again in the future
"
2995,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
This was a replacement for my ageing iPhone 7plus and it was worth the wait. I got this before the iPhone 13 was release at a very good price, its screen, battery life and speed are all excellent and with the longevity of the apple devices and the support for several years of updates I had no hesitation to buy another over the android devices that have very poor support for anything more than one year. I have been delighted with the ease of migrating data from one phone to the next which used wireless pairing and seamless migration of everything from my old phone to the new one. The camera is also excellent and its a nice device to hold too. Shame I have to put it in a case for work due to the hostile environments I work in. Otherwise I would recommend this to those looking for an upgrade from an older device at a more affordable price
"
2996,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Had to send my XR back bad connection problems but usual excellent customer service from Amazon so decided to upgrade to a 12 not a lot of cosmetic difference between them nothing seem to change much on the working aspect of the phones keep giving fancy write ups re the camera but sadly a picture is a picture to me I don’t see the difference between any photos never really grasp the extortionate prices for I phones one is much like the other if you compare them on apples compare I phones there is very little difference in the phone apart from the price legalised extortion by apple really had all different models of iPhones since their conception only had trouble with the XR but the warranty covered that so see how this one goes
"
2997,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
The only thing I was pleasantly surprised about after a few days usage is the battery life, which I expected to be worse after reading other reviews. I'm coming from an iPhone 7 Plus that I used for 4 years, so I was expecting to notice the upgrade. I easily manage to get 30-40% charge at the end of the day with normal use (about 1h in voice calls, 15 minutes videocall, occasional YouTube videos, texting and 3-4 pictures throughout the day).I'm not using the camera for pictures and videos much, as I prefer using my Fujifilm mirrorless for photography.I love the blue color, but I am biased as it is my favorite. I was tempted by the black one, which I believe is going to be the most picked one. Face ID works like a charm. It's unfortunate we are in a pandemic and wear masks when shopping, so Face ID won't work for contactless payments. It does quickly switch to passcode though, so you can avoid removing your face covering, as you are not supposed to. I have tried recommended methods to make it work with a face covering, but it did not work for me.
"
2998,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
The iPhone 12 is a brilliant phone. I originally had an iPhone 8 and upgraded to the 12. The camera is brilliant - the pictures come out so crisp and look amazing. I like the more rounder edges of this iPhone as well. I got the iPhone 12 in blue and it looks so great, the picture of it doesn’t do it justice! The only downside of this is that due to the price I’d have hoped to have got headphones and I thankfully already had a mains plug but if someone else was buying an apple product for the first time then you will need to buy one or you aren’t able to charge your phone. The size is of this phone is great too, I’m so glad I didn’t go for the bigger size because this can fit into your pocket perfectly. I love that this has face recognition (what did I do before this?!) it’s so much easier to use now even though with having to use masks all the time right now it isn’t difficult for that but worth it if you aren’t needing to use Apple Pay!
"
2999,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
I purchased the iPhone 12 to replace my iPhone SE on which the battery was failing and needed recharging more than once a day. As soon as I received the new phone (the day after I ordered it, excellent service) I transferred the contents to the new phone without having to get assistance, so other than being a bit bigger it is as easy to use as the last phone. The keyboard is bigger so easier for me to type. Face recognition, the first time I have used it is brilliant but I fear I may forget my passwords as it is easier to use. All in all it is a great phone I haven’t used the camera yet, but I’m pretty sure it will be better than my old phone. Now charging once every two days, for now. I can only say that I love iPhones and think they are worth the extra money.👍

The last time I bought a new iPhone was in 2011, since then I’ve always bought 2nd hand because of the cost, but this time Amazon let me get the phone on monthly payments.I went for the iPhone 12 256GB and WOW, I was impressed the 1st night I had it. I’m a photo taker and this phone just amazes me with the quality of the camera alone. All the photos were taken at night with NO flash and they look amazing.Siri listens for the 1st time ever!It’s soooooo loud compared to my old 7s Plus, it’s almost like I have a soundbar in my pocket!I love the colour, I went for the Green one, well it is different!It’s seriously fast too, once I ordered a 5G sim from my provider that is!I have zero complaints about the phone, worth the money as I know it will last!

3003,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Expensive for what it is, but then all the newest phones are.It is a nice phone though and I feel if you’ve had multiple iphones in the past, you know what it’s all about. It’ll take some adjusting to without having a home button at the bottom and a few additional button combinations and swipe patterns to get used.The camera’s are a noticeable improvement, and I do like the face id to unlock - and when I’m wearing a face mask it will still unlock if it detects I’m wearing my apple watch so it knows it’s me.The bigger screen is nice and I’m hoping the battery lasts longer with it being bigger but I have to say I do like having a phone you can operate with 1 hand and this does require 2 to reach all extremities of the screen.

I like it. No problem with it just like it’s says in description. Brand new. No damages. Working perfectly.
"
3005,B08L5RD3KR,4,"
It's fairly responsive in touch and speed with opening appsThe camera doesn't feel that much improved but it's still very goodI'd say the best thing about the phone is the better CPU allow smooth operation and of course a better battery lifeI've given 4 stars due to the fact that Apple take the  liberty of removing earphones, chargers or adapters. I sincerely hope other companies don't follow suit.It's crazy enough paying almost 1k for phones nowadays and to receive nothing else additional feels like robbery

I bought this iPhone two days ago and it arrived today. I confess I was so afraid of being robbed on the way from UK to Dublin. Well, thank Gosh it didn't happen. I got it, recharged, put my acc on it, all my apps, SIM card and everything is absolutely fantastic. I don't think I need to write about the performance of the phone (because it's awesome) but I am sure to recommend if you are looking for a phone here in Amazon, check the sellers and the reviews and pray :DThank you

Phone arrived on time, the currier arrived to the door and we both was scared on the trade of parcel for password and at the end we made safe; nothing wrong with the currier, the shipping was excellent. I turned on the phone and the system started with aggressive configurations and queries for phone identifier, I text a software engineer in the group to restore IMEI and component serial, technically the amazon control team was using a foreign country identification for myself name, and I am attending the reset to first start of the phone to obtain primary original IOS addons and amazon shopping reference in UK.

This is definitely my favourite iphone I have had so far, the design is great and feels really nice to hold and feels really smooth to use with its fast speeds, the camera takes really nice clear pictures and the video quality is great, also the sound from the speakers is great and loud which is good when watching videos and listing to music on, the screen size is also perfect for me as not to big and not to small, nice to watch YouTube and other videos on and also good for gaming as games also run nice and smooth. This is the perfect mobile phone for me as does everything i want and just the right size. Highly recommend this iphone as very happy with it.

Apple rarely disappoint because they follow a formula that works. If you have used iPhone in the last 5 years. You come to expect what iPhone’s are capable with. This iPhone was purchased as an upgrade from an iPhone 8 Plus for my mum and it is an healthy upgrade. If you have an 11 or XR maybe wait till 14 because by that point their should be a noticeable upgrade.

We always save up and purchase our phones out right and then get a monthly sim only deal as you save a fortune over a 2/3 year contract. This iPhone isn’t all bells and whistles - not a huge difference from our previous iPhone 7 Plus - however the camera is significantly better and the battery life lasts a whole day without charging and the face recognition is quick and easy - even wearing glasses or a mask! . Having said that, I probably don’t use all the features on it - so may be missing out on some major upgrades - but for my needs it’s perfect.We are an Apple family and love them and if that’s the case, would recommend this phone.
"
3018,B08L5RD3KR,4,"
Very good Smartphone - like ever - but one important thing is missing: FingerPrint reader. Nowadays where we are constantly using masks, just face recognition is not enough. It should have kept the fingerprint reader - in the same way I have in my old iPhone 8.I have a Xiaomi that costs 30% - and IT contains both, face and fingerprint options. This is a very expensive product, should bring everything - including the charger... come on!

Used Android phones for years, pretty much every pixel phone, and quite a few samsungs, thought it was time to try an iphone.Love it, nice design, quality, great camera and battery life.Everything about it feels premium.
"
3020,B08L5RD3KR,3,"
Pros:It gives premium feel and rich experience, which is obvious.Camera is really good which iPhone is known for.Cons:Sometime it hangs all of a sudden. The app icons doesn't work at all. And I must restart the phone to make it work again. It may be one device issue but it shouldn't be even for one device given the price.While talking on WhatsApp call, my voice won't go through if the other person is talking.
"
3021,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Switching from Android to an iPhone for the 1st time was an adjustment but the phone is really easy to use, camera is great, battery life very good.All in all very pleased with the iphone 12
"
3022,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
I bought this as an upgrade from iPhone 8. Love the face recognition , easy to set up from my old phone.Camera is better. And bigger screen.
"
3023,B08L5RD3KR,4,"
I moved to iphone from samsung just for camera quality. however if you are looking for best pictures, u still need to go for pro or even pro max. Before buying, i watched quite alot of youtube videos which compare the cameras and donot really find a big difference. In real life, when you put both iphone 12 and pro cameras together, it makes a difference in my personal view. Especially when it is dark, or complete opposite too bright ! So if you are buying mainly for camera and paying this money, just try yo go for pro if you can, if not, it is a great phone, great battery life, super fast... best iphone generation...
"
3024,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Came in perfect conditions. No complaints
"
3025,B08L5RD3KR,4,"
My previous phone was an iPhone X and in its case the C fitted in most of my pockets the IPhone 12 is just a little bigger and once in the wallet it does not fit in most of my pockets
"
3026,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Absolute disappointment. Never had so many issues with network connection on any devices I owned. Week mobile  reception, Wi-Fi is the worst won't connect or stay connected. Total garbage. Will sell it and never look on iphone again. Even Friking Poco F3 does better job for less than half price.
"
3027,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
I am very satisfied with this phone. For my needs it’s absolutely fine: wonderful pictures, battery life is good, easy to use!
"
3028,B08L5RD3KR,4,"
My old iPhone 7 broke. Bought this iPhone 12 to replace it. The colour blue is okay as expected. The bigger screen is what i wanted. Other functions are all similar to my iPhone 7, so i had no problem using it. It takes better pictures, comfortable to hold, battery life is okay so far as i turned icloud back-up off so the battery life lasts longer. I am quite happy with it.
"
3029,B08L5RD3KR,4,"
This is a replacement for my iPhone 5, which tho working fine, could no longer download apps! 🤬. Love the phone & colour & all its additions. Size is great as my eyes are not. Only downside is the keys are a bit too small & I keep hitting wrong ones.
"
3030,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Would take a photo but can’t because I’m using the phone because it’s so good! It’s apple so you should expect it to be good. Came well packed and I damaged. Came on the day it said and was perfect.
"
3031,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
It’s Apple and it’s an iPhone and as expected it’s exactly what I wanted. Face recognition is a massive improvement on using a finger.
"
3032,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
I’ve been needing to get a new phone for months and originally I was going to get an iPhone 11 but after the 11 being out of stock EVERYWHERE, I decided to buy the 12 since Amazon offered a pay-monthly scheme for it. The payments are £145.80 spread over 5 months which is really good and overall works out cheaper for me.The colour is gorgeous, the camera is excellent and overall it’s a very good phone. Really pleased :)
"
3033,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Great phone, not a fan of the lack of a headphone port
"
3034,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
My iPhone 7 was no longer keeping up so I took the plunge for a new phone. The technology is mind boggling and the device is beautiful.  Facial recognition works even in the dark making this phone even more user friendly and convenient.
"
3035,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Great phone, good price.
"
3036,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Can’t go wrong
"
3037,B08L5RD3KR,4,"
Great phone, a lot of money but they usually last long. The finishing on the back (shiny on the standard 12) is a bit annoying as it gets full of fingertips, the lack of headphones and charging brick is a joke for the money you spend.The building quality is amazing, the software is brilliant and the transition from another iPhone is amazing.
"
3038,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
I bought this for my son and I don't know the first thing about technology but I know that he wanted a iPhone so I read the reviews and decided to buy it for him off Amazon, I checked around to make sure I was paying the right price and I do trust Amazon so my thinking was if it's not what he wants I can return it and get a full refund. He loves it and says it's much better than the phone he had which isn't a iPhone but a good one nethertheless. He went for a walk and sent me the above picture on his new iphone it was getting dark and the quality is exceptional compared to his old phone. He said it's brilliant and would highly recommend it.
"
3039,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Just bought this iPhone 12 in purple beautiful phone really great price on Amazon thank you! Very easy to set up and install from your old iPhone there is definitely a difference between the iPhone 11 and this iPhone 12 well worth buying this is  my favourite iPhone and I’ve  ever owned and I’ve had iPhones  since iPhone 4 very good experience buying from Amazon as i was able to pay monthly interest free instead of outright like I’ve done previously with apple just noticed it’s 20 % off today so even more reason to buy this stunning iPhone  from apple via Amazon as far cheaper than apple store
"
3040,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Great phone and easy to use.
"
3041,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Really nice phone to be honest. Always been an android user. Slowly been moving over to apple devices elsewhere and decided for this upgrade to switch. The eco system is fantastic and the iPhone 12 just completes it. The battery life is phenomenal, I’m not glued to my phone so obviously your mileage will vary. But it always last the day and will charge to 80% to preserve the life of the battery. As I don’t require a full charge each day. Really snappy and hasn’t let me down once yet on the 3 months I’ve had it.
"
3042,B08L5RD3KR,3,"
All my Busines and family activity.I should not  have bought it. Facial recognition good. Battery life awful. Should gone for iPhone 13.
"
3043,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
I changed from an 11 Pro Max to the 12 because I like to keep up to date, even though to be honest it doesn't feel any faster because it shares the same gig mem. But I was a little tired of the weight and size of the 11 Pro Max and enjoy the smaller form factor of the 12. Though I must say I didn't see the phone in person (in an Apple store) before I purchased online, and I wouldn't call it red, more like a dark salmon in colour. If I had seen it in person first, I would have gone for another colour. But then again, after the case is on, all I see is the camera cut out.
"
3044,B08L5RD3KR,3,"
I’ve had an iPhone 6s for some years and decided to upgrade to an iPhone 12. I thought I’d notice a difference but apart from having lots of storage I’m disappointed with my new phone, nothing seems any different with it, for example battery life is still poor, downloading speed still quite slow etc, not sure it was worth the money
"
3045,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
I decided to buy a new phone as opposed to a secondhand phone, although it’s very expensive it’s what I have been using for years! Still working out how everything works!
"
3046,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
This iPhone 12 have been amazing the battery life would last even the whole day I love it only thing I dislike is that we weren’t given a proper charger
"
3047,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
iPhone 12, is a phone worth purchasing. I found it abit challenging at first not being able to find my way around the interface, however, now I have adjusted, thumbs up.Face recognition is new to me and I now find it very useful when not wearing a mask 😂. Battery life is excellent.I also like the feature were I can set it on 4G/5G.
"
3048,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
The iPhone 12 is superb it is the perfect middle of the road phone. Its updated to latest specs and software does what ever is needed.Its an excellent phone its screen is the perfect size, especially now that I just upgraded from iPhone 7. so its a world of a difference. the only issues are the price it is overpriced and the faceID which I feel is a step down from the more secure touchID and too much of a gimmick.The battery is outstanding it literally lasts all day - 2 days without recharge especially if you’re a light user!A superb all around phone.
"
3049,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
The phone is as expected.However just pray you don’t have any issues.I had issues and Amazon and Amazon’s customer service is simply shocking.You pay over £800 for a phone and have a problem within 24 hours, I expect a replacing phone not a repair!!I ended up going to the apple store in birmingham who sorted the phone.I’ll never buy an item like this from Amazon again
"
3050,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
I have been an android user since I switched from my iPhone 4 back in 2011. This design really takes me back and I’ve got to admit Apple have done a superb job here.I’ve recently used the pixel 2xl and the pixel 3a and considering google have done a really good job with their own stripped back software, for me it’s nowhere near to Apple.The iPhone 12 feels and looks premium and the iOS is a game changer compared to Android.Personally I prefer to purchase my phones out right than sign up to a 24 month contract. Depending on what sim deal you can find you could save around £400 to £600 over 2 years so it’s always worth checking.Overall it’s a great iPhone and looks fantastic in blue.!
"
3051,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Nothing new
"
3052,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
This is a perfect phone. Perfect size ,weight, smooth and elegant design. Impressive battery life for an above average user. I recommend a 256 GB. The only area I am very slightly disappointed is the screen response and touch ( typing) not bad though. I felt the phone is slightly overpriced from that perspective. I also recommend  a green one . And also,I think i phone 12 is the perfect one unless you are OK with very heavy and big phones. I felt like the money I spent on this phone is not useless.  Go ahead and get it. You will not be disappointed.
"
3053,B08L5RD3KR,4,"
Small improvement but does feel better to hold, the camera is miles ahead of the X too. Upgraded due to iphone X age had decreased perfomance, maybe hold out for next release if you are with an iphone x still
"
3054,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Having upgraded from an iPhone7 I’m absolutely loving the 12.  Have got used to facial recognition & swiping very quickly.  As always, transferring phone info over was very quick & simple.  I’ve watched a couple of YouTube videos to understand the extra/different functionality which has really helped.  Battery life is definitely much better than my 7.  All in all I’m very happy with the 12.
"
3055,B08L5RD3KR,3,"
Well its an ihpone yes. We know they hooked us on and now we are tied to the ever more expensive models. We know that Apple earns a  ... load of money with them.But to deliver the phone without any head phones at all now is mean. Its only topped by the fact that it is delivered without an operational charger either. A new cable type which would not fit into any old charger.  So please spend how much extra?Its like selling a car without tyresIt is disgraceful,  it should be illegal.
"
3056,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
I fell in love with the phone. But, my service provider couldn't facilitate eSIM. And it's very difficult to change eSIM for any emergency needs or we travel to other places and wants to use new SIM.Apple should have provided Dual Nano SIM's. eSIM's will be difficult process for everyone to get and configure it. I'm sure not even 0.5% of iPhone users are adaptive to eSIM.
"
3057,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Another year, another new iPhone and this time it is really a different from all iPhones before not only because supports 5G or of the new square design, but everything it’s new inside and out and looks and feels promising. Delivery from Amazon top notch only took 2 days. The phone itself works great, connectivity is much better than previous models and battery life is just as before, screen is crisp and colours are great, camera performance is excellent for day and night photos, stereo speakers are definitely the best of all phones I ever used,  they simply deliver immersive sound that matches cinema experience. All in all Best iPhone to date. Negative: well the price is on the higher end but we all know that.
"
3058,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Apple just keep making it easier to upgrade between their phones! The whole setup was effortless and face recognition is working well.This is the first time I’ve had an iPhone with no home button, but it’s very self explanatory and easy to use.
"
3059,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Upgraded from an iPhone 7 Plus and its so so much better. Crystal clear screen. Better cameras front and back. Face recognition is fantastic, So far battery life is excellent only having to charge at night and even then its maybe down to 40% after using a lot during the day. Wireless charging makes life easy once you have the charge pads/stands. Thought id miss the home button but No its an excellent phone.
"
3060,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
the last iphone i had was the iPhone 5SE.  I then decided to switch to android. I had two Android smartphones over the last few years, one midrange and one top range but i was increasingly feeling dissatisfied with the Android experience.i decided to upgrade to the latest iPhone and that decision has proved to be the right one.  i am very satisfied with the iPhone 12.  It is superb and thoroughly deserves to be called a smartphone.  I couldn't be more pleased with it.
"
3061,B08L5RD3KR,3,"
It is so pretty! the iphone 12’s design is so pretty in my personal opinion, it has amazing compatability with a lot of apps, the battery life seems good so far, i hope it stays like thatUpdate: Battery life has gone down so badly over the past year of having it, face ID has broken within 4-6 months of having the phone too 😐 Apple has gone downhill IMO, I've upgraded since
"
3062,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
had a old phone that was small so this one is much better because it has a bigger screen.i like apple phones so bought this one.
"
3063,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Everything good iPhones are a great bit of kit.
"
3064,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Is really comfortable when you hold it in your hand.in your pocket too. It has quite good camera. The battery is not that bad. I charge it once a day and is enough for me. I listen to a lot of music during the day.  This shows that it can handle daily tasks really easily.
"
3065,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Have been a Apple iPhone user for the last 10 years using a iPhone 6 which has never let me down, this upgrade to the 12 was a big step for me but after 3 weeks of using the new phone I am glad I purchased this phone it is fabulous and easy to use I would certainly recommend the iPhone 12.
"
3066,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Excellent, I bought this for my mom for mother's day and she is very happy with the product!
"
3067,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
It’s the first time to buy an Apple mobile phone on Amazon. I personally feel quite nervous, because I don’t know if it is really necessary to buy it on Amazon or go to the Apple store.  Start with the mobile phone, everything is normal, the quality is guaranteed and it is worth buying.
"
3068,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
I bought this for my wife to replace her 6S and she absolutely loves it.The camera is superb and so is the quality when watching videos on YouTube.It is a solid phone with superb features.The lack of a charger I feel is irrelevant as you can use your old chargers anyway and the battery life is a massive improvement.The lack of a headphone jack is also irrelevant to me as I bought an excellent adapter which works perfectly with wired headphones.
"
3069,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
I’d written off the idea of getting an iPhone after being disappointed with the iPhone 6 I had in the past but, after advice from family I ordered this and it’s perfect 👍
"
3070,B08L5RD3KR,3,"
The phone is great everything works fine just display is worse than on my iPhone 6s. A little yellowish. I was thinking to return it back but after I watched many videos on YouTube I decided to keep it as many people has similar problem. First time disappointed by Apple quality. Apple saying there’s nothing wrong with display it’s tuned by factory to yellowish tint and it’s still within specifications
"
3071,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
The only thing against this phone is my face's ability to either mute the sound or facetime someone mid-call.Apart from that battery life is excellent, face recognition is a real plus, and everything else works as well as you would expect an Apple product to.
"
3072,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
I’ve always been an android user however this year I decided to treat myself to this Apple iPhone and it has not disappointed me wish I made the switch sooner.
"
3073,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
My 8th iPhone and I couldn’t be happier. Got it at a good price. Purple is actually really nice. And it was £20 cheaper than the other colours.
"
3074,B08L5RD3KR,3,"
£750 overheats after playing cod for more than 30 mins, even with graphics set to low and frame rate set to medium. It may be graphically 40% faster but only when not playing games especially COD. Game plays better on a Samsung s8 which is 5 years old. Very very disappointed with playing games on this massively overpriced, over hyped iPhone.
"
3075,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Really substantial upgrade from my iPhone 8, which was already a fantastic piece of kit. Just miss the sleek, more compact profile of my old phone too... this one is chunky in comparison. Having said that, the battery life, camera and screen blow the iPhone 8 out of the water. It really is effortless to take great shots with these two cameras! The screen is just fantastic. Feels solid, which is good because it is going to be with me for a few years yet given how overpriced these things are.
"
3076,B08L5RD3KR,1,"
Bad experience getting this phone from amazon.  Call started to drop after a year. Amazon products support did not help keeping telling me the stuff which is common i.e restart the phin. Turn the aeroplane mode and then off etc. I have got the phone which doesn't work and have paid full price for it. Should have gone to Apple directly 🙄.
"
3077,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Bought this on Amazon. Great price compared with competitors. Great phone.
"

Excellent phone no problems easy to set up
"
3079,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Fantastic phone.  Went from iPhone 7 to this one and never looking back even though I loved my 7.  Would not have any other product than Apple simply the best.  So easy to use and everything just went from one phone to this other with no sweat or swearing!
"
3080,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
I’ve just upgraded from an iPhone 6 to this iPhone 12. Really pleased with it, very easy to use and very light. I am bias as I do prefer apple products to android.
"
3081,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Wonderful product and genuine without a doubt
"
3082,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
It arrived the next day. The phone is slightly smaller than my old iPhone 8 Plus but it fits better in my hand now. The resolution is visibly better, not quite used to the face recognition yet but I’m sure I will get the hang of it
"
3083,B08L5RD3KR,4,"
Coming from an old ‘window’ based phone, I found the iPhone great to use.. although not as intuitive to set up or find my way around.
"
3084,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Great phone. Snappy sharp and feels like good high-end quality. I really like it. It’s actually a perfect screen size for functionality in all senses for everyone. Not too big, and not too small, perfect for general use; browsing, Instagram, etc and brilliant OLED screen for Netflix with support for Dolby Vision. It is bright and responsive and fast in all conditions, including sunlight viewing. Do genuinely recommend, even though it’s a bit pricey.

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 The appearance of the iphone 12 series has changed alot this time,the camera has also been enchanced a lot.The calculation and software have improved a lot, which is really great.especially the night shot taking is really good you can feel it on the screen,its tough level.If you are pursuing excellent camera functions and like Apple highly integrated ecological chain,then iphone 12 series is a very good choice and the choice will not make u regret it.Sending by my iphone12🥰🥰
"
3087,B08L5RD3KR,4,"
Overall the IPhone 12 is a great phone bug like most apple products, you pay more for the apple logo on the back than the technology itself.
"
3088,B08L5RD3KR,4,"
Used product to get 5G , before this phone I use to have I phone x not much differenceThanks
"
3089,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Very clear picture and comprises incredible features, very nice with long life battery.
"
3090,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
I am an Apple devotee, so, perhaps, slightly biased. As with all of the Apple products I have owned, superbly well made. Works and integrates with my other Apple products. Technology as it should be, in my view. One criticism, battery life could be better, but, I do get by with one charge per day.
"
3091,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Had it for two days now, used it constantly and only had to charge it once! I got in it purple and it’s really pretty, not too big which is nice and with a lot of nice features.
"
3092,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Bought this as soon as the iphone 13 was released because I knew the price would drop on the 12 and they would sell out quick. I was right.  Bought for a christmas present so haven't opened it.

3093,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
My last phone A Siemens M60 20+ yo on same battery served me well and is still working but buttons starting to stick This is a replacement and obviously things have moved on needed a push to upgrade (family) but got my own back by getting them to tutor me in its use

Easy to set up and well described
"
3095,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Easy to use.  This is my first iPhone in over ten years and it’s lovely to use.  Takes amazing pictures.  Face ID - wow.  It just works.  Amazing.  Love the colour.After using this for a few days I’m not really sure I’ll go back to android
"
3096,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
This is definitely the best iPhone I've owned and I've had them all since the iPhone 4 great build quality great battery life the screen looks amazing the stereo speakers are great too. The iPhone 12 doesn't come with charger or headphones which is a little disappointing but I use a wireless charger anyway so it didn't bother me . I usually go with product red but it looked a bit orange this year so got the blue version and I'm glad I did it looks stunning
"
3097,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Great everyday phone. One of the best iPhone I have had and used not to talk about the camera quality it’s absolutely great quality and battery life.
"
3098,B08L5RD3KR,4,"
Got this for my wife for Christmas and she's enjoyed using it so far.However as a Samsung Galaxy S fan, I must say that a 60fps screen is a bit strange for flagship tier phones in 2020/21.
"
3099,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Love this phone and all my information took juts few minutes to go over this new phone I was pretty relieved I had visions of losing my music and photos I bought the white and I love it
"
3100,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
I love the way the phone itself is very colourful and I love all of the features including the face recognition and the layout of the apps is great. I absolutely love the screen size and it is just the right size to fit in your pocket
"
3101,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Amazing
"

Amazing phone, great looking and easy to use. Camera is also top quality. My first iPhone, always been a android guy but this has been a breath of fresh air and a good change.
"
3103,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
The Iphone12 is the best of the Iphones so far but the price is expensive ! However buying a sim free phone is cheaper in the long run as your not tied in on any contract! I am very happy with this phone you can do so much with it !
"
3104,B08L5RD3KR,3,"
Frankly it was not much of an improvement on my IPhone 7, which my wife now has. The challenge of transferring data is far worse than the Apple solution suggests as it does not transfer music not bought from Apple. In addition, the developers seem to live in their own world which assumes that users are all geeks.
"

My another iPhone ... I have to say it's below expectations battery so weak som app lag , yes nice design good photos but again display so dark in day light so so waste money hopefully my kid will won't for professional user wrong choice .

Good

Not very good sound compared to Dolby on android but it is half the price of a top Samsung galaxy.Also could do with clearer display a bit of a let down but some apps are better and cheap for a 5 g mobile

cool!!!!

Rip off. As has been said before, the lack of a charger is a total scam from Apple. Yes, Apple, you are reducing your carbon footprint and all that, but at the same time you are also making a tonne more revenue from accessory sales. If it was a genuine move, you'd supply a voucher code entitling buyers to order a charger for free. And the design to include a USB C cable? I mean what wall sockets have USB C? None. Who has a tonne of USB A power adaptors knocking around? Everyone. Simply including a cable that connects the phone to USB A would alleviate this issue, but no Apple in their wisdom assumes USB C is fine.I have  Macbook Pro which is generally fine and a phone could plug into that to charge, but I bought the phone for my teenage son. He'd never have an previous adaptor to use. I saw the light and switched to Samsung S series phones years ago. So his birthday present was almost useless out of the box - I wasn't even offered an upsell to get a charger at time of sale. I anticipate alot of moaning  in the coming days as he slowly starts to realise other short comings of this overpriced phone, but for me the no charger/USB C cable thing is a complete joke. AVOID!

5G on and off, used usb leads to charge which made sound muted, phone keep going headphones mode despite no headphones were attached. Requires phone to restart. Did not find Apple standard except the price which was as high as for Apple products.

The set up I had to do twice so make sure you update your old iPhone first. No instructions in box but lots of hints on phone. Took a while to work stuff out.
"
3116,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Everything about this phone is easy and very classy. It looks so very nice, easy to use, and a simple process transferring from one phone to another. I would recommend it to anyone.

 I bought this for my dad's birthday , the product description suggested its a ""New iPhone 12 128GB"", however it arrived in a brown Amazon box with bubble wraps inside. It didn't come with the official apple boxing and I have checked the serial number it was a refurbished iPhone.Won't recommend, this is not a brand new iPhone.
"
3119,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
I was impressed with the delivery service, the phone arrived within 24hrs. Xfer of data from my iphone 6 was easy. Good phone at reasonable price.
"
3120,B08L5RD3KR,1,"
I purchased this for 650 which is the same as apple store price for a new iPhone. This was advertised as new. However in the confirmation email it said old- like new. Battery life 98%. I immediately cancelled the delivery.
"
3121,B08L5RD3KR,3,"
Okay - lots of good stuff: great camera, great speakers, amazing screen etc.  But one huge flaw: one of the points of upgrading to 5G is that you should be able to ditch your wifi (provided you're in a 5G area).  But, you can't, and here's why: you cannot back up your phone using 5G.  This makes no sense, as 5G is often faster than wifi.  So, that means I can't cancel my wifi that's costing me £35 a month - just to back up my iPhone!
"
3122,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
It does what is written in the description.
"
3123,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
I love this phone , the photo quality and edits are amazing.
"
3124,B08L5RD3KR,2,"
I never write reviews on amazon, this is my first but I felt it was necessary as the iPhone 12 is an expensive product and I had high expectations for it. Undoubtedly Apple will launch and revision but for those of you who are thinking of buying this product, perhaps wait until everyone else who has ""tested"" this product for apple and exposed the bugs have helped refine the next version.Here are the issues I am experiencing:- Phone network reception just drops sporadically and does not restore itself, you need to restart the phone- Copy and paste does not work- The face recognition is not user friendly due to face masks or sunglasses, the thumb reader would be better under the circumstancesIf any of the above is a concern for you, consider something else.

Very happy with iPhone also safe
"
3132,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
I was hesitant at first with the price.I have always had Samsung mobiles but decided to buy Apple this time and what a excellent hand set this is.The operating system and performance it gives that’s why it’s one of the best iPhones on the market.
"
3133,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Easy to setup and so many more facilities available on this version to my previous phone. Good buy and price comparison matches any other companies.

Can’t fault it . Photo id and Apple Pay are super easy to use! For some reason I expected iPhone 12 battery to last all day while watching videos which didn’t happen !

"
3145,B08L5RD3KR,1,"
I decided to upgrade from iPhone XR recently to IPhone 12, as I was led to believe the iPhone 12 had battery life/efficiency.Normal use on my previous IPhone XR would take my battery life up to late evening from a full charge the previous night, which I was more than happy with.Same charge on this IPhone 12 from Amazon gets me to about lunchtime. Totally disappointed in this product to say the least.  I’ve lost all confidence in purchasing from Amazon.I was led to believe the iPhone 12 had a so much better battery efficiency which was the reason of my purchase/upgrade.I can only assume this ‘new’ phone is a refurbished phone that no one else wanted and /or returned.I’m actually trying to finish this review before the battery runs out.  I kid you not.If I could give this review zero stars I would.Note to self==========Always go straight to Apple for Apple products, especially with the costs involved.  Never going to Amazon again for Apple products.

Replacement for iphone8. Took a bit of time to get used to different controls - eg no home button, but now love it. Combined with ios14 so easy to use. The only problem is it won’t recognise my face when I have a face mask on!
"
3149,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
iPhones are so easy to use the battery life is good  pleased with purchase
"
3150,B08L5RD3KR,1,"
Let me repeat, it didn't last 1, single, solitary week.Not 1.It didn't last 3 days.It lasted... 2... kinda.Galway through the second it started turning off with no warning.No problem, I'll just send it back... nah... Amazon don't like that. It's been over a month. I've talked to Amazon support more times in that period than I'd like to admit, more than I have to my grandparents. And they refuse to issue a refund. So, I have paid eight hundred pounds for the oh so enviable opportunity to peruse the Amazon support pages and struggle with their support team.The phone is probably fine but, and I can't stress this enough:DO NOT BUY THIS FROM AMAZON!Buy it from someone who accepts in person returns, like Apple or Curry's.AVOID AMAZON'S CUSTOMER SUPPORT AT ALL (and I do mean ALL) COSTS!
"
3151,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Love the face recognition, battery life and so easy to use. I wouldn’t be without it. Well worth the expense best decision ever to change my phone.

Bought this phone from Amazon on Prime Day - from a market place 3rd party seller sold 'via Amazon' and sadly discovered the phone had a 3rd party camera added to the phone and then sold as brand new.How do we know? - Apple confirmed that the serial number of the camera was not a genuine Apple camera serial number when they ran diagnostics and so this phone camera will never work and this iPhone was corrupted despite being sold as brand new boxed and wrapped. I will never buy an Apple phone or high-value phone from Amazon but only from the direct Apple shop - in the future. I would advise anyone to proceed with caution after my experience.Amazon has refunded me the cost of this phone.  Amazon is as always, excellent for their customer service so 5* for Amazon!  I am sorry that Amazon has such tricky sellers using their platform. It damages their reputation.

The phone developed a hardware fault within 30 days,contacted Amazon and was asked to return the phone for repair,almost 3 weeks later it was returned to me still in the same condition,took it to Apple which I should have done in the first place and it was repaired within the hourHave to say Amazon’s handling of this has been appalling I won’t be purchasing any more Apple products anytime soon
"
3304,B08L5RD3KR,1,"
After less than 3 months the screen suddenly died. It’s now unusable and I’m told I need to spend £280 to get it fixed. Apparently the screen isn’t covered by the warranty. Absolutely disgusting, I’ll never buy another Apple product again. Not fit for purpose

We upgrade our phones so you can expect better speed, better camera and better network, however, believe me, there is no difference whatsoever from iPhone 11 to 12, I have the disconnection issue since day one and its just worse than the iPhone 11I have found no speed difference with this upgrade and I have found that 11 camera is even better than 12 !!!  what is going on with Apple, they are just giving us the same old things in a new package !

Brand new phone, neary £700, it hardly holds a charge and takes 20 minutes to charge 5%.Apple checked the phone and said they would have provided a refund if I'd purchased with them, but as it's over 30 days old and I bought via Amazon, I'm offered the option of a 'repair'.Brand new phone, hardly used, needs to be repaired.I will never, ever buy an Apple product via Amazon again.

I recently purchased iphone 12 128 GB from amazon. I was excited to have this phone as it looks amazing and feels awesome in hand. However, Its battery doesn't lasted more than 4 hours of screen time. I am not sure if its just with me. I return this item to amazon and after 12 Days of returning this item finally I got my refund.I am disappointed with Iphone12 battery and amazon return service.

Bought this expensive phone, kept freezing. Within 1 month it failed completely and it seems you don’t get a refund but a repair which can take 2 weeks. Had to buy another phone and now have no confidence in the iPhone 12 and would rather have had a refund.
"
3327,B08L5RD3KR,2,"
I thought I would upgrade from my XS Max to the iPhone 12. But I found out I had actually downgraded. I wouldn't go this route again.

The problem is Amazon delivery .. they say next day delivery but in fact you will never know. Their drivers play hide & seek .. very unreliable. My advise buy from a decent outlet .. not Amazon.

3329,B08L5RD3KR,1,"
Phone arrived quickly.  After a few days the phone shut down and would not power back up.  Tried restart procedure but nothing so requested a return.  Item was returned with proof of postage on 28th June and still awaiting a refund.

I bought it 2-3 months ago but now the battery life decreased from 100% to 99%.

The signal drops out constantly when I’m trying to make calls and the internet looses its signal too. Keep needed to restart the phone which for the amount payed it is laughable.

3332,B08L5RD3KR,1,"
The screen quality and battery life is not as good as the XR. Also, so many qliches and freezing that the xR never had.I’d go for the xR or 11 for a cheaper price and not an oled screen.
"
3333,B08L5RD3KR,1,"
I was highly surprised that Amazon would hide information about warranty on the listing page for iPhones bought from Amazon Warehouse.Also, an iPhone which is in ""Very Good"" condition could be a renewed one!!!

Do not buy, it’s not a new phone 12, arrived with the iPhone packaging removed, asked Amazon to sort it our told I have to wait three weeks don’t waste your money

The seller does not indicate the region of manufacture. The one i ordered was manufactured in Canada, which is why I can't loyalty cards to Apple Pay in the UK. My credit card works fine, so I have no complaints.

Phone quality is no better than Cheaper brands. Waste of money
"
3347,B08L5RD3KR,1,"
It’s a great phone but it packed in working after 16 months - 4 months out of warranty. Apple want £465 to fix it even though they haven’t opened it to see what’s wrong. I’m hoping Amazon replace it under their 2 year warranty or I’ll have to invoke my consumer protection rights. £750 is a lot of money for something that stopped working after less than 2 years. Cosmetically it’s 100%. Not dropped or wet.Just waiting for Amazon to get back to my son, who bought me it as a special present.Gutted!

This phone i have only had a day and i have seen vast improvements to the older version of this phone and arguably the building blocks for this phone the iPhone 11. I bought the iPhone 11 and it was the replacement to my old iPhone XR. after having this phone for the short while i have the phone i have seen many aspects which make the upgrade worth it. This iPhone for starters has 5G and the phone also has a better chip. This Iphone has a new technology called super retina XDR display and this display is much better than the ones on the XR and 11 as they didn't even have the same pixel density as the iPhone 6! the other improvement is the the curved edges and this may sound like a weird point. However the phone is better looking and is more grippy to your hand, it also makes the phone feel newer as the older phones had slight curves in the screen which now look outdated. The sound quality is about the same as the 11 with stereo speakers. The next thing to point out is the bold colour choices, you can get plain white or black but there is also a purple, blue, green and red edition as well. I picked the blue colour and it is like a deep impact blue to the like of the blue you see many fords painted in the UK. The red is a slight salmon colour and you will think the phone is quite coral. the green is nice and looks minty. However the purple is a candy floss like colour and is a bold choice. However i don't think you will regret buying the purple one!. The last point of my review is the storage option and the base amount is 64GB and this is not enough if you have a lot of music and photos and apps then you will want the 128GB version at an extra £50 to the base model. if you are a hardcore Iphone user and feel as if you need 256GB of storage then my advice would be not to buy the basic 12 and get the Pro or pro max and get the upgraded storage option. Yes you will pay a bit more however you will not regret it as the pro and the pro max add a ton more features and have the more classy stainless steel bands and have 3 cameras. So thats my advice hope it helps!

I've always had cheaper Android phones, never wanted to spend Apple money. Not against the brand, but I don't like having expensive kit in my pocket. (I've had an old apple Ipad for years, so I'm not scared of Apple). Anyway, more recently I upgraded from a Huawei p20 lite - a £200 phone) to an Iphone 11, mainly driven by the better camera and thought It’s about time I treated myself to something a little more expensive, as I've never broken or lost a phone in my pocket.2 Weeks in and I'm still getting frustrated, I just can’t do the things I would expect from a phone!My main gripes are:*I have 25 Gb of photos on my Android, I just want to move them over. I don’t want my photos on the cloud, I have enough backups. I just want them physically on the iPhone. it seems the latest ios has blocked direct transfer from Windows (I can see the file, just cant paste to it). All other routes are extremely painful. Just let me drag and drop please!!!*Same goes in reverse – considering the main reason I bought the phone was for the camera. I own my photos, why can’t I just easily take them off my phone. I don’t want them in the cloud, I don’t want them hidden when I delete them. I want direct access to my own files please.*This was my first IPhone, so I was expecting the transition to be nice. Open the box and no USB adapter??? There is a USB C lead, but who has a USB C charger? All my wall plates around the house are USB A. My car is USB A. My PC is USB A. great, so I need to spend another £20 to use my phone, and another £20 updating all my leads in my car, at work etc.*To the above point, why isn’t this just a USB C standard?*If transferring photos is difficult, everything else seems impossible. Absolutely no visibility of folder structure in windows.*The phone is bulkier and a lot heavier than my P30 lite, and so far I haven't seen anything to benefit the extra mass or bulk.I really wanted to love this phone, but so far all I want to do is just return it and go back to my old phone which is 1/3 of the price.

Finally upgraded from iPhone 6s. Loving the speed, the screen, the camera’s Bokeh feature. Great phone. Bought it from John Lewis. To my disappointment they further reduced the price 2 days later. BUT I discovered they actually price match themselves and they gave me a refund of the difference - no quibbles. Excellent!
"
3353,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Love this new phone. Not had an apple iPhone before. It’s easy to use still learning about it but delighted with it so far.
"
3354,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
My first iPhone since the iPhone 6, so far I am very happy with it. Coming from android I was happy with the The user layout. It is very intuitive and easy to navigate the build quality of the phone is very sturdy and light but so light it’s at risk of feeling “cheap”. This is really nitpicking. The phone’s snappy response means all tasks I throw at it are carried out smoothly and effortlessly.Bad points: no charger is a pain in the backside! Not having a usb c powerbrick to hand meant I had to revert to an old iPad charger I luckily had. Why they went for a lightning port to usb C I will never know as it is the most pointless and least available connection. (At least to me) I have now swapped back to a lightning to usb 2.0 and normality is restored (yes the charging is not as fast anymore) overall a good purchase in my opinion but I might not be able to say the same If I was coming from an iPhone 11 or similar.Overall, a good phone to consider if you are due an upgrade or like me have an older phone dying a horrid death! I’m sure there’s others out there who will say Android is better and to be quite honest I believe both have their flaws and benefits.
"
3355,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Ignore the reviews from people who haven’t bought one, that’s laughable. Yes the phone doesn’t come with headphones or a power plug but it’s hard to believe you would really need another power plug if you’re in the market for this phone. Just wasted plastic at this point. Having said that I did upgrade to a usb-c power plug and it charges from dead to full in 1hr 30 and fast charges to 50% in 30 minutes, the battery also holds charge a lot longer than a phone you’re likely to be upgrading from like an old 7, 8, X. The most impressive feature is the camera with night mode and wide angle. The Oled screen is also stunning especially if you turn the lights off and watch a Dolby vision video. This will be the phone that people own for 5+ years without needing an upgrade. When you think the iPhone X was released at £1000, this is a much more refined product and coming in £200 cheaper.
"
3356,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
Absolutely love this phone and have no issues with the product itself. Word of warning though: if you don't own an Apple computer, you will need to purchase additional accessories separately. The lightning cable included in the box has a USB-C connector which can't be plugged into a standard Windows PC or plug from an older iPhone model.

Upgrading from the XR you see the difference between  4g and 5G. Overall the design on the apps and UI (user interface ) feels nicer to the eye and more snappy the oled screen is great for dark gritty films. Despite its price and apples ups and downs with privacy and god knows what else the phone delivers on many fronts however the worst part of the product lies with the battery. I hope one day I could make my battery last a week without a charge, I don’t use it too much and it lasts roughly 3 days but while at work I have to charge it every morning

I had struggled along for a while with my old 6s. Big mistake. Bought the twelve after reading all the reviews of 11-13.  Very easy to set up from cloud. Love the magnetic cordless charging.

Didn’t like the price but who does lol. Love the phone, great functionality, good size to see/hold and crystal clear screen etcMost people who buy these have already looked up the spec so I won’t go into that side, but I do know you will enjoy using this beautiful phone and all it’s features.There are some cheaper very good phones out there, but I like the reliability of Apple phones and they are always in good enough working condition to pass down to grandchildren when you upgrade

It was time to retire my 6s after many years of loyal service.I kept waiting for Apple to bring the fingerprint back but as it wasn’t happening got this one.Great phone otherwise but the face recognition doesn’t work half the time. It’s a problem in the shops, in the dark, when wearing a hat and sunglasses and sometimes just for no reason at all. Please bring back the fingerprint!Why Apple and not Samsung or any other phone brand? Cause of security! And because they stand up to Facebook and other companies that want your private data to sell you more stuff and make money off of you! Google for example should give their phones to people for free seeing how much they “spy” on their users.

I am an iPhone user and I’ve had iPhones since the 3G version many, many years ago.This is my 1st with an OLED screen. For me personally, iPhones have gotten a bit chunky over the last few years and have gotten thicker each year since the 6 and 6S.The iPhone 12 is only 7.4mm thick with a super glossy 6.1“ screen which reminds me of the iPhone 4 with its straight aluminium sides and for me it’s perfect.I have small hands and this is probably a little bit big for me to use comfortably but I think that 6.1” is the perfect size screen for trolling the net and using Safari so I’ll put up with having to use 2 hands every now and then.The battery is comparable to the XR I had previously and the blue colour matches my Apple Watch 6 perfectly.I bought the 128gb version to help with resale prices next year but 64GB for me would have been enough as I still have 102gb free after 2 months use. (As a guide I have 79 songs, 3 videos and 169 photos, I’m certainly not a heavy user! )If you are reading this and are thinking of buying one, the iPhone 13 will be out in a few months and it’s expected to have a slightly faster processor and a different camera arrangement and new colours. It may be the 12S, it may be the 13, but in my opinion you can always miss a year out.This phone is well made, takes great photos and has a sublime screen with iMessage as well as 5G (which I’ve tried using O2) and the benefit of the best App Store in the world. Buy it and enjoy the Apple experience.

 I have an iphone 11 and am very happy with it, I purchased an iphone 12 for my wife as a Birthday present and have been comparing the 2 phones, I really like feel of the iphone 11 which is an aluminium frame the iphone 12 does not have the same premium feel, it is a lot lighter in the hand, the 11 has rounded edges whereas the 12 has flat.Speed wise using you cannot tell a difference, we are both using 4G, when my wife changes her contract and opts for one with 5G her smartphone will be a lot faster.Both smartphones outperform the cheaper brands when receiving text messages, and Whatsapp and also email messages.

With modern technology you can do so much. This phone even though it's not the latest one has all the tech stuff you need. I'm not going to explain everything it can do but what's described in the description part is what it can do. A good phone.

I don’t  know what's going on with my iphone. Some apps stop working normally for a few minutes and today, out of nowhere it was running half a screen for a few seconds and restarted alone. However, I want a new device and not have it repaired because I bought it on March 24th. I await answers and that my problem is solved. Thanks.

Expensive? Battery sucks! This is too old now. This is £559.99 now but it can be cut-price on sale for 3percent, not £629.99 is scam.

iPhone 12 is so easy to open using face recognition , compared with the iPhone 7 with finger print opening , which never works!

Great phone, amazing screen and just easy to use. Best feature of iPhones is the software and all the integrations with Apple products. I personally would have liked a bigger battery as it goes down relatively fast when using 5g during the day. But overall I must admit that for the average user (me) iPhone never lets you down.

Overpriced hype. Can’t see any difference between this and the iPhone 8. Not worth upgrading or maybe try Samsung. I think I will.
"
3408,B08L5RD3KR,5,"
There are plenty of reviews for iPhone 12's out there so I'll stick to the Amazon experience. The price undercuts purchasing direct. One day later I got a SIM-free iPhone 12 in the branded box ready to stick my own SIM straight in. Worked like a dream and I spent less than buying direct - especially as I was happy to get the blue as it was a bit cheaper for some reason (but who cares when it spends all its life in a case!).

Apple prices are always high in comparison with other iPhones, and Apple is mean with supplying essential accessories, like charging connectors. However, this is made up ( I think ), by quality, design and after sales service as well as providing at east 5 years of critical updates.

I like everything about the pro max battery lasts all day no problem, face recognition works great a fast and the screen is 10/10.

This iPhone is a huge step up from any other I’ve ever seen or used and I’ve had iPhones since the iPhone 3g. The camera is stunning and I’m a semi-professional photographer. I’m not going into a deep review of it all but suffice to say it really does live up to the hype for once, and that’s rare!The screen is stunningly clear and simply gorgeous to look at. The whole phone really makes the very most of the latest iOS 16.1 operating system but by the time you read this it will have been developed even further for sure. Using this phone is just a dream and if you’re in a 5G area, you will be blown away by its speed.This is technology at its very best and if you want the best mobile phone available today, I heartily recommend you go for this. It even has a battery that will get you through an entire long day! Not that it matters too much as I can charge mine from empty to 80% in under an hour.This isn’t the place for the kind of review this phone deserves but I can say with confidence you will not regret buying it.As a side issue, my friend and I ordered our phones on the exact same day, he from Apple and me from Amazon. I got my phone at least two weeks before he did!

 Upgraded from 12 pro max, & it was a genuine improvement. The notch has gone & has been replaced by a much smaller version, but with a mini screen/readout. Cameras are vastly improved along with screen & refresh rate.  Not impressed with the new esim!! Couldn’t put old sim in this latest apple effort & get it up & running straight away. Now having to figure out how to transfer my old number?!

When I first got the iPhone 14 pro max it was fantastic but just after one week sometimes the screen doesn’t respond and is very frustrating closing down the app and reopen it just to get it working .all in all this phone is not worth the money and the only difference in the pictures it takes is only noticeable when you crop the picture so unless your a photographer but then you would have a decent camera it don’t make any sense to get this phone and the always on bit I switched off lol

I’m gonna be realI’ve come from some generations behind but notice nothing yeah the dynamic island is cool and speaks that this is the new phone but you’ll never use it past answering calls and media playback….the phone is neverchanging and thus you end up with a reshaped version of the same thing we been getting since the iPhone 11Say what you will but the phone is mid, the delivery waiting time is beyond words (not at all worth waiting months for rather get another phone)And thus in conclusion ….. think carefully before spending on this it all depends on your financial standing and value of this productBless up fellow mindless consumers !

So after a good few years of Samsung phones, we return to Apple, and what a huge disappointment. Forget that the Samsung Galaxy S22 is an Android phone and not iOS (duh!), it's so much smaller, so comparing the two is exactly fair, but the idea was that Apple's flagship would exceed Samsung, it simply doesn't. The camera was worse for us too, but maybe for others, it isn't. As for iOS, yes is speedy, very swish, and the battery life is really good. But those were the only two positives for us. The display on the Samsung still stuns, the display on this iPhone is nothing bad, but nothing special either, for this much money, better was not just expected, it was a necessity. This review will probably get a 1000 downvotes, but we felt conned buying this by reviewers raving about it, are they all paid to do so? Sold it three weeks later and went back to the S22 Ultra. Lost £100 in the process, so not happy about that. If you're thinking of buying one, try the S22 Ultra, unless you're locked into iOS, it will impress.

This iPhone is the same built from the iPhone 12 Pro Max. The only difference between them is iPhone 14 pro max has Dynamic Island not the notch.  And Always-On display AndProMotion technology with adaptive refresh rates up to 120Hz. Apart from that you are buying  the phone twice. Just minor upgrades. Apple need to innovate.
"
3453,B0BDHTRL5X,1,"
This review is not about the phone quality, it is about Apples customer service. I ordered the iPhone 14 Pro Max on 19th September and the money was taken a few days later on 23rd.Delivery was shown as by 23rd October. It is now 27th October and the delivery info has changed to ‘we will email you when it is in stock’.It’s bad enough having these extended waiting times, but what other business takes the full payment with no realistic delivery time for the item?You can’t even contact them!
"
3454,B0BDHTRL5X,1,"
Basically the same as the previous phone. no need to upgrade.
"
3455,B0BDHTRL5X,5,"
Amazing screen, volume clarity improved, CAMERA SYSTEM is the best. Every shot you click, it's gonna be the best shot you've ever clicked on any mobile phones.Dynamic Island is simply superb, while listening to music, receiving air drops, ring/silent. On every action you do , the island responds and it's styles are good.On a last note, it's the beast.

It has a nice feel to it the screen brightness is very good and fast to open the app and closing the app.I did not like waiting 10 weeks to receive my iPhone it should have been shipped to me by the 28/09 not the 1/12.I have used iPhone 13pro max the performance wise their is not much of a different between 14pro max to 13pro max some one who going use it day to day doze not care for the brightness of screen or the dynamic island if you can get a good deal on a 13pro max go for it.

Nachdem ich ein iPhone 12 Pro Max von Herbst 2020 in Verwendung habe, bei dem mir die Speicherkapazität langsam nicht mehr ausreicht und ich die Video-Verbesserungen seit dem iPhone 13 Pro interessant finde, ist jetzt die Zeit für ein neues iPhone.Das iPhone 14 Pro Max ist wieder sehr hochwertig verarbeitet und weiter im bewerten Design seit dem iPhone 12, dass schon an Generationen 4 bis iPhone 5S erinnert.Für mich wichtigste Neuerungen: -Haupt-Kamera deutlich verbessert mit bis zu 48 Megapixel! Allerdings im Alltag nur weiterhin 12 Megapixel und somit wohl kaum Größenunterschied der Dateien. Gut, denn wer mehr Pixel voll ausnutzen will, kann auf RAW umstellen (viel Bearbeitungs-Potential, aber riesige Dateien), bei normalen Fotos hingegen wird einfach die Qualität verbessert.  Die Brennweite entspricht jetzt einem 24mm, also etwas mehr Weitwinkel (13 Pro: 26mm).-Ultraweitwinkel-Kamera verbessert, soll auch bei Macro-Aufnahmen besser sein-2fach Zoom wieder da: Wie beim iPhone XS kann man nun wieder auch 2fach Zoom optisch nutzen - ein Bildausschnitt der Hauptkamera statt eine eigene Linse. Nachteil: Vermutlich weniger Qualität bei schwierigerem Licht, als bei 3x-Kamera-Super Retina XDR Display: Das Display soll sich noch weiter verbessert haben. Es scheint mit enorm brillant und scharf. In hellen Umgebungen soll es sogar bis zu 2000 Nits Helligkeit bieten, also auch bei starker Sonneneinstrahlung noch hell genug sein (bis zu doppelt so hell wie vorherige iPhones). Allerdings kann sich das Display bei warmer Umgebung und gleichzeitigem Laden per Powerbank etc. eventuell dimmen und nicht mehr die volle Helligkeit bieten, das fand ich beim 12 Pro Max problematisch und kann es bisher beim 14 Pro Max noch nicht beurteilen.-Neuer Prozessor bzw. Chip mit vermutlich etwas mehr Leistung, im Vergleich zum normalen iPhone 14, das weiterhin mit dem Prozessor vom Vorjahr kommt (nur 1 Grafikkern mehr ist im normalen iPhone 14 nutzbar nutzbar, wie beim 13 Pro).-Always-On Display: Wie der Name sagt, kann das Display permanent an bleiben und bei niedriger Bild-Wiederholrate energiesparend Infos anzeigen. Kann z.B. am Schreibtisch auf einem Ladeständer ganz praktisch sein… Wenn man das iPhone umdreht oder in die Tasche steckt, sollte sich das Display aber nach wie vor ganz abschalten.-Dynamic Island: Statt der bisherigen Frontkamera- und Gesichtserkennungs-Einbuchtung am oberen Displayrand, gibt es jetzt eben einen kleineren, abgetrennten Bereich, der zusätzlich rundherum den Display-Bereich einbindet, um Infos wie Musikwiedergabe etc. anzuzeigen. Eine nette Spielerei, die aktuell nur der 14 Pro-Serie vorbehalten ist.-Kinomodus (für Videoaufnahme) weiter verbessert und in 4KVorteile im Vergleich zu älteren Geräten (für alle, die überlegen, umzusteigen):-LiDAR Scanner (seit 12 Pro): Zukunftssicherer -ein großer Vorteil für Fotografie und Filmen bei wenig Licht, verbessert den Auto-Fokus der Kamera. Außerdem wird es vermutlich zunehmend mehr AR-Anwendungen etc. geben, welche von dem neuen Scanner gebrauch machen können.-Ultra-Weitwinkel-Kamera zusätzlich im Vergleich zu iPhone XS oder älter-Tele-Objektiv mit 3 fachem „Zoom“ zum im Vergleich zum iPhone 12 Pro (Max) (2,5fach Zoom) oder nur 2 fache „Zoom“ bei iPhone XS oder älter-Fotoqualität bei wenig Licht noch mal deutlich verbessert, im Vergleich zu älteren iPhones (Generation XS und abwärts) finde ich den Unterschied gigantisch, besonders auch bei Videoaufnahmen in Dämmerung… seit dem iPhone 12 noch einiges verbessert.-Kamera im 14 Pro Max sensorstabilisiert -also noch besserer Schutz vor Verwackeln bzw. Vorteile für Videoaufnahmen. Ein großer Vorteil zu älteren Generationen vor iPhone 12-Action Modus: Für Videoaufnahmen in Bewegung eine deutliche Verbesserung, seit iPhone 13 Pro (Max), kann manchmal einen Gimbal einsparen… allerdings nicht bei voller Auflösung.-In bis zu 1 TB Kapazität erhältlich, seit dem iPhone 13 Pro (Max)-Apple ProRAW-Foto-Unterstützung (seit iPhone 12 Pro). Man kann in der Nachbearbeitung mehr mit den Fotos machen (Farben anpassen etc.), allerdings deutlich größere Speichergröße. Natürlich jederzeit umschaltbar.-ProRes und Dolby Vision HDR Video: Lässt sich aktivieren um extrem hochwertige, gut bearbeitbare Videos aufzunehmen, z.B. ideal für Nutzer, die danach in Final Cut Pro schneiden möchten etc… Natürlich entsprechend hoher Speicherbedarf.  Verfügbar seit iPhone 13 Pro bzw. 12 Pro bei Dolby Vision HDR.-6 GB Arbeitsspeicher (RAM) -kein Fortschritt im Vergleich zu den Vorgängern seit iPhone 12, aber im Vergleich zu älteren iPhones (vor 12) oder Nicht-Pro Modellen.-lange Zeit Updates: Im Vergleich zu den meisten Android-Geräten wesentlich längere Unterstützung von neuen Betriebssystem-Versionen mit vielen neuen Funktionen und sogar darüber Hinaus noch Sicherheitsupdates.-iOS entwickelt sich zunehmend weiter und bringt jedes Jahr wesentliche Neuerungen auch für alte Geräte.-Guter Wasser-Schutz (nach IP 68) -seit dem iPhone 12 eine deutliche Verbesserung zu Vorgängern-5G-Unterstützung: Wer noch iPhones vor der 12. Generation nutzt, der bekommt hier auch eine interessante Verbesserung-Akku-Laufzeit im Max macht auf mich einen guten Eindruck. Ein ganzes Stück besser, als in der normalen Pro-Version… bisher konnte ich kaum Unterschiede zu älteren Max-Modellen feststellen.-MagSafe: magnetisches System zum Anschluss von Qi-Ladegeräten und anderem Zubehör an der Rückseite, seit dem iPhone 12 verbaut. Seit 2 Jahren erscheint immer mehr nützliches MagSafe-Zubehör, wie Auto-Halter, Ständer, Wallets und vieles mehr…-ein wenig größeres Display als etwas ältere Vorgänger-Modelle (11 Pro Max,  XS Max) - aber auch etwas größeres GehäuseNachteile:-Noch kein neuester WLAN-Standard wie 6E, immer noch die selbe maximale Geschwindigkeit und der selbe Standard wie schon seit Jahren, dadurch nicht so zukunftssicher-Leider immer neue Gehäusegrößen - so passen alte Hüllen nicht mehr… (MagSafe-Zubehör wie Wallet oder Ständer sind allerdings mit allen iPhones ab 12 kompatibel)-Kein Kopfhörer-Anschluss, wie schon seit dem iPhone 7. Kabel-Kopfhörer/Headsets lassen sich aber einfach per Lightning auf Klinke-Adapter anstecken, oder Zubehör direkt mit Lightning-Stecker (z.B. Apple EarPods).-Face ID im Vergleich zu Geräten mit Home-Button: Manchmal wäre das Entsperren mit dem Fingerabdruck-Sensor praktischer, wenn das iPhone z.B. flach am Tisch liegt. Das hat Apple am iPad Air im seitlichen Knopf integriert. Fände ich zusätzlich zu Face ID sehr wünschenswert.-Kein Netzteil/Ladegerät mehr im Lieferumfang seit iPhone 12. Aus Umweltgründen sind die dadurch verkleinerten Verpackungen zwar sicher ein Vorteil. Und viele Nutzer besitzen schon genug Ladegeräte, aber eben nicht jeder. Aber es gibt auch viele sehr günstige 18W oder 20W-USB C-Netzteile, die zumindest fast genauso schnell laden, wie das Original.-iPhone-Preise in der EU leider deutlich angestiegenNeutral:-Wohl kaum Verbesserung der Tele-Kamera, immer noch nicht mehr als 3x „Zoom“ bzw. mehr Tele-Brennweite. Die Konkurrenz bietet da teilweise deutlich mehr… Nur bei wenig Licht soll sich die Qualität verbessert haben, vermutlich aber nur per Software.-Lightning-Stecker: Ich finde den Lightning-Stecker der iPhones immer noch technisch sehr gut -die Kabel halten sehr gut und der Stecker ist ziemlich robust. Auch mehrfache Abstürze bei einigen iPhones direkt auf den Stecker haben bisher bei mir keinen Schaden verursacht. USB C scheint mir da etwas anfälliger und die Stecker brauchen auch ein wenig mehr Platz.Andererseits gibt es für USB C eben viel mehr Zubehör wie Docks und Adapter -da ist die Auswahl für Lightning leider begrenzter. Aber am Smartphone finde ich das nicht so wichtig, beim iPad finde ich USB C wichtiger. Adapter auf USB und SD-Kartenleser gibt es ja u.a. für Lightning auch.Fazit:Meiner Meinung nach ist das iPhone 14 Pro Max derzeit auf jeden Fall das technisch fortschrittlichste Smartphone am Markt. Die Max-Variante hat inzwischen wohl keine technischen Vorteile mehr zum normalen Pro, außer eben neben Display einem größeren Akku.Für Fotografen und Videofilmer sehe ich das iPhone 14 Pro (Max) jedenfalls als ideale Wahl. Die Videoqualität finde ich toll und für viele Foto-Aufgaben ist es schon komplett ausreichend, wenn auch weiterhin kein Smartphone Vollformat-DSLR/DSLM-Kameras ersetzen kann.Für Nutzer älterer Modelle: Wer noch ein iPhone 12 Pro (Max) nutzt, der wird vor allem deutliche Kamera-Fortschritte sicher zu schätzen wissen, vom 13 Pro(Max) sollte der Unterschied nicht besonders groß sein.Rein die Geschwindigkeit bei der Nutzung hat sich nach meinem Eindruck die letzten Jahre nur leicht verbessert und auch ein 11 Pro oder 12 Pro (Max) können bei den meisten Alltagsaufgaben sehr gut mithalten, selbst ein XS Max finde ich noch schnell genug - auch für etwas anspruchsvollere Nutzer.

Dieses Gerät stellt zwar nur ein minimales, aber solides Upgrade zum Vorgänger dar.Das Display ist knackig scharf und butterweich dank 120 Hz Bildwiederholrate. Der Sound ist super und auch beim Empfang 4G/5G, sowie Telefonie gibt es keine Beschwerden.Die Dynamic Island ist ein nettes Gimmick und wird hoffentlich noch mehr Anwendung finden als bisher.Ein Aufrüsten des Speichers ist nicht möglich, daher sollte vor dem Kauf abgewogen werden, was man braucht bzw. künftig brauchen wird.Mit 1 TB ist man aber immer gut bedient, da 4K Videos und RAW Fotodateien sehr viel Platz brauchen.Der Ultrawide Sensor ist noch immer nicht mit einer optischen Bildstabilisierung ausgestattet…das ist nicht gut, aber verschmerzbar. Der Unterschied der Kamera zum 13 Pro Max ist kaum vorhanden. Wer aber von einem 12er oder älter kommt, wird das Upgrade merken.Noch immer gibt es nur 6GB RAM. Hier wären 8GB mal überfällig.Jedoch weiß das neue Schwarz als Farbe sehr zu gefallen und passt ausnahmslos zu jeder Hülle.Auch hier klare Kaufempfehlung für Leute mit dem nötigen Kleingeld ;-)Auch muss Amazon lobend erwähnt werden, denn ich hatte das Gerät zunächst bei Apple selbst bestellt. Nach wochenlangem Warten stellte sich am Tag wo es ausgeliefert werden sollte und die Tage danach heraus, dass ein UPS Mitarbeiter wohl mehr Lust auf das Gerät und es einfach behalten hatte, obwohl ich es bezahlte…was in einem wochenlangen Hin und Her mündete. ABER bei Amazon lief alles reibungslos und unkompliziert ab. Hier wurde das Gerät sehr schnell und zufriedenstellend geliefert! Dafür nochmals vielen Dank, dass das hier alles SUPER läuft!!!!

Une nouvelle fois, c’est du grand Apple.Pas déçu de mon achat, c’est un achat plaisir que j’ai effectué, mais reste quelques détails à amélioré pour qu’il puisse être parfait.Ayant possédé l’iPhone 12, avant de passer vers l’iPhone 14 Pro Max, la différence se voit tout de suite au niveau de la taille de l’écran et surtout des 3 focus de l’appareil photo, c’est extra la plage d’effet et de filtre que propose l’application « appareil photo ».Côté design, c’est du grand classique étant une grande fan de la marque, c’est un design cylindrique et cette finition propre à la marque quand retrouvé depuis l’iPhone 4 et 4s.La grande nouveauté de cette iPhone 14 Pro Max c’est le Dynamic Island, qui est top, il permet l’affichage simple et intelligent des notifications sur le téléphone (notamment quand en reçoit des appels, messages etc).Pour moi, les futurs axes d’améliorations qu’Apple devrait prévoir sur les nouveaux modèles, c’est de voir le positionnement des objectifs de l’appareil photo qui pour moi commence à devenir redondant et du déjà vu, de plus je remarque que la qualité de l’appareil photo selfie n’est pas vraiment top.Le détecteur de réduction de bruit, n’est pas vraiment vraiment efficace dans des lieux très fréquentés (par ex : rue commerçantes, centre commercial etc). Il faut parfois faire répéter son interlocuteur pour entendre ce qu’il nous dit.Je trouve aussi qu’Apple devrait commencer à réfléchir à alléger l’iPhone tout en proposant un téléphone résistant et de qualité.En conclusion, je recommande cette iPhone, vous ne serez pas déçu, il est simple d’utilisation, agréable à utiliser au quotidien c’est du grand Apple comme d’habitude.

 Ich beziehe mich hier auf meine iPhone 13 Pro Max Bewertung (https://www.amazon.de/gp/customer-reviews/RJSH8YJZQ0YPD) bzw. allgemein ein Vergleich zum Vorgänger.Zum Vorgänger hat sich ""theoretisch"" etwas getan, aber merkt man davon etwas im Alltag!? Ich bin mit meinem 13 Pro Max sehr zufrieden gewesen, daher wird es das 14er schwer haben dieses noch zu ""überbieten"" und am Ende gibt es doch wieder eine ""Verschlechterung"" bei der Kamera.⚪ Gleich geblieben ⚪o Wunderschönes Design (natürlich wieder Geschmackssache), aber die Hochglanzränder sind weiterhin extreme Fingerabdruckmagnete, obwohl sie nun dunkler sindo Qualitativ sehr gut verarbeitet (Optik und Spaltmaße), aber sehr schwer im Gegensatz zur Konkurrenz und die Materialien erwecken einen sehr anfälligen Eindruck, so dass das Handy bei mir sofort in einer Hülle mit Panzerglas (beides von Spigen) gelandet ist - sehr schade, da man nun nichts vom schönen Design siehto Lightning auf USB-C Kabel dabei und immer noch kein USB-C am Geräto Display und Farbwiedergabe wieder mal sehr gut (kein Gelbstich oder ähnliches)o Der Bug, dass bei einer Displayhelligkeit von NULL schwarze Pixel nicht schwarz, sondern grau anzeigt wurden, ist zum Glück weiterhin behobeno Weiterhin sehr gute, wenn nicht sogar die besten, Lautsprecher (in dieser Größe) was Lautstärke und Qualität betrifft!o Das 13 Pro Max hatte eine sehr gute Akkulaufzeit und das 14 Pro Max ""kann"" hier auch mithalten. Warum kann? Je nach aktiviertem Feature, wie z.B. Always-On-Display, hält das 14 Pro Max dann verständlicherweise etwas kürzer durch. Aber wie immer muss man dem iPhone ein paar Tage geben bis es sich ""einpendelt"".✔️ Positives und Negatives zur Kamera ❌+ Allgemein ist die Kamera wieder etwas besser geworden. Warum etwas? Da sie sowieso schon auf einem sehr hohen Niveau ist. Jetzt, je nach Modus, mit 48 MP statt 12 MP. Merkt man die im Alltag? Nicht wirklich!+ Die Makrofunktion wurde nochmal etwas verbessert, ABER ...- ... aktiviert sich aber für meinen Geschmack manchmal schon zu früh+ Videos und Fotos in dunkler Umgebung sehen jetzt nochmal besser aus und ...+ ... der Portraitmodus ist in dunklen Lichtverhältnissen mit dem Tele‑Objektiv (3x und auch 2x) wieder besser geworden (war beim 13er schlechter als beim 12er und machte unscharfe Fotos, wenn von Hand geschossen wurde)-- Was gefühlt schlimmer geworden ist, ist die Objektivverzerrung. Gerade in Aufnahmen auf ""kurze"" Distanz (2-3m), also bei Gruppen oder Personenaufnahmen, verzerren Gesichter deutlich schneller.✔️ Positives und Negatives zum Display+ Dynamic Island statt der Notch. Ich mag die Veränderung und war für mich mit einer der Gründe umzusteigen. Was mir gefällt ist, dass man viele Funktionen mit einem Blick sieht (wie Timer, Musik, etc. pp.), ...- ... allerdings stört es in diversen Apps etwas mehr, da es nun noch weiter ins Bild ragt als die Notch (für mich überwiegt aber der Vorteil)+ nochmal heller als der Vorgänger, was die Benutzung in praller Sonne angenehmer macht+ ProMotion: sieht irgendwie nochmal flüssiger aus oder aktiviert sich schneller bzw. geschmeidiger als beim 13er+ Always-On-Display gefällt mir zwar sehr gut, aber habe ich aufgrund der Akkulaufzeit deaktiviert. Mir wäre eine Status LED (in diversen Farben je nach App) immer noch lieber* * * Fazit * * *Im Grunde hat sich nicht so viel getan zum 13er Pro Max, welches für mich weiterhin das Beste iPhone ist! Lohnt sich also ein Upgrade? Nein, dann würde ich das Geld lieber sparen und eventuell auf das 15er warten. Die einzigen Features die im Alltag auffallen und sinnvoll sein könnten ist die Dynamic Island und das Always-On-Display. Die Kamera macht keine deutlich besseren Fotos als der Vorgänger, so dass sich hier ein Upgrade lohnen würde. Mir viel hier sogar die Objektivverzerrung viel extremer bzw. negativer auf, als bei den anderen beiden Vorgängern. Man hat das Gefühl, dass das Kamerasystem mehr auf Landschaftsfotografie ausgelegt worden ist, als auf ""normale"" bzw.

Ich nutze ein iPhone seit dem ersten iPhone überhaupt, mit wenigen Ausnahmen hatte ich alle Modelle.Nebenher aber auch immer Android Geräte, aktuell das Galaxy S21 Ultra und Note 20 Ultra, sowie das Z-Fold 4. Dabei geht es mir fast immer nur um die Kamera. Voreingenommen, oder Markengebunden bin also ich keinesfalls.Nun zum aktuellen iPhone 14 Pro Max.Zuvor hatte bzw. habe ich immer noch, dass iPhone 12 Pro Max, das 13 Pro Max habe ich übersprungen.Das 12 Pro Max wandert nun in die Vitrine.Ich gehe nicht auf alle technischen Einzelheiten ein, denn die dürften bekannt sein.Was ich aber aus persönlicher Erfahrung konstatieren kann ist folgendes:Die Kamera ist der absolute Wahnsinn. Fotografie ist seit Jahrzehnten meine Leidenschaft, daher weiß ich, worauf ich achten muss. In noch keinem anderen Smartphone habe ich eine derart überragende Kamera erleben dürfen. Selbst einige meiner HighEnd Digitalkameras, wie Sony RX100 VII haben da massiver Schwierigkeiten mitzuhalten. Selbst meine Alpha 7 III macht nicht alles besser.Die Abbildungsleistung, die Detailtreue und der ausgewogene Nachtmodus beeindrucken mich tief. Die Makrofunktion ist ausgewogen und sorgt für viel Spaß. Der Pro RAW Modus ist genial gelöst, macht er die Qualität nochmals besser und erlaub es dem Fotografen alle Eingriffe professionell vorzunehmen.Damit kann man gestalten und im Nachhinein die Situation retten, wenn es einmal schnell gehen musste.Der Telebereich wurde leicht angehoben und erfüllt die meisten Ansprüche. Selbst höhere Zoombereiche sind machbar, auch wenn die dann digital aufbereitet werden, sind sie doch imponierend gut.Benötigt man mehr Tele, wie ich das oftmals brauche, muss man jedoch zu anderen Phones greifen. Daher nutze ich nebenher das Samsung S21 Ultra und sobald es vorgestellt wird, werde ich das S23 Ultra erwerben.Die Kamera des iPhone 14 Pro Max wurde in den letzten Tagen von vielen namhaften und anerkannt seriösen Profifotografen weltweit mit viel lob, regelrecht überhäuft. Zu Recht, wie ich es selbst erleben darf. Sie überzeugt auf allen Ebenen und das nachhaltig und beeindruckend.Der Akku begeistert nach wie vor. 2-3 Tage, bei meinem Nutzungsverhalten sind kein Problem.Das iPhone 14 Pro Max ist ansonsten ein Feinschliff auf allen Ebenen. Sei es die hervorragende Konsistenz des iOS in Bezug auf die Hardware. Oder die geniale Integration der Notch in die Dynamic Island. Eine Lösung, die elegant und intelligent zugleich ist.Genau das macht Apple aus. feinschliff, statt dieses Hecheln nach den Superlativen. Immer ruhig, aber stringent alles verbessern, unaufgeregt.Natürlich das iPhone schwer, natürlich ist die Kamera groß. Wie soll das auch anders sein, wenn man diese Leistung fordert und dann schlussendlich auch bekommt. Wer das nicht möchte, der muss sich ein kleineres Modell kaufen. Wer seine Präferenzen woanders sieht, für den gibt es genug Auswahl.Doch mit einem iPhone, wie dem 14 Pro Max, bekommt man das derzeit beste Gesamtpaket aus Software, Hardware und Leistungsfähigkeit. Ein Gerät das 5-7 Jahre mit Updates unterstützt wird, jedes Jahr, zeitgleich, weltweit.Kritisieren könnte man den immer noch vorhandenen Lightning Anschluss, doch das wäre Jammern auf hohem Niveau.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  Ich bin jedenfalls rundherum zufrieden und kann hier eine glasklare Kaufempfehlung und aussprechen und 5 Sterne vergeben.

Et bien… il s’agit bien du téléphone conformément à l’annonce.Pour ce qui est du produit en lui même il s’agit d’un bon produit, ou l’on paye le prix et où l’on ressent enfin une montée de gamme ainsi que de la nouveauté !Pour ce qui est de amazon, livraison prévue dans 5 jours, livré plus tôt que prévue, le lendemain.Rien à dire, si vous le souhaitez, si vous hésitez, prenez le, vous ne le regretterez pas.

Upgrading from IPhone 13 Pro Max , the differences are few, considering the dynamic island to be the biggest one.  Overall the quality of the phone is top notch , as usually. There is also an improvement at the cameras , which is even better.In conclusion, if you are already at the Apple ecosystem this device will not disappoints you.As if it's worth upgrading from 13 Pro Max , this is something that I cannot say it for sure  , depends on how often you are used to change devices.

Alors déja je tien à souligner sois la chance, sois l’effort d’Amazon d’avoir fais l’effort que je le reçois avant Noël ( date initiale 9 Janvier) donc malgré tout ils ont assurés. Ensuite concernant l’iphone pour ma part je passe d’un Iphone 12 pro max a un iphone 14 pro max, j’ai tout de suite remarqué l’écran. La rapidité et la force du GPU cet iphone est magnifique. L’a couleur Violet intense parcontre est belle mais a mon gout tire un peu vers le noir faut bien regarder pour voir la différence un peu déçue par rapport a cela car au final j’aurais pu l’avoir plutôt encore car je voulais absolument la couleur violet intense, sinon RAS tout est niquel.

3471,B0BDHTRL5X,5,"
Dieses Modell ist viel erfolgreicher als das vorherige, da das iPhone 13 Pro Max die Kamera nicht gut fokussieren konnte.  Ich möchte erwähnen, dass der Preis etwas hoch ist, da die Änderungen des neuen Modells nicht groß sind
"
3472,B0BDHTRL5X,5,"
Das beste iPhone was ich bisher mein Eigen nennen durfte. Die Ergebnisse der Kamera sind nahezu auf Profi Niveau, das 120Hz OLED Display macht einfach Spaß. Der Sprung vom 11er aufs 14er war sehr lohnenswert. Auch die Dynamic Island ist eine tolle Neuerung und jedes mal aufs Neue ein Hingucker. Einzig der Preis ist Apple typisch völlig überzogen, aber mir ist es das Wert. Empfehlung meinerseits!

zu meinem iPhone 12 Pro Max. Die Specs brauche ich nicht anzuführen die gibt es bei Apple umfassend. Zum Telefon, ich habe den Eindruck das Display ist heller schärfer und reagiert schneller. Die Verbindungen sind stabil und gut, Air sowie Wifi. Da ich nur eine Hand, die linke habe ist es für mich wichtig das iPhone einhändig bedienen zu können, und meine Hand ist keine ""Bratpfanne"", dies funkioniert wegen der schnellen und genauen Funktion des Displays sehr gut Nun aber zum Zuckerstück des iPone 14 Pro Max die Kamera. Da muss ich sagen, sehr gut, die farbtreue, die tiefenschärfe, ein gut und schnell laufender Zoom ein guter HDR Modus. Mit dem entsprechenden Bildbearbeitungsprogramm lassen sich mit den Bilder hervorragende Bilder erzeugen. Fazit, ich bin zufrieden und mehr will ich nicht.

Wer ein IPhone 13 Pro hat, für den rechnet sich das Upgrade nicht. Bei der 128GB Variante ist der ProRes Modus nur für 1080P / 30 fps freigeschaltet, also wer mit 4K mit ProRes filmen möchte muss noch tiefer in die Tasche greifen und eine Variante mit mehr Speicher kaufen. Ansonsten macht das Handy aber echt Spaß, besonders die „Dynamic Island“ gefällt mir. Es ist einfach mal was neues fürs Auge und eine kleine Spielerei. Der Akku ist wirklich ein Monster und hält zumindest bei mir locker 2 Tage trotz relativ intensiver Benutzung. Insgesamt macht das Handy einen sehr Qualitativ hochwertigen Eindruck, liegt schön in der Hand und die Performance ist auch beeindruckend.

Ob 1449€ für das Pro Max preislich in Ordnung  ist,  das entscheidet jeder für sich . Wer es unbedingt haben will bestellt es jetzt . Lieferzeit ist sehr lang aber dafür kann Amazon ja nix und es ist ja auch bekannt warum es so ist .

Switched from Samsung S21 Plus, and I went into it not expecting to like it that much, I just heard social media apps are better optimized for IOS and since I need them for my work I decided to go for it.I was pleasantly surprised! Apps really do work so much better, and the user experience is more smooth overall. The only complaint I have is that the numbers aren’t on the main keyboard and I want the option to add them there, and it feels a little bit slow in comparison to Samsung, as if all the animations are weighing the phone down.Other than that, I’m loving the change!

Ich hatte bisher ein iPhone 11 Pro benutzt und wollte unbedingt auf Max umsteigen. Daher habe ich mir das iPhone 14 Pro Max zugelegt. Das iPhone 14 Pro Max hat mich bis jetzt positiv beeindruckt.Der Unterschied zu meinem alten iPhone ist enorm. Das iPhone 14 Pro Max ist flüssiger, leistungsstarker und und schneller. Über die Kamera muss ich echt nicht viel schreiben. Sie ist faszinierend. Die Bildauflösung ist sehr hoch. Dadurch steigt auch die Qualität der Fotos, die man macht. Die Farbe Dunkellila hat mich begeistert. Sie lässt das iPhone edel wirken und ist zudem eine ziemlich extravagante Farbe. Im Großen und Ganzen kann ich berichten, dass ich mit den iPhone sehr zufrieden bin. Einen Stern ziehe ich wegen dem hohen Preis ab und dass es zu dem Preis keinen Adapter zum Laden dazu gibt.

I upgraded to the iPhone 14 Pro Max from an iPhone XS.So far the battery life is exactly what apple has promised. I am a rather light user. I typically browse the news when I’m traveling to work, perhaps listen to some music for my hour long commute. Same commute back home. And I still have more than 50% battery life!Such a huge improvement from my iPhone XS which could hardly make it through to evening.I like that the camera has now a wide angle lens, a 3 times zoom telephoto lens and something called cinematic mode which I still have to try out.All in all, I am very much impressed and happy that I bought this phone.

Ich benutze seit 2013 hauptsächlich iPhones, mit 2 Android Handys, die als Zweitgerät benutzt wurden/werden. Mein Handy davor war ein 12 Pro Max welches ich geliebt habe. Wie immer fing mein 12PM an zu spinnen, sobald neuere Modelle erschienen. Das war zur Zeit der 13er Serie so (bei der waren die Neuigkeiten nicht einen Wechsel Wert), dasselbe passierte auch mit der 14er Serie, bei der musste aber nun ein neues Handy her.Ja die Dynamic Island sieht toll aus und wird, sobald sich mehrere Apps angepasst haben, sogar etwas besseres; Ja der Kinomodus ist toll, man kann aus allem ein Meisterstück kreieren; Und ja, das Akku hält etwas besser als mein 12PM (mit nur 82% Akkukapazität), aber hier hört es auch schon auf.Wenn ich die Möglichkeit hätte, würde ich das Gerät zurücksenden, ich bin kurz davor direkt zu Apple zu rennen aber gedulde mich noch.Die Kamera war (und teilweise ist immer noch) eine Katastrophe.Zu Beginn dauerte es bis zu 11 Sekunden, bis die Kamera reagierte (also konnte man spontane Fotoaufnahmen vergessen), da meine Geduld zu dem Zeitpunkt schon am Ende war, weiß ich nicht wie lange es tatsächlich maximal bräuchte. Also musste ich stets die Kamera App aus dem Hintergrund entfernen (schließen) und neustarten. Es passierte also nicht nur in den Apps von Drittanbietern.Normale Videos sind furchtbar, man sieht den Übergang zum Makromodus, da kann ich mittlerweile fast keine Videos mehr aufnehmen, ohne Brüche in der Aufnahme festzustellen. Da ich Produktaufnahmen, Social Media Content und weiteres aufnehme, ist dies für mich ein No-No-No!Viele Apps stürzen auch nach mehreren Updates ab, sollte sich zwar bald beruhigen sobald es wieder ein Update gibt oder die App Hersteller an der Kompatibilität geschraubt haben, nervt aber trotzdem.Ich weiß, dass viele von diesen (und dutzenden weiteren) Problemen durch diverse Updates beseitigt werden (können) aber ehrlich gesagt finde ich die Preise in Deutschland eh eine Frechheit, dann auch noch ein Gerät zu erhalten, welches noch nicht ausgereift ist, finde ich absurd.Ich habe das 512GB Modell nur ausgewählt weil es das einzige schnell lieferbare war, musste also nochmal tiefer in die Geldtasche greifen aber bin sehr enttäuscht. Mein nächstes Handy wird kein iPhone sein, das steht schon mal fest.

Sehr zufrieden!Mega schnelle Leistung. Always-on-display ist für mich sehr von Vorteil (obwohl der Akku vielleicht deswegen ein bisschen leidet), da ich nicht immer den Bildschirm anfassen muss, um zu sehen was für eine Mitteilung ich bekommen habe, oder wie spät es ist. Face-ID im Landscape-Modus. Tolle Kameras (besonders mit 48 MP in RAW Format). Heller Bildschirm für draußen in der Sonne. Sehr gute Lautsprecher und sogar ist die ""Dynamic Island"" besser und schöner als gedacht.

 The first time I used an iPhone … I found it a wonderful device, excellent features that suit me very much, but I have a small remark. I hope Apple will listen to me. My problem is I wish them to make a phone with a stylus, as Samsung does, because this helps me a lot in my work.  Thank you and I wish you further progress

Ich ersetze mit dem iPhone 14 Pro Max mein mittlerweile vier Jahre altes Xs Max, da ich nicht zu den Menschen gehöre, die jedes Jahr das neueste Modell besitzen müssen. Und das Upgrade ist in dem Fall schon deutlich. Es ist extrem schnell, das Display ist äußerst hell und scharf und die Kamera macht wirklich brillante Bilder. Zudem bin ich mit 5G nun auch auf dem aktuellen Stand. Always-On benötige und nutze ich nicht. Was mir nicht so gefällt ist der Kamerabuckel, welcher beim Xs Max deutlich dezenter ausfällt. Auch der Preis ist mittlerweile recht schmerzhaft. Wenn es sich aber genau so wacker schlägt wie mein Xs Max, dann kann man das wohl noch verkraften. Amazon und DPD haben übrigens verlässlich und pünktlich geliefert.

I like the build quality of Apple products, and the iPhone 14 Plus makes no exception. The cameras are amazing, especially if you use them with a third party app. It is not much more to say about this phone, it does what it should do and it is very reliable. The only minus point is that in 2022 we still have the old lighting port instead of the much faster usb c.

Die technischen Sprünge zwischen den iPhone-Generationen sind nicht mehr so groß wie in früheren Jahren, jedoch kommen gleichwohl jedes Jahr neue sinnvolle Verbesserungen hinzu.USB-C wäre sicherlich auch schon für das 14er wünschenswert gewesen, aber das ist sicherlich klagen auf hohem Niveau.Kritiker die einen Mangel an Neuerungen ausgemacht haben, müssen die aktuelle Generation ja nicht kaufen. Für alle anderen ist es ein super Smartphone, welches einen gut durch den Tag bringt und tolle Fotos schießt.

Zum Vergleich habe ich mein iPhone 11 Pro Max.Schnelligkeit, Qualität der Fotos, die neue Dynamic Island und die neuen Lautsprecher sind toll geworden.

Habe seit dem iphone 3GS iphones und mein letzter Wechsel war nun vom 11 pro zum 14 pro max. Grundsätzlich wie üblich ein gutes Gerät. Nur die Neuerungen auch bei einem größeren Sprung (11 pro auf 14 pro max) sind zu vernachlässigen. Es gibt eigentlich in meinen Augen nur noch wenige Features die für ein ""Must-have"" taugen. Das Hauptaugenmerk auf die Kamera finde ich auch nicht so toll (vielleicht für Spezialisten unabdingbar) - auch mein 11 pro hat schon super Fotos gemacht. Dynamic Island - nett, aber auch nicht mehr. Satelliten-Notruf - steht im wahrsten Sinn des Wortes in den Sternen, wann dieses Feature für Europa aktiviert wird. Hauptsächliche Gründe für den Wechsel bei mir waren: besseres Display (ja das ist durchaus merklich) und die bessere Akkulaufzeit. Der Wow-Effekt ist aber bei diesem Wechsel ausgeblieben.

Hab jetzt immer ein Jahr ausgesetzt und zuvor das iPhone 12 Pro Max gehabt jetzt das iPhone 14 Pro Max, werde es zurück schicken. Keins der ,,neuen,, Merkmale rechtfertigt den Preis und ich bin wirklich ein Apple jünger. Also gehts zurück, wenn ihr nen 13 pro habt mach das Upgrade noch weniger Sinn. Leider ist der Wert Verfall durch die Marktsättigung inzwischen auch zu spüren. Also lieber iPhone 13 Pro und warten oder in den saueren Apfel beißen.

Beim Transfer der Daten stürzte das Teil ab und der Bildschirm blieb schwarz. Reset. Nochmal.Endlich läuft es.Die Farben des Bildschirms sind übersättigt, soll wohl dadurch ""hochwertiger"" wirken. Die Kamerasensoren auf der Rückseite sind riesengroß, wie bei einem Chinahandy.Apropos China:Bei der Bedienung kommt plötzlich nervige Werbung. Apple braucht mehr Geld: Für ""Apple Arcade"" und irgendwelchen anderen Konsumkram. Alles im Abo natürlich.Apps gibts nur im Store. Manuelle Installation? Fehlanzeige.Netzteil? Muss man extra kaufen. Klimaschutz. Na klar. Als ob das bei nem 1500 Euro Smartphone noch ne Rolle spielen würde.Keine Ahnung wie man als Marktführer mit so nem lausigen Produkt kommen kann.

Wozu eigentlich soviel Geld ausgeben, wenn die 13 Pro Max bessere Bilder macht als die 14 Pro Max?Sorry aber für dieses Geld kaufe ich kein neues Handy und geht zurück. Ich warte mal auf die 15 ab.

I bought this phone for the camera, thinking the gold might be a big garish (but was all that was in stock). The camera is ok (somewhat better than the 11 I upgraded from, but not hugely so). What I found:Camera isn't fantastic, it's a incremental upgrade. It's ok.Screen is utterly superb, bright and fantastic, especially if you're coming from an earlier phone (pre 13).Finish is lovely, metal around edge is more silver than gold, rear is subtle and not garish at all. It's beautiful.Phone is fast and feels premium.I love this phone, but not for the reasons I thought I would. It doesn't disappoint at all.

It’s my first time using an iPhone. I have two iPads and they’re good, so I thought of getting an iPhone as well. I love the cameras, I love taking photos with this iPhone, I feel like I’m a professional photographer. This phone really amazes me. I took a lot of amazing pics for my family, everyone loves the pics taken by this phone. Even the ones who was toi shy to take pics love to have pics taken with this phone now. Because they look the same as in real in the pics taken by this phone. This is my favourite phone so far. I wish I got the Max one though. My next iPhone will definitely be a Max. I have used it for over a month now, still so happy having it.

From the new upgraded 48MP main camera, to the new ""Dynamic Island"" this phone gets it right. I find the new dynamic island to be quite innovative and it certainly has lots of potential. It's crazy how fluid everything is with iOS 16 and the promotion display.The cameras are huge. The camera quality is great, shooting raw at 48MP does take a lot of space ~80MB per picture but the detail is insane. They've greatly improved the photo quality in the dark. One thing that I really like about iPhones is how quick they can take and process pictures after you press the button. They've also improved the front cameras significantly compared to last year everything looks more crisp.Battery life is really good as well, I'm not so sure as of yet how much the always on display is affecting battery life so far but I've turned mine off.Overall I love this phone!

Bought as a replacement for an iphone 8 that had seen better days. Is this an amazing upgrade after several evolutions, eh well no!It has a slightly bigger screen, can’t say i’ve noticed any improvement in the resolution. Likewise for the camera. Main difference is the fingerprint scan has now become facial recognition and the display is on all the time, woohoo! All in all it’s just a phone. I needed a new one but i think £1429 is a bit much as it doesn’t really do anything that my previous five year old iPhone didn’t do. I can’t believe some people have upgraded from a 13 pro and think this is amazing, i’ll just conclude i get out more than them.

Awesome photos and screen. But…It’s essentially a 13 pro with a better camera, and you’ll need a new phone case too because the camera lenses are larger. Oh I think it makes calls too?

Upgraded from the 11 to 14 Pro mainly for the 48MP main camera and island. two standout features of the phone that enhance music listening and photos to a different level. Battery remains suspect but hopefully apple rectify this in future IOS updates. Depth and detail of photos make this a well worthy investment.
"
3585,B0BDJ279KF,5,"
Fantastic product. Space black gives a elegant look for the device and dynamic island is very practical and useful. I think comparing iPhone 13 pro dynamic island gives a fresh look for the display and it's gives you different experience that never before an iPhone model

If you own an iPhone 13 Pro Max the 14 pro max will feel and look almost identical. Main difference being improved camera hardware , the dynamic island instead of the notch and a more powerful chipset and the brightest screen on any mobile out right now. For me I didn’t notice any improvement on speed however over the 13 pro max. Cases for the 13 pro max won’t fit due to the bigger camera bump. Personally I don’t think it’s worth the upgrade from 13 pro max, however if you are coming from the 12 or below it’s definitely a great update. In a nutshell the 14 pro max shares 95 percent of the 13 pro maxs dna.

1. So glad Apple did something about the notch - I love the new dynamic Island.2. Very happy with the Pro, the pro max seemed too bulky and heavy.3. Smooth and easy to use and setup4. The camera is bigger and better I find the battery to be adequate and I’m a heavy user.Overall very happy!

I traded in my iPhone 13 Pro for the 14 Pro and I would like to provide a full verdict as usual and a detailed review so that interested people would get an idea about the device and whether they should get it or skip it.- Design:This iPhone still maintains, more or less, the same shape and form of the 13 Pro, with a major and a minor difference. The major difference is the newly designed notch. Some people would call it dynamic island, but it is a notch regardless of the sugar coated names. The minor difference is that the camera bumps is getting bigger, still manageable though as long as you have a case on.- Specs and line-up:This is the first time Apple opts for what I believe to be a two-phone line-up. The difference between the 14 Pro and standard 14 is too huge that I would rather rename the 14 phone to something else. This is probably the first time I see the same phone line-up having two processing chips. So at this stage of the review I would advise you to not even consider getting the 14 model, it's just a rebranded iPhone 13 and you will be disappointed, especially that the chip is the same from last year.The 14 Pro though provides a decent, albeit shy, leap in terms of specs: Always on display that takes advantage of the refresh rate (I will explain later in this review), a dynamic notch in terms of interaction, finally a 48mp main camera with amazing performance as usual, A16 chip, A slightly improved battery life in terms of numbers (longevity is not necessarily better than the 13 Pro), and an improved selfie camera that packs autofocus functionality.The 14 Pro is slightly heavier than the 13 Pro but that's negligible (Like 3 grams).- Speed and Responsiveness:Prior to handing my 1 year old 13 Pro for trade in, it was performing as fast as when I first got it. I never experienced a lag and moving between apps was very smooth with almost non-existent app loading time. Upon unpacking this iPhone 14 Pro, the experience was similar if not better, but any differences in terms of speed are literally negligible, as that will be a matter of milliseconds.- Battery life and Charging:Nothing different. Apple's fast charging technology is still the same, with a promise of 50% in 30 minutes. This is lower than competitors but as I stated in my iPhone 13 Pro review last year, this is done to maintain the battery health and not cause a lot of heating during charging. Also, battery life is the best in the iPhone line-up compared to other flagships, so you would go throughout the day with no issue, sometimes with 50% left at the end of the day.Just another point of reassurance, at the time of upgrade, my one year old iPhone 13 Pro had 94% battery health, and a single charge was still giving me 7 hours of screen on time easily.The 14 Pro doesn't improve much compared to the 13 Pro. So far I don't see any huge difference in terms of battery longevity.- Camera Quality and Modes:As a semi-professional photographer, the improved camera was probably the main reason for my upgrade. I just like to have the best smartphone camera possible, and having a 48mp redesigned lens with bigger sensor is definitely a huge leap from a photographer's perspective. But from a casual consumer's perspective, is this a huge difference. Well, your iPhone 13 Pro produces amazing photos, and in all honesty the 14 Pro improves that, but not to the point where I would say this is a huge improvement. I would suggest checking camera comparisons for both smartphones before upgrading.Modes are almost the same, with the addition of Action mode in the 14 Pro, an improved night mode, and a cinematic mode that goes up to 4K (Locked at 1080p for the 13 Pro).- Software:iOS 16 just landed on the 13 Pro and is the same software on the 14 Pro. It introduces several good additions and fixes some issues from the past.- Dynamic Island:Honestly, the name is just funny. Practically, it's definitely a very clever way to live with the notch. Apple is the first company that simply used the notch in its favour, and they should get credit for that. The notch is still a notch, an annoying part of the display that just makes it less appealing, but the dynamic island makes it more useful. Don't be fooled though, the notch is not touch-responsive! It's the edges of the notch and the middle that are. Apple managed to make the notch very visually appealing with several widgets and functionalities that make the notch almost disappear when interacting with the phone, but it's still there.Final Verdict:With the iPhone 14 Pro, stunning things have just been improved a little bit, and that's my summary for this year's flagship. I wouldn't call this a worthy upgrade for most, but each situation requires a specific choice, so lets go through the following questions!1. Shall I get the iPhone 14 (standard model)?In my opinion, NO! It's a rebranded 13 model, so either wait for the 13's price to drop, or skip and get the 15 next year. If you have the iPhone 13, don't even dare to get the 14, you will be disappointed.2. Shall I get the 14 Pro if I have the 13 Pro now?It really depends! So check the scenarios below:Are you fed up with the 13 notch and can't live with it, and you want a newly-designed notch that does some tricks? Are you very enthusiastic when it comes to photography and want a 10/10 camera rather than a 9.5/10 one? Do you have money to spare easily? If you answer yes to these then sure, GO FOR IT.Are you happy with your 13 Pro, you don't mind keeping it for another year, and your battery health is no less than 86% by now? Then please keep your iPhone, it is literally equally amazing, and differences you hope to find aren't very impressive.Do you own the iPhone 12 or lower, skipped the 13 line-up? Then if you are financially comfortable, why not jump to the 14 Pro! The differences you would notice will be massive. Do you want a bargain though? Then why not wait 2 months and the iPhone 13 Pro will be discounted!Are you an Android user? Please think carefully before you jump into the ecosystem. You will find having only an iPhone to be quite limiting and, like me, you will end up getting Air pods, the watch, the MacBook, and probably the iPad. It's so pricey to get the ecosystem, but is it worth it? From my perspective a definite yes!If I think of any other relevant questions, I'll make sure to list them here. Also, if you want a review of the iPhone 13 Pro then you can find that on my profile.

The iPhone 14 Pro is an excellent phone, even if it’s not necessarily a huge upgrade from the iPhone 13 Pro. If you’re coming from an older model – maybe an 11 Pro or one of the non-Pro phones – then the differences can be stark.The Dynamic Island is a silly name but turns an annoying design quirk into something useful, while the cameras are very powerful if pushing them to the limit is of interest. The display remains gorgeous, while the performance boosts might not make themselves known for a few years yet.On a personal level, I would have liked a switch to USB-C over Lightning and a bigger focus on faster charging for quicker top-ups when you’re in a pinch. Other phones, notably the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, remain far more competent at zoom photography, too.It’s not been a standout year for phone upgrades. Samsung did the bare minimum with the S22 series and Android makers have struggled to really push things forward. The iPhone 14 Pro also isn’t a massive leap, yet it packs enough features to make this the best phone you can buy right now.

 Wie toll (aus Apple Fans Sicht) oder auch wie schlecht ein iPhone ist (aus Sicht der Android Fans) lasse ich bewusst komplett außen vor und versuche mich in meiner Rezension auf die Fakten und wirklichen Neuheiten des iPhone 14 Pro zu beschränken.Direkt am Anfang ein wichtiger Hinweis für Leute, welche professionell mit dem iPhone 14 Pro in ProRes 4K Filmen wollen:► ⚠️ ProRes 4K erfordert mind. 256 GB Variante ⚠️Bereits das iPhone 13 Pro und das iPhone 13 Pro Max können Videos im fortschrittlichen ProRes-Format aufnehmen. Allerdings bedarf es für die höchste Auflösung in 4K dann eines Modells mit mindestens 256 GB Speicher oder mehr. Dies ändert sich auch in diesem Jahr nicht, es gilt demnach noch immer dieselbe Beschränkung.„iPhone 14 Pro und iPhone 14 Pro Max unterstützen die ProRes Videoaufnahme in der Kamera App bei 1080p 30 fps bei der 128 GB Speicheroption und bis zu 4K 30 fps bei den 256 GB, 512 GB und 1 TB Speicheroptionen.“Wer also ProRes 4K benötigt muss zwingend zu 256 GB oder mehr greifen.► ⭐️ Dynamic Island: der wirkliche Grund für einen Kauf? ✨Seit Jahren setzen Smartphone-Hersteller auf sogenannte Punchhole-Displays. Nun verbaut auch Apple eines in seinem neuen iPhone 14 Pro. Und zeigt der Branche einmal mehr, wie man Features attraktiver macht.Das Dynamic Island ist eigentlich für mich der Grund gewesen um mir das iPhone 14 Pro überhaupt zu holen.Das Loch wird zu einer ganz neuen Experience umgebaut von Apple und funktioniert folgendermaßen:Unter dem Namen „Dynamic Island"" (etwa: dynamische Insel) hat Apple sein Punchole zur Anzeige-Zentrale umgedacht. Startet man einen Song, lässt einen Timer herunterzählen oder verbindet seine Airpods, erweitert sich das Loch optisch zur Seite und zeigt die Benachrichtigungen dafür innerhalb des nun größeren schwarzen Rahmens an.Das sieht nicht nur cool aus, sondern bietet tatsächlich einen Mehrwert. Tippt man etwa auf die Song-Anzeige, klappt sich die schwarze Fläche der Insel noch weiter aus. Dann erscheinen auch Songtitel, die Option zum weiter- oder zurückskippen sowie ein Schieberegler zum Springen im Lied. Auch ein Unlock von Apps per FaceID, die Anzeige wenn ein Ladegerät angeschlossen wurde und vieles weitere sind nun alles Teil der neuen Anzeige.In Zukunft werden viele bekannte Apps „Dynamic Island“ auch unterstützen und somit nimmt der Mehrwert immer mehr zu.► 📷 Bild- und Videoqualität 📸Natürlich gibt es auch dieses Jahr wieder ein Upgrade für die Kamera. Bis zu 4x höhere Auflösung in ProRAW und ein größerer Sensor als beim iPhone 13 Pro.Durch den neuen A16 Bionic Chip holt natürlich nicht nur die Hardware mehr aus den Bildern raus sondern auch die Software. Man kann beispielsweise mittels TrueDepth mehrere Motive in Fotos und Selfies fokussieren und mittels dem Action Modus benötigt man in unruhigen und dynamischen Aufnahmen kein Gimbal mehr um gute Aufnahmen hinzubekommen.Die Aufnahmen bei  Nacht, ob mit oder ohne Blitz, sind zudem auch deutlich schärfer und besser geworden.Ich könnte jetzt natürlich mit den ganzen technischen Details weiter langweilen aber wer sich dafür ernsthaft interessiert findet diese Details auf der Produktseite von Apple.Hier soll es ausreichen, dass nicht nur die Marketing Abteilung von Apple die neue Kamera lobt sondern auch ich die Verbesserung in der Praxis definitiv bestätigen kann.► 🔌 Akkulaufzeit: macht sich das Always-On Display bemerkbar? 🔌Das Always-On Display kennt man ja schon von der Apple Watch und nun bekommt es das iPhone 14 Pro ebenfalls. Dabei hat Apple wieder jede Menge Softwarelösungen eingebaut um trotzdem Akku zu sparen. So erkennt das iPhone ob es sich in der Hosentasche befindet oder ob man im Raum ist und schaltet wahlweise das Display komplett aus, wenn man sowieso nicht darauf schauen kann.Bei normaler alltäglicher Nutzung hält der Akku bei mir von 6:00 Uhr bis 23:00 Uhr und ich habe Abends noch um die 25% Prozent womit das iPhone dann ans MagSafe Ladekabel wandert.👉 Noch ein kleiner Tipp um die Batteriekapazität möglichst lange zu erhalten☝️Ein Lithium-Ionen-Akku wird am besten zwischen 20-80% geladen. Da das im Alltag aber nicht so einfach umzusetzen, ist gibt es einen einfachen Trick das Gerät nicht auf mehr als 80% aufzuladen.Das Stichwort lautet hier Kurzbefehl-App in Kombination mit einer smarten Steckdose. Die Kurzbefehle App sendet dann ein Signal an die smarte Steckdose, dass diese bei 80% ausschalten soll.Wie das ganze funktioniert hat Nils-Hendrik Welk in einem YouTube Video zusammengefasst und damit ist es möglich die maximale Kapazität von seinem iPhone Akku deutlich länger zu erhalten.Übrigens: Das ganze funktioniert auch mit smarten Steckdosen aus der SmartLife App: Einfach dort unter Szene eine zum Einschalten der Steckdose und eine zum Ausschalten der Steckdose erstellen und dafür einen Kurzbefehl für Siri (unten rechts Hinzufügen zu Siri) und dann in der Kurzbefehle App die Automation wie im Video gezeigt einrichten aber stattdessen den Kurzbefehl für die Steckdose an und den Kurzbefehl für die Steckdose aus einrichten. So spart man sich eine HomeKit kompatible Steckdose falls man aktuell nur SmartLife nutzt►🚦 Vorteile und Nachteile 🚦✅ vielfältige neue Möglichkeiten durch Dynamic Island✅ der deutsche Markt hat weiterhin einen Simkarten Slot (nur der US Markt wurde komplett auf eSim umgestellt)✅ A16 Bionic setzt neue Maßstäbe✅ noch einmal deutlich verbesserte Foto- und Videoaufnahmen✅ neuer Action Modus sorgt auch ohne Gimbal für nahezu verwacklungsfreie Videos✅ Akku hält trotz neuem Always-On Display den ganzen Tag durch✅ CrashDetect Feature erkennt Autounfälle und ruft automatisch Hilfe (gerade für ältere Autos ohne eCall Funktion nützlich)✅ grandioses Display mit bis zu 2000 Nits Helligkeit und somit auch bei direkter Sonneneinstrahlung keine Probleme mehr✅ noch einmal verbesserte Makrofotografie durch einen besseren Näherungssensor❌ immer noch kein USB-C Ladeanschluss (der neue EU Standard müsste Apple so langsam zwingen auf USB-C zu gehen)❌ Kamerasystem ragt sehr weit aus dem Gehäuse und ohne Schutzhülle zerkratzt man die Linsen❌ ProRes 4K nur ab der 256 GB Version verfügbar❌ happige Speicheraufpreise und allgemein durch den schwachen Euro ist dieses Jahr das iPhone noch einmal teurer geworden► 🤔 Für wen lohnt sich das Upgrade? 🫣Pauschal gesagt für alle die kein iPhone 13 Pro/Max  haben und wer ein iPhone 13 Pro/Max hat und das nötige Kleingeld über wird mit dem neuen iPhone 14 Pro definitiv  zufrieden sein.➡️ FazitDas iPhone Pro wird mal wieder ein Verkaufsschlager und die meisten Käufer werden den Aufpreis auf die Pro Version alleine wegen Dynamic Island vornehmen.Das Ultra in Apples Werbetext ist ebenso ein versteckter Hinweis auf die nächsten Jahre. Mit der Apple Watch Ultra hat Apple es vorgemacht und wird zukünftig höchstwahrscheinlich  neben dem normalen iPhone, iPhone Plus,  dem iPhone Pro und Max auch ein iPhone Ultra anbieten mit mehr Features um den Kunden die höchste Version schmackhaft zu machen.Ich persönlich bin mit meinem iPhone 14 Pro sehr zufrieden und die Neuerungen haben mich definitiv überzeugt.Kaufempfehlung? 👍Ich hoffe das ich Ihnen mit meiner Rezension ein wenig behilflich sein konnte. Vielen Dank!

Ich hatte zuvor ein iPhone Xs in silber mit 512GB. Den Luxus vom großen Speicher wollte ich nicht mehr missen. Die ist nun mein drittes iPhone. Ich hatte das 3G, was ich damals nicht mochte und mich zu Android wechseln ließ. Das Xs hat mich bekehrt und nach nun fast 4 Jahren war ich bereit für den Wechsel zum 14 Pro.Display:Das Display ist nochmal deutlich intensiver und heller als mein Voriges. Die 120hz sind spürbar und angenehm flüssig. Aber hier gibt es keinen so großen Sprung. Dennoch ist es qualitativ eines der besten Display am Markt.Die Dynamic Island finde ich sehr clever integriert und nutze sie ausgiebig.Akku:Mein Xs hatte nur noch 80% und dementsprechend ist der Akku eine neue Welt für mich. Das Telefon hält nun wieder den Tag durch und sogar noch mehr. Super! Ich benutze zum Laden MagSafe und das funktioniert hervorragend. Ich habe dazu die schwarze Lederhülle und auch hier funktioniert das Laden problemlos.Leistung:Ganz ehrlich... spüre ich nicht. Manche Apps starten deutlich schneller, ja. Der Rest ist nicht zu merken. Auch der Unterschied von 4G auf 5G ist in meinem Nutzungsprofil kaum der Rede wert. Hier und da öffnen Apps schneller und manche Anwendungen laufen flüssiger.Optik:Ja, Killer-Feature für mich. Das schwarz, diese satinierte Rückseite... Ein Traum! Fässt sich dazu auch noch hervorragend an. Schade das da eine Hülle herum muss. Es ist aber dennoch sehr rutschig und das Telefon sollte man gut in der Hand halten. Die weit rausragenden Kameras sind natürlich heftig und ich hoffe Apple hat hier nun auch sein Limit erreicht.Kamera:Weiteres Feature welches den Wechsel für mich notwendig machte. Da hat sich Einiges getan, gerade bei den Nachtaufnahmen stinkt mein Xs völlig ab. Porträt-Fotos sind nochmal besser ausgearbeitet. Einzig bei Aufnahmen in heller Umgebung sind Unterschiede nur marginal. Die bessere Frontkamera ist ein kleiner Gewinn, wenn man sie für Selfies nutzt.Preis:Ja, da war wirklich der Schock. Ich bin kein Freund von Finanzierungen oder Vertragstelefonen. Deswegen spare ich mir das Geld an und kaufe das Telefon. Bei diesem stolzen Preis tut der Abzug vom Konto aber schon weh. Inflation und Euro-Kurs, okay. Aber preislich ist da für mich eine Grenze erreicht. Klar, ich hätte die Möglichkeit dann irgendwann eben nicht die größte oder zweitgrößte Speicheroption zu wählen.Fazit:Frei von Fanboy-Geschwafel sind die iPhones gute Telefone. Ich bin zufrieden, denn ich wurde bisher nicht enttäuscht. Der Preis schockt aber im Endeffekt hat sich das Telefon gut weiterentwickelt. in 4 Jahren bin ich hoffentlich noch genauso zufrieden.

Was für ein tolles Handy. Bin vom XR umgestiegen. Übertragung aufs neue Handy kein Problem und in 15 Minuten erledigt. Akku hält bei mir 2 Tage im stromsparenden Modus. Regiert schnell und die Bedienung ist einfach. Bereue nicht dass ich es gekauft habe auch wenn der Preis hoch ist. Lieferung innerhalb 3 Tage. Was will man mehr. Apple eben 😍

Das iPhone 14 pro wurde als Nachfolger des ein Jahr alten iPhone 13 Pro Max angeschafft und verrichtet wie erwartet seinen Dienst.Ein iPhone ist schon toll.Mein erstes iPhone war das 8er, dann das 11 pro, 12 pro, 13 pro max und schließlich das 14 pro.Vorher hatte ich zwei Androiden, davor diverse Blackberry.""Geliebt"" habe ich sie alle ... ausgenommen die Androiden, damit bin ich nicht warm geworden, weshalb das iPhone als solches die logische Konsequenz war und bis heute ist.Das nur zur Vorgeschichte.Von den iPhones war natürlich stets das Neuere auch das Bessere, zumindest in einzelnen Punkten.Notwendig wäre keines gewesen! Gut, vielleicht schon das 11pro, weil das nach dem 8er den ganzen Bildschirm ausnutzte.Die Kamera wurde natürlich auch stets ein Quäntchen besser und da man heute die Fotos ja auch nur noch am Handy oder Tablet anschaut, lohnt es auch nicht mehr die qualitativ deutlich hochwertigere DSLR- oder Systemkamera rauszukramen, man nimmt eh das Smartphone zum Fotografieren.Insofern macht man mit dem iPhone nix verkehrt.Vermutlich können ähnlich teure Androiden auch nix anderes, wie halt das iPhone.Die Notch, ob groß oder doch eher klein, oder aktuell das Dynamic Island sind mir Wurscht, sie stören mich nicht. Wer sich daran stört, reibt sich daran auf und muss die Finger generell vom iPhone lassen!Wer mindestens 1300,- € unnötig in der Ecke liegen hat, kann das iPhone 14 pro bedenkenlos kaufen.Wer aber auf sein Geld schauen muss und ein fast aktuelles Pro-Modell (12, 13,) besitzt und mit seinen Fotos grundsätzlich sehr zufrieden ist, sieht aus Vernunftsgründen besser vom Kauf ab und wartet noch ein Jahr.Obwohl ich mich jedes Mal natürlich über mein neues iPhone gefreut habe, war nach der Datenübertragung und dem ersten Einschalten auch stets der erste Gedanke: Toll, es ist wie das Alte und die Kohle ist erst mal weg!Das wirklich einzige Argument für das alljährliche iPhone-Upgrade ist der ""Ich will das haben!""-Gedanke, von einer Notwendigkeit kann sicher nicht die Rede sein.

Nach guten 13 Jahren in der Android-Smartphone-Welt (letztes iPhone war ein 3GS) wurde es infolge jüngster Enttäuschungen mit dem OnePlus 9 Pro (tolle Hardware, weniger optimierte und fehlerbehaftete Software) Zeit für einen zweiten Anlauf.Seinerzeit versuchte man alles um sein iPhone etwas mehr zu personalisieren und die von  Apple vorgegebenen Einschränkungen zu umgehen… einige Jahre später ist man da etwas weniger verspielt und kompromissbereiter.Meine Meinung bisher nach einer knappen Woche Nutzung:(-) Apple hält an vielen Limitierungen fest (bspw. bzgl. des Datenaustauschs via USB/Bluetooth/WiFi-Direct außerhalb des Apple Ökosystems sowie bzgl. diverser Darstellungseinstellungen - Homescreen - kein anpassbarer Raster / alternativer Launcher etc.)(-) Preisgestaltung - die Preise an sich sind schon heftig, die Aufschläge für mehr Speicher, der sich im Nachhinein nicht erweiterten lässt schon frech und dass bspw. die ProRes Funktion erst mit 256 GByte genutzt werden kann man jedoch für die Einstiegsgeräte bei 128 GByte startet grenzt an Hohn.(+) Formfaktor - mit seinen 6,1 Zoll ist das 14 Pro noch gerade so handlich und passt auch deutlich besser in die Hosentasche als bspw. ein 6,7 Zoll Gerät - und das als Flagship-Modell.(+) Software/Nachhaltigkeit - langfristige System-Updates - diesbezüglich ist Apple ungeschlagen - vorbildlich.(+) Akku - trotz der geringeren Kapazität (3.200mAh) ggü. dem OnePlus 9pro (4.500mAh) hält der Akku des iPhone wenigstens genauso gut durch, wenn nicht sogar länger (beide mit aktiviertem Always On Display - variabler Bildwiederholrate bis 120Hz) - hier herrscht tatsächlich der Eindruck vor, dass die neuere Android-Akku-Generation nicht nur super schnell lädt (100% in 30 Minuten - 65 Watt) sondern eben leider auch schneller entlädt. Dieser eklatante Unterschied dürfte dem Umstand geschuldet sein, dass Apple nicht nur den Prozessor selbst entworfen hat, sondern auch minuziös seit Jahren an der Software schraubt und diese auf eine (im Vergleich zur Android-Welt) vergleichsweise überschaubare Anzahl an Geräten optimiert.(+) Bildschirm / Dynamic Island / AlwaysOnDisplay - super Bildschirm - tolle Farben, grandiose Maximalhelligkeit und die Integration der Aussparungen für Frontkamera und Sensoren ist appletypisch toll gemacht. Die Interpretation des AOD ist gut, lässt aber einige Wünsche zu dessen Anpassbarkeit offen - bspw. rein schwarzer Hintergrund unabhängig vom Hintergrundbild / Helligkeitswert verändern / Zeitfenster für aktives AOD etc. .Insgesamt ein wirklich tolles Gerät und für alle die das Geld locker haben empfehlenswert - über die noch immer merklich vorhandenen Einschränkungen ggü. der Android-Welt muss man sich jedoch im Klaren sein.

People have been complaining about the poor battery which indeed maybe an issue but what I did not expect was being let down from the camera and the photos in general. Coming from an iphoneX the 14pro is a lot of hit and miss. It tends to over sharpen the photos and the colors sometimes are way off, reds become grey yellows, bg light becomes overexposed and it crashes colors and details. A lot of times they dont feel natural.
"
3603,B0BDJ279KF,5,"
Also der neue Autofokus ist eine Innovation, die mich geflasht hat. Nie mehr wackelige Videos! Außerdem stört die Helligkeit die neue Leiste oben kaum! Mir gefällt sie persönlich sehr und ich bin mehr als zufrieden mit dem neusten iPhone.

Ich hatte zuletzt ein 11 pro und habe mehr Unterschied bei der Fotoqualität erwartet. Das bekommt Apple irgendwie nicht hin (ist nicht mein einziges Applegerät). Das 14 pro wirkt auch recht klobig, hätte es vom Gefühl her dünner erwartet, aber mit Messschieber gemessen sind es 7,95mm. Laut Apple 7,8mm, also nur marginal.Ich wünsche mir beim nächsten Mal ein dünneres, leichteres Smartphone mit Topkamera ohne rauschen bei dem Preis. Schade, dass es nicht jetzt schon geklappt hat.

Ich bin ein überzeugter Apple iPhone User. Hatte davor das iPhone 13 Pro und bin nun auf das 14 pro umgestiegen.Lohnt sich der Umstieg von 13 pro auf 14 pro? Ich sage hier weder Ja noch nein.Ganz klar es ist ein tolles Gerät mit super Verarbeitungsqualität und netten Features.Aber auch hier merke ich Alltag absolut keine Vorteile des neuen iPhone 14 Pro gegenüber dem 13 Pro.Das always on Display und die notch im Dynamik Island Design sind die neuen Funktionen des iPhone 14 pro. Doch leider muss ich sagen ist Dynamic Island eher nur bei eigenen Apple Apps gewisse Funktionen und Spielereien hat, bei Drittanbieter Apps nicht.Das always on Display regelt auf 10 hz runter und bleibt dabei vollständig beleuchtet. Das finde ich nicht wirklich praktisch gelöst, msn hat immer das Verlangen auf Smartphone zu schauen und denkt man hat wichtige Mitteilungen bekommen.Das hätte man mit schwarzen Display Hintergrund und nur der Anzeige von Uhrzeit und Datum besser machen können. ( so wie Samsung)Ansonsten gibt es nicht viel zu sagen. Es ist trotzdem ein sehr schönes Gerät und macht viel Freude im Alltag.Ob man das Geld ausgeben will für das 14 pro muss jeder selber wissen.Das Kamerasystem arbeitet erstmals mit 48 Megapixeln in RAW Modus. Aber das gilt nur für die Hauptkamera.

Ich bin Umsteiger von Android auf IOS. Das IPhone 14 habe ich erst wenige Wochen; daher kann ich noch nicht allzu viel sagen, aber die hohe Geschwindigkeit der Datenverarbeitung, die tollen Kameras sind schon eine Wucht. Dazu ein sehr ansprechendes Design und eine sehr gute Haptik. Der Akku hält sehr lange.

iPhone 14 Pro découle de plusieurs années de test d’Apple, en passant par le 11, 12, et 13. Cet iPhone représente la fin de ce cycle, le sommet de la montagne, en effet il y met un terme grâce à sa nouvelle encoche/pastille formant une espèce d’île, encoche aux premiers abords très intelligents de la part d’Apple mais qui se relève plutôt être un espèce de d’outil plus esthétique qu’utile.Pleins d’autres nouveautés qui mérite d’être découvert, je recommande très fortement si vous venez du X, XR ou moins, mais cela reste un téléphone peu intéressant pour les possesseurs de 12, 13 qui devraient attendre l’arrivé du 15, qui devrait être le téléphone de la nouvelle ère !

Man muss sich fragen was dieses Smartphone von anderen unterscheidet. Letzter wirklicher Apple-Point ist die Verarbeitung und der Wiederverkaufswert.Leistungstechnisch hebt es sich wenig ab und innovationstechnisch sind weniger WOW-Momente als ich es von früher in Erinnerung hatte. Aufpassen Apple die Konkurrenz ist ganz nahe.

Przesiadłam się po prawie 4 latach z mojego niezawodnego huaweia p30 pro (ten ostatni z googlami).Po tylu latach wydajność pracy poszła zdecydowanie na plus. Jakość aparatu także (chociaż bez bezpośredniego zestawienia zdjęć nie ma aż tylu różnic). Podoba mi się bardzo dynamiczna wyspa mimo, że jest to w większości zasługa animacji. Kolor fioletowy jest cudowny. Taka słodka śliwka węgierka. No po prostu jestem zakochana. Face ID jest przyjemniejszy, bo teraz odczytuje także w poziomie.

Das iPhone 14 Pro 256 GB in silber wurde mir mit zwei Hüllen und 3 Panzergläsern geliefert.Es ist reagiert mega schnell und bearbeitet die Eingabe ohne Verzögerung. Die Kamera schießt sehr scharfe und farbreiche Fotos. Dies ist auf die 48MP Kamera zurückzuführen. Das Display ist sehr hell und gut ablesbar bei direkter Sonneneinstrahlung. Es ist ebenfalls mega schwarz und voller Farben. Der Akku hält bei einem Vielnutzer wie mir einen ganzen Tag. Es gibt nichts zum Meckern. Die Hüllen und das Panzerglas sind ebenfalls von guter Qualität.Ein riesiges Dankeschön geht an M H für das tolle Geschenk! Ich habe mich sehr gefreut!

Einmal iPhone immer iPhone… 2 Versuche hatte ich hinter mir mit Alternativen und bin immer wieder zum Original zurück - dem iPhone! Denn hast du kein iPhone, dann hast du kein iPhone! ;)Spaß beiseite… Das 14er ist prima. Super OLED Display mit flüssigen 120 Hz und „always on“ und eine wirklich gute Kamera. Wenn das so weitergeht brauche ich meine DSLR echt nur noch für schlechte Lichtverhältnisse.Akkulaufzeit hat sich spürbar verbessert. Performance war bei meinem alten 12 Pro auch noch super da.Die „Dynamic Isle“ also die Animationen zum „Verstecken“ der „Kamera-Notch“ sind wirklich gut gelungen. Apple schafft es immer wieder aus vermeintlichen Nachteilen einen Vorteil für die User zu machen.Grandios ist auch der Wechsel vom alten iPhone zum neuen. Es braucht nur Zeit und beide iPhones nebeneinander. Nach 2h war das neue iPhone inhaltlich wie das alte… so stelle ich mir eine Migration vor. Da macht das Wechseln noch mehr Spaß.Von mir klare Kaufempfehlung!

Das iPhone 14 Pro ist hierzulande aus bekannten Gründen teurer geworden. Das ist schmerzhaft, aber verschmerzbar. Wer ein Pro Modell kauft, braucht es. Und wer etwas braucht, ist bereit tiefer dafür in die Tasche zu greifen.Das iPhone 14 Pro führt die gewohnte Apple Qualität konsequent fort. Die neue Dynamic Island verbindet Unumgängliches mit Nützlichem. So merkt man die Kameraöffnung nicht mehr gewusst, sondern nimmt die Displayaussparung als Infobox war. Im Vollbildmodus bei Videos ist dies natürlich etwas ungewohnt, das war die Notch allerdings zu Beginn auch. Bei reiner 16:9 Wiedergabe ist die Dynamic Island nicht zu sehen, lediglich bei 21:9.Anzumerken ist die Farbe ""Space Black"". Optisch angehaucht vom Space Gray der vorherigen Modelle, ist gerade der Metallrahmen nun schön schwarz. Das wirkt nicht nur edler, sondern beugt auch Fingerabdrücken hervor.Ich denke man braucht nicht viel zum iPhone sagen. Wer es kennt, liebt es.Einen Punkt Abzug gibt es für Amazon. 1500€ verschickt man nicht in einem ungepolsterten Umschlag.

This is the first time I bought an iPhone and returned it as I was not completely happy with it (especially at that price).Don't get me wrong.. it is a great iPhone in 2022 probably the best. But..I own a 12 Pro and my wife has Xs. We both agreed that it is the time to get the new iPhone as it has many shiny new features compared to our existing phones. Especially in the camera department. To both of our surprise, the pictures are better but not vastly better than either of our phones. Scanning documents, which we do a lot, is worse on iPhone 14 Pro due to its larger sensor. You get only the middle of the document in focus and the edges are generally blurry text. The way to mitigate is to take the scan from more than a meter away and crop the image. Probably there is a software fix by now.Dynamic Island: is amazing implementation but again you loose more screen space compared to the notch and the coolness of it was worn out very fast in few days.Apart from the camera and the Dynamic island, there is pro motion which is really nice.The phone is also heavier and we both felt the bulk of it.My recommendation is to get it only if it is a must to use these new features otherwise a cheaper 13Pro does all the same things. I personally would choose the 14 (non pro) as it is lighter and I do not use the telephoto lens that much.Thank You for reading!

Die Apple Keynote versprach einige Neuerungen für's iPhone 14 ProBessere Fotos - ja, passt! 48MP - klingt erst einmal spannend, wobei ich im Vergleich zu meinem alten iPhone 12 Pro schon eine kleine Verbesserung da war.Besser Videoaufnahmen- definitiv, aber die Stabilisierung ist schon ziemlich perfekt.Dynamic Island - ist ganz nett und mal schauen was die Apps /software daraus machen wird in Zukunft.Insgesamt finde ich das Iphone 14 sehr gelungen.
"
3637,B0BDJ279KF,5,"
viel kann man nicht dazu sagen. Ein Upgrade vom 13 Pro lohnt sich überhaupt nicht, da beide Geräte, was Akkulaufzeit und Leistung angeht, ziemlich identisch sind. Die Kamerawerte sind zwar um einiges besser, ein Unterschied lässt sich bei den gemachten Bildern trotzdem nicht erkennen. Wer ein iPhone 12 oder älter hat, kann zum 14 (Pro) greifen, iPhone 13 Nutzern empfehle ich es nicht.
"
3638,B0BDJ279KF,5,"
Das Handy ist einfach zu Perfekt!!!!Es gibt nichts am Handy auszusetzen……Natürlich muss jeder für sich selbst entscheiden ob es einem der Hohe Preis wert ist…Mini Kritik von mir ist das es Keinen Netzteil und Kopfhörer dabei ist.

Sollte ein Besitzer von einem iPhone 13 Pro (Max) ernsthaft über ein ""update"" zum 14 Pro (Max) nachdenken - lasst es einfach sein. Davon abgesehen, dass die Max-Variante immer schwerer wird, ragt die Kamera nun noch mehr vom Gerät heraus. Der Unterschied zum Vorgänger ist zwar nur minimal. Legt man jedoch das Handy auf eine Tischoberfläche, liegt das Handy jetzt noch unruhiger da als zuvor. Und nein, das Handy auf das Display zu legen kommt für mich nicht in Frage.Leistungstechnisch merkt der User einfach null Unterschied. Die Geräte von Apple sind hardwaretechnisch vielleicht nicht in jedem Segment Platz 1, jedoch spielt eben diese Hardware perfekt mit der hauseigenen Software zusammen. Und das so gut, dass man hier schon vermutlich mehrere iPhone Generationen überspringen muss, um wirklich einen Leistungsunterschied zu merken.Das einzig ""neue"" Relevante ist dann wohl nur die Notch, welche mit dem 14 Pro etwas kleiner, mehr im Display stehend und interaktiv ist. Diese Interaktivität funktioniert aktuell jedoch nur mit Apple- bzw. Standardfunktionen wie Anrufe, Videos (YouTube, usw.) oder Musik. Fremdhersteller müssen diese neue Möglichkeit der Notch wohl noch implementieren.Schön sind diese Handys immer noch, jedoch ist nach all den Jahren irgendwie die Innovation auf der Strecke geblieben. Mindestens 1.300 Euro für das Pro bzw. 1.450 EUR für das Pro Max (Preise jeweils für die kleinste Speichervariante mit 128GB), um eine neue Notch oder Allways-On-Display zu haben, dies ist - vor allem in der aktuellen wirtschaftlichen Lage - einfach nicht sinnvoll. Für jemanden, der ein sehr altes iPhone oder gar keins hat, und somit immer iOS und Co genießen wollte, und bereit ist diese Preise zu zahlen, kann natürlich gern zuschlagen, da Apple seine Geräte einige Jahre länger mit Updates Supporten als so manch ein Konkurrent und preisstabiler sind diese Handys ebenfalls.

Starke Akkulaufzeit und exzellente Leistung mit sehr gute Fotos und ein richtig tolles Display. Im ersten Eindruck punktet das iPhone 14 Pro in allen Kategorien. Die Ausstattung bekommt von mir ein großes Lob aber warum Apple immer noch auf den langsamen Lightning-Port setzt bleibt mir ein Rätsel. Highlight des iPhone 14 Pro ist die neue 48-Megapixel Hauptkamera und den neuen Autofokus für die Selfie-Kamera. Innovativ sind zwei neue Notfall Systeme die automatisch Autounfälle erkennen und Hilfe rufen. Der Hilferuf ist auch über GPS-Satelliten möglich. Die neue Videofunktion „Action-Mode“ ist eine tolle Bereicherung. Das neue Notch-Design mit den praktischen Software-Feature  „Dynamic-Island“ ist mein persönliches Highlight. So macht es richtig Spaß 👍🏻

Die kamera hat durch den makrofokus und 3 fach optischen zoom auf jedenfall zugelegt, die helligkeit ist wirklich top gerade auch wenn die sonne scheint, und der akku hält länger als es von den daten den anschein hat! Innerhalb von 7 std bei gelegentlicher nutzung gerade mal 20-25% vom akkus verbraucht, das ist echt top 👍
"
3651,B0BDJ279KF,5,"
Genau so  habe ich das iPhone 14pro erwartet. Nicht mehr und nicht weniger. Dieses matte violett ist mega. Die Verarbeitung ist top - das ist für mich aber bei diesem Preis aber eine Selbstverständlichkeit. Von der Akku-Laufzeit bin ich noch nicht ganz überzeugt. Aber nach erst 5x laden, sollte sich diese noch etwas verbessern.Ob es unbedingt ein iPhone sein muss, entscheidet jeder für sich. Und ja, es ist nur ein Telefon mit einer top Kamera.Ich bin jedenfalls nach meinem Upgrade vom iPhone 11 auf dieses sehr begeistert.

Über die bisher bekannten und herausgefunden pro und Cons wurde bereits in vielen Foren und Internet Artikel geschrieben. Am Ende muss man sich selbst ein Bild machen! Ob das neue iPhone für jeden eine Verbesserung ist, liegt deshalb vermutlich immer im Auge des Betrachters! Das Upgrade von bisherigen Modellen auf das iPhone 14 pro ist allerdings definitiv spürbar, sichtbar und im täglichen doing definitiv ein Mehrwert!Besonders beeindruckend ist die Schnelligkeit, die Kamera und die Symbiosen von Soft- & Hardware! ☺️

Das Non-Plus Ultra der Smartphones, mehr gibt es dazu eigentlich nicht zu sagen. Auspacken - neben das alte iPhone legen, warten.

Beim Umstieg vom iPhone X auf iPhone 14 Pro lohnt es sich auf jeden Fall. Die Kamera, besonders der Nachtmodus und Makromodus, welche mir wichtig sind, sind quasi ein Quantensprung. Das Gehäuse ist sehr hochwertig und durch das kantige Design griffiger und nicht so anfällig gegen Fingerabdrücke, wie die Glasrückseite des iPhone X. Reicht wieder für mindestens 5 Jahre, deshalb ist mir der Preis auch relativ egal.
"
3662,B0BDJ279KF,5,"
Wie gewohnt liefert Apple absolut herausragende Qualität in Sachen Verarbeitung, Schnelligkeit und Kamerafunktionen. Würde es jedem empfehlen, der bereit ist etwas mehr für ein iPhone zu bezahlen, da der Unterschied zum „normalen“ 14er ziemlich groß ist.
"
3663,B0BDJ279KF,5,"
Ich habe lange überlegt, ob ich mein 11 Pro gegen ein 14 Pro eintauschen solle und ob sich dieser Preis lohnt bzw bemerkbar macht.Ganz klares Ergebnis: Es lohnt sich!!Das Display, die Kamera,… es ist eine Augenweide!Einzig und allein funktionierte der Übertrag meiner Daten nicht wie gelohnt, es dauerte sehr lange, nicht alle Daten wurden übernommen und insgesamt war die Performance schlechter als bei meinem früheren 11 Pro.
"

Ich bin vom iPhone 12 auf das 14 Pro umgestiegen. Der Kauf hat sich definitiv gelohnt! Das Handy ist in allen Belangen spürbar besser und durch die neue Dynamik Island und das Always On Display sind zum ersten Mal deutlich größere Änderungen zu den Vorjahres Modellen vorhanden!

I’m writing this review because I had an iphone 13 pro and I’ve been using it for almost one year, and I have to say the battery on the 14 pro is much worse. And the usage I do of the phone is exactly the same. Yes it has some improvements with respect to its predecessor but I’m not sure it’s worth the extra money, at least in my case. For me the battery duration is key.Moreover, the 48 megapixel camera… Yes it’s 48Mp but it doesn’t work in night mode, so  eventually their use is quite limited

Ich werde Amazon kontaktieren und entweder gibt es ersatz oder es geht zurück. Sorry Apple, aber eine gewisse Qualität ist bei Produkten dieser Preiskategorie ein MUSS.

Kaum angekommen und ausgepackt hielt es einen Tag, ABER: Ab dem zweiten Tag hängt es sich alle 10 Minuten auf und benötigt einen Neustart, so ein Handy kann ich nicht gebrauchen, dass dies bei Apple passiert ist unglaublich. Bei Samsung hatte ich sowas noch nie. Rücksendung ist angefordert, für diesen Preis erwarte ich ein funktionierendes Handy.

I, like everyone else considering this product, was a bit wary of ordering a renewed phone instead of a new one, without seeing it first anyway. However, upon arrival & first look the phone is in impeccable condition! Everything seems to work as it should and the screen, edges, cameras etc are all free from any signs of use. I do however have two criticisms. The first, is that the battery health is only at 83%. My old iPhone is better than that at around 91/92! Still, it’s a second hand phone and it works. It’s really not the end of the world. It does it’s job and seems fine.My main issue was the delivery. When I heard that the phone was being sent through Evri my heart sank. I’ve lost so many parcels with them lately, this is actually the first parcel I’ve ever had arrive in one piece from them. The parcel was lost, then turned up again, then lost again, delayed, and finally arrived a week after it was due and then thrown over my 6ft garden fence. Luckily however, the phone is in one piece. I would just urge the seller to reconsider who they are using to send these devices.I would gladly buy another device from this company when the time comes, but not if Evri are taking anything to do with it.

My battery life was 85% , I thought it was too bad for having taken the excellent one... He thought he should specify more details, especially about battery life. :(

I had been waiting iPhone 14 to be released before deciding which phone to go for. I would normally buy the latest phone unlocked and choose the best monthly rolling sim option. However, after weighing up the cost and functionality (iPhone 14 seemed a marginal functionality improvement at significantly increased cost), I came to the conclusion that a renewed iPhone 12 pro max offered much better value at around half the price. I choose the 'excellent condition' and have been very pleased with the result - especially as this is the first time I have taken this route. I have had the phone from Phones Direct for almost a month now and there have been no issues. There were no scratches/blemishes. The battery health was 87% and has remained so (the guarantee is >80%). I would have liked more (who wouldn't!) but it hasn't been an issue. Would definitely recommend

The screen freezes quite often and the battery life is a bit low but it looks absolutely fine. But mine didn’t come with a charger or a plug

It didn’t come with screen protection and phone cover

I was wary about going for a refurbished phone after reading reviews about other so called market leading companies, however the feedback on this company made me take the plunge and I’m glad I did.  Quick delivery and the condition is as good as out of the box new but at massive discount, battery maximum capacity is 86% which is not an an issue.  The added bonus was the 12 month interest free payment option which was quick and easy to set up.  I kept my current unlimited data contract so it was a simple switch over of the SIM once the phones had synchronised with each other, it’s so easy these days!  I’ve estimated a saving over 2 years of around £700 compared with getting a refurbished phone of this specification from my service provider.  Bargain!

Excellent like new

3700,B08PCCQT8D,4,"
It's a great phone, like new and faultless performance. The battery life isn't wonderful but adequate. Nevertheless I'm really pleased with it, who needs iPhone 13 or 14?

I am absolutely shocked and appalled by the service and product that has been provided to me. I bought this phone as a Grade A iPhone 12 Pro Max, fully refurbished. I used this phone for around 2 months before it became completely unusable. I was using my phone as normal, when one day the screen just stopped working entirely. I thought maybe it was just a glitch and did everything that usually fixes the problem, restart, update etc. But nothing worked.I contacted Clover Mobiles and sent my phone off to be repaired; they refused to cooperate unless I payed a further £325 for a new screen, which was not even damaged at all. They didn't bother to look at the phone at all and decided the fault was due to a drop because there was a minor blemish on the corner of the phone. I decided to do some research myself and the component that processes touch on the phone, called a digitiser, cannot be broken simply from a drop on this model of phone. This proves Clover did nothing to look at the product or even try and find a solution.To make matters worse, I then spoke to an Amazon member of staff who informed me I can get a full refund for the entire amount of the product; I was extremely happy to hear this only for the horrendous staff at Clover to inform me that if I send the phone back they will just send it straight back to me. Amazon have let me down by saying I will be getting a full refund, only to be turned down by the seller. The phone even has a 1 year return policy if it doesn't work, which it doesn't!So after hearing this, I decided to look inside the phone to see if anything is loose or broken inside, which I could not break myself. And the inside of the phone is in such poor condition; there is soldering work that is so poorly done and the back of the screen, has a rip, I assume (like Clover Mobiles do), from a previous repair on the phone. Please see the images above and I implore you not to buy a product from these sellers, I do not want anyone else in the same situation.

3704,B08PCCQT8D,4,"
Phone has a fault when on calls the volume cuts down very low.  The company are happy to change it but unlike if you purchase direct from Apple they will not send you a replacement to transfer your pictures music etc over before having to send back.  Bare this in mind it could be worth paying the extra to Apple as in warranty service is the best ever.

Straight out of the packaging this phone looks like it’s NEW, not a mark on it!Battery life shows at 100% 😲So far it seems to be working perfectly!Comes with 1 year warranty, too! 🧐Excellent value for money on this refurbished phone 😁Absolutely recommended!

I was pleasantly surprised by this phone which was sent by Phones Direct Uk. I have been using it for almost a week now and have encountered absolutely no issues. Battery health was at 90% which I can’t really complain about. As for the actual body of the phone itself, it came in perfect condition, no marks or scratches at all on any part of the phone. Speakers work perfectly, as well as touchscreen, cameras, face ID, etc. I would definitely recommend buying refurbished through Amazon for a fair price, rather than the extortionate prices charged elsewhere. Less than £700 for what looks and acts like a brand new iPhone that is a fairly recent release. I know through Amazon Marketplace phones are sent from different individual companies so I cannot speak for all, but I am very happy with the phone I’ve received.

In a nutshell, the iPhone 12 pro max I bought is like a new phone. I never purchased a second-hand phone before, I have no regrets about buying this one I’m planning to buy another phone from the seller again. I hereby recommend this seller, I never believed that second-hand phones would be in that excellent condition.
"
3727,B08PCCQT8D,3,"
Battery health is not good it’s just  83% it was bit disappointing. They should write’s exact battery health.

This is my first ever Iphone and so far I have been okay with it,I got a very good condition barely used phone and no damages or marks around it ( might got lucky)everything is currently working as it should, Yes it's high on price but still its Apple sadly
"
3729,B08PCCQT8D,3,"
Unfortunately the phone sides were scratched deeply . The screen and back were clear though . It seemed that the previous owner had been a bit careless .The scratches were deep enough to be felt and the metallic rim felt as though it was rusted ??I used first class mail to return the iPhone , cost me 5.5 £ , the seller only refunded the phone cost even though it was clearly mentioned that the return cost will be refunded as well .The phone had not been cleaned either .Though battery was working as advertised and phone didn't have any other obvious defect .Over all a poor experience on Amazon and by the seller .Will stick to first hand goods only in future .

I actually didn’t realise the phone was a used renewed phone when I bought it, thought it was brand new but either way it came in immaculate condition with no visible signs of use. Hopefully there aren’t any problems as time goes by! But for now very good
"
3734,B08PCCQT8D,2,"
I'm going to keep it short and sweet - Ordered three phones from three different vendors, each supposedly in ""excellent condition"". First one had a severely deteriorated battery apparently, second had a bizarre screen fitted that was definitely not Apple. Maybe it was pear. Third has chips all around the bezel and the PVC coating has worn away. Note: the last two also had battery lives of 80% and 83%. If this is excellent quality, what do you get with ""acceptable"" - The bezel alone?
"
3735,B08PCCQT8D,5,"
Face recognition is so easy and much better security than I’ve had previously. I’ve never been an iPhone fan but my husband bought me this and I must admit I love everything about it.

First time buying a refurbished phone. Look like a new!! Ordered yesterday received today. Easy set up. Can’t wait to write this review.  Will keep you updated after a few months’ use.After a month, not sure about the screen. It’s dull although brightness is adjust to 90%.Sometimes the screen keeps flipping when I press my finger on certain app. Don’t know why.
"
3739,B08PCCQT8D,5,"
I've had this product for one week now. Battery came at 89% after a few days usage it went to 88%. But, it still lasts me all day! It's a big change for me as I've had an iPhone 8 Plus over the past couple of years. I was quite skeptical about ordering this product but I took the risk and I'm happy so far! :) Really wanted to buy a iPhone 12 Pro Max outright at a good price and it's great that it can be returned within a year!They delivered it within a day. No major scratches on the phone, it was just dirty around the camera lenses and in the mute button. Everything else is brilliant so far, the back and front camera quality is amazing! I have no other complaints, will update this review over the coming months.

My wife has serious phone envy when she sees the photos I take on my iPhone 12 Pro Max and the way it syncs with my iPad. So, being the loving husband I decided to buy her the same phone, but refurbished to save hundreds of pounds on what I paid for mine new about 9 months ago.I was almost put off by the reviews on here, but decided to buy as I knew I could return the phone if it was damaged in any way.I made the right decision and my wife is delighted. The phone looks like it is new and has 100% battery life. Mega brownie points for me.And the 1 year warranty is fantastic.We just have to see now who can take the best photos with our top of the range iPhones.

I was worried about spending £600 on a reconditioned phone, but after reading reviews on the seller went for a iphone 12 max pro.Phoned arrived in good time, package was basic, with charging cable, plug, and card removal pin.Phone is spotless, looks brand new with no visible marks at all... screen is also totally mark free, all systems working fine, and the battery is saying its at 98% chargeable to its max level. All in all very happy with my purchase.
"
3745,B08PCCQT8D,5,"
When I received my new phone, they included a charger which apple don’t do, a 100 percent battery life. It was worth buying.
"
3746,B08PCCQT8D,4,"
88% battery capacity when it arrived, surely for a refurbed unit put a new one in.
"
3747,B08PCCQT8D,5,"
I never write reviews but..... Brand new phone, not even a single scratch. Very pleased with this product. I would never buy an iphone from an Apple Store again! Good for your pocked and for the planer as well! Fast delivery comes with the essentials. I'll get back with a battery life review after 6 months. If you still wonder whether to buy it or now, go ahead, you won't regret it!

I just got this phone delivered to me yesterday.For the money i spent i can say it is in a decent shape.It has some scratches on the screen which are pretty visible, on the sides as well.Overall i am quite happy with the product, it came with 96% battery so i dunno.Delivery was ok too.

3751,B08PCCQT8D,2,"
Battery was 88 % this is 3 years worth of useI recommend battery replacement , i contacted the seller and they were happy if its over 80%I wish to be considered for a replacement with a better battery health same condition though
"
3752,B08PCCQT8D,5,"
So the Iphone came the next day i made the purchase.90% Battery Life, honestly no scratch and including things on the photo (charger plug, cable and a voucher… also the phone). If this is a second hand phone, shows then that previous owner used to keep it with case and protector (same as me) so happy for the purchase.I would have preferred signed delivery from Royal Mail maybe (as it is an expensive parcel), but if you organize well yourself, you can pick it up quickly.Hope this helps
"
3753,B08PCCQT8D,5,"
I’ve been using the phone for a few weeks now, and it is much better than I thought it would be. I upgraded from the 7 plus, and was very pleased at the quality of the phone when it arrived. There were no scratches, and the battery was 92% of a brand new phone (the description said it would guarantee 80%). I definitely saved a lot of money!
"
3754,B08PCCQT8D,5,"
I am really impressed with the value of the phone I received! I was a bit sceptical at first knowing that it was a refurbished iPhone however once I received my package I was overjoyed with what I had been given! The phone looks almost brand new! No scratches on the screen, the sides are in perfect condition and the back is immaculate!! The battery health on the phone is 92% which ofc isn’t perfect but the phone still last well over a day, and I’d say I use my phone moderately to high amount!!I got the iPhone 12 Pro Max Blue 256GB two days after I ordered it! Even though it said it would take about a week!10/10 for this! Very impressed!
"
3755,B08PCCQT8D,3,"
Cannot fault the quality of the device itself, looks like new! However, the phone comes with a Lighting>USBC cable but a USB A adapter, so that’s not very helpful, could be wrong? The other thing was that the phone came with 0% battery so couldn’t turn it on for a while and I thought something was wrong with it at first as I had it on charge for 30 minutes before it seemed to come into life?!Lastly, delivery - you cannot choose Amazon locker and DPD just left it on the floor outside the house which is pretty crazy considering the cost of it
"
3756,B08PCCQT8D,4,"
This good for value

I Was dubious about spending £700 on a used phone but after receiving this flagship iPhone, I couldn’t be happier. Face recognition works perfectly, battery health is 100…… yes 100%, and the phone itself is near perfect. One tiny scratch on the top edge. That’s it, apart from an even smaller scratch on the screen that I’ll never even notice. I only saw it while I was scrutinising the whole phone. In addition, you get an Apple adapter (unlike with a new iPhone).Amazon renewed from now on for my next iPhone.
"
3761,B08PCCQT8D,3,"
Unfortunately the phone was received with a crack in the corner on the screen. Easy to miss unless viewed at an angle in daylight. We all make mistakes. Apart from that excellent service and fantastic iPhone.

There’s always a little bit of trepidation when buyingSomething second hand but this time very happy with the phone . No marks scratches whatsoever just looks like new with a massive saving.
"
3764,B08PCCQT8D,2,"
Having ordered several renewed phones from Amazon. I might give it a miss from now on as suppliers are now supplying phones with the battery at 81% health. My older iPhone 8+ has a better life than that and this newer model was purchased to replace it. But as the Amazon rule is 80% some suppliers are using this to their advantage to get shot of their stock.  The phone was quite dirty when delivered but no visible scratches which was probably the only bonus.  If you up for a game of chance go for it but ideally I’ll go somewhere where I can visibly see the product before purchase.
"
3765,B08PCCQT8D,4,"

"
3768,B08PCCQT8D,1,"
Bought IPhone 12 Pro Max as a present for a relative. Supposedly grade A condition, come with large very noticeable scratch. Tried using portrait mode on camera which would go completely black and not work and then also not let any other option be selected on the camera to take a normal photograph. When receiving a call the phone would completely freeze and not work to the point of having to reset the whole phone and set up as new. Thought with being a grade A it would be fine to buy refurbished but I would 100% advise anyone to not buy second hand or from this seller.
"
3769,B08PCCQT8D,2,"
Came with a few scratches but most thing I don’t like how it’s screen has been polished poorly to get rid of its scratches not the best pleased but have it under a screen protector so don’t see it but you’d think for the amount of money you spend you’d think it would be better musicmagpie I wouldn’t rate 👎🏻

Camera had many faults including a black dot on screen when using the 2.5x lens. This would appear in every photo taken using that lens. Also, reflections would occur on images as seen in image two with the cat. This is not acceptable on a £660 phone. The battery capacity was at 89% when received and although this is not the worst it could be (as stated they sell phones with up to 80% capacity), this combined with the faulty camera really made the phone not acceptable. I would strongly recommend not buying this product.

Phone may not have come with it's original box or charger, but I did get an original Apple cable and the charger that came with came with dual USB-A ports, which is even more useful.
"
3780,B08PCCQT8D,5,"
If you have any doubts, kill them immediately. Only thing that was disappointing is that the phone came with the old USB to lightning cable as opposed to the new USB C to lightning cable. But besides that, this thing is an amazing buy for the price
"
3781,B08PCCQT8D,1,"
Very disappointed in the condition of the phone I received! I paid for excellent condition, however that wasn’t what I received!The camera lenses, all 3 lenses were chipped around the edges! The gold casing around the phone was all scratched.I didn’t even turn the phone on, as wasn’t accepting it in the condition I received it.Very disappointing indeed!

I will never buy a new iPhone again bought the 12pro max renewed it is in as new condition not a single fingerprint never mind a scratch on the phone, battery health at 95% which is as close to perfect as I could expect, and only £650 really it is 5* if you need a phone use this service
"
3783,B08PCCQT8D,5,"
99% battery and not a mark on it and virtually half price! Pained me to have to buy one as I was robbed but really pleased with value for money and will probably never buy new again!
"
3784,B08PCCQT8D,5,"
Was slightly worried about some negative reviews and risks with getting a refurbished iPhone, but it turned out great. Only negatives are the fact it doesn't come in the original box, and the cable is USB-B. The device itself is absolutely spotless, not a single scratch detected after I looked closely for a good 10mn.The battery shows 99% so no complaint here either. Really good experience overall, would definitely recommend.
"
3785,B08PCCQT8D,1,"
Disappointed as it does not come with a basic charger, so what's the point and you cannot check the item as it needs charging, typical, so first impressions are very very poor

The phone arrived earlier than expected. Except there is couple of minor scratches (hardly visible) on the screen otherwise looks brand new. I’m very happy with my purchase
"
3788,B08PCCQT8D,2,"
Not to the high standard of ‘renewed’ from Amazon that I have been used to in the past.The screen is badly scratched, the bezel edge around the screen is chipped and the ear speaker is not working when making or receiving calls.A far cry from the “This product works and looks like new.” and the “Excellent condition (Refurbished)” write up.

I am giving it 1 star because it is a really terrible experience for me in my purchase life. I got a not working cable and I requested it again and again but the seller did not solve it.

Phone arrived 1 day in advance and in perfect condition.No scratches! It works perfectly.

Well everything other than the screen was as described, apple notified me straight away that the screen/display was FAKE therefore had no choice but to return.

I thought buying a refurbished was not only good for recycling/planet but also getting an up to date phone cheaper seeing as most phones have built in obsolescence now.  Unfortunately the phone I received, although in excellent condition, produced exceptional heat during my use, so much so, I turned it off as I was concerned about it exploding and further consideration that it would catch fire during the night etc.  i contacted the company and was asking did I use it while it was being charged, I queried this as with my previous iPhone I used while being charged without problems.  I was happy to have it repaired providing the battery, if that was the problem, or other parts were Apple accredited but was advised that the parts were not Apple but other manufacturers replication which concerned me once more, I then requested a refund.  So I would suggest to anyone, be careful when purchasing a refurbished phone or just buy a cheaper model if your budget restraint is a consideration.

I was initially concerned about buying a renewed but after receiving it today I could not be happier. Phone is in perfect condition, came with a screen protector already installed. Battery percentage at 92%. Very pleased with the purchase
"
3801,B08PCCQT8D,5,"
I love the mobile. It came with 95% battery without a single scratch. Looks like a brand new one. I really appreciate the customer support. They are very reliable sellers. Close eyes and buy from them.

The product description which states: ""No signs of cosmetic damage (scratches, dents, etc.) will be visible when the product is held 30 centimeters away"" turned out be a complete lie. The phone came with 2 very noticeable scratches on its screen, which more on its sides. There is also chip damage on its upper corner. These are all viseable from a metre away in a normally lit room, which become very obvious outside and under room lights. The delivery was fast and reliable so can't fault them there.

I would not advise anyone one to get this product, better to save money and buy a new iphone, or better still, getting one on a contract would sufficeThe device quality is absolutely poor, from the camera quality down to the battery. Quality is not as described by the seller, just deceit. I have requested for a refund and hope I would get back my moneyI have purchased some supposed quality products that turned out defective  however, this is worst, I have never regretted purchasing an item of this nature before..

To begin, the package arrived three days earlier than expected, which was surprising; the phone itself was not in a box upon arrival, which was worrying, although the phone was covered in a thick layer of plastic wrap.  I did see some minor scratches on the screen, but they were not noticeable unless you looked closely.  Otherwise, there was no other damage.  The phone was a bit dirty but was easily cleaned.After using the phone for about a month, I realized this was an excellent upgrade.  Yes, it was expensive, although I moved up from an iPhone 8, so the pros outweighed the cons.  What are the cons?  The maximum hold on the battery is 91%, not fantastic, but it is way better than my iPhone 8; it outlives that phone by a mile.  It is a heavier phone, and I wasn't expecting the weight of it.  I can hold it with one hand and still type with the holding hand, although the weight on my pinky as I hold it up does hurt after a while.  The price was quite a bit for a refurbished phone, in my opinion, but as an upgrade, the phone is impressive.For Pros, this phone has a different layout; it took me a mere week to get over the fact there is no button; remember, I upgraded from an iPhone 8, where the button still exists.  Honestly, I prefer face recognition; it is just way more easier to do anything, rather than failing the touch ID over and over.  Again as the battery was also a con, it is also a pro; it lasts way longer than my iPhone 8 ever did.  Something I shouldn't have to go over, but the camera is divine; it is so surreal to me.  I love it.  As for calling people and so on, everyone can hear me very clearly, and I hear them better.  Lastly, the speakers are excellent; I feel like it is surround sound almost, compared to my iPhone 8, this iPhone 12 Pro Max is just outstanding.Overall, this was a wonderful upgrade, although it did have some cons as not everything is perfect.

Relieved when my phone arrived in a really lovely environmentally friendly box. No damage or scratches to be seen on the phone at all, looks brand new, battery life 90%. Was ready to be set up with about 10% charge. Came with a plug and charging cable. As you can see on the photo it can be registered for a one year warranty. Bought through UR, delivered by Royal Mail 48hrs after ordering. Will defos come back to them in a few years to upgrade once more. Highly recommend.

3856,B08PCCQT8D,5,"
The product was delivered on time and in great condition. After thinking about whether I should get a 12 pro max or 13, I'm glad I got this. I'm still getting use to the very big screen but it's also another reason I like the phone—definitely, value for money.Just a slight thing tho, the packaging could have been better as it came in a cardboard box with very little protection.

This is my first time of buying a renewed iPhone from Amazon. The product is in excellent condition with a battery level of 85%. The phone is very clean with no mark at all. It is working perfectly well. It is a good way to save money on a latest phone.The price is very competitive and delivery was super fast. Excellent customer service from Amazon as usual.I strongly recommend renewed phones, there is no much difference with brand new and you will save a lot of money.The guarantee is One year as well, and mine came with Apple care till 12 November 2022.

Cannot fault this phone! I was slightly sceptical to buy a refurbished phone but I did not need to worry, Mazuma (provider might be different for others) really pulled through! Perfect condition and 100% battery health, it was already charged so I could use it straight away. Definitely worth getting a more reasonably priced iPhone 12 Pro Max than the iPhone Pro Max 13, which only has a couple more features that I wouldn't even care about. Thanks again Mazuma!
"
3870,B08PCCQT8D,5,"
Wonderful!! Really wonderful
"
3871,B08PCCQT8D,5,"
It’s a very good and just the right size too. The only problem is that the battery health being a bit low at 91% but that not a big deal to me as it still lasts me the entire day without charging it.

Great phone so far, always wary with refurb but with Amazon 1 year hopefully cross fingers will be ok, advert states a plug included they seem to disagree, wrong lead sent but am using my original lead, definitely worth upgrade from XR to 12 Pro Max. Disappointed with 82% battery others state they had 95% at least may have to replace battery sooner than I thought
"
3875,B08PCCQT8D,5,"
The phone works perfectly well. It is exactly what was described in the advert. Battery life 87%. I have no reason to complain.

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 £740 is a big old chunk of cash to spend when some of the reviews showed trashed phones and talked of difficult returns. I had decided to buy a new iPhone at £1000 instead because of the bad reviews but there was a 2 month wait and I’m inpatient so rolled the dice. As you can see in the video of me opening the package the 12 ProMax I got was pristine, battery health was 99% and I’m delighted, it comes well packaged in a box similar to the Apple design with a generic lightning charger and sim pin. I think it would be useful if the condition of the actual phone you’ll get was somewhere in the description rather than generic text, I know three conditions are described in one of the pictures but I could not find these referenced in the description.
"
3877,B08PCCQT8D,5,"
I was slightly worried after ordering this product as I’ve started to read through the reviews of convincing lack of quality from this company but nothing could be further from the truth.I have ordered the refurbished phone (close to new), I have done every check on the phone that I possibly could and I’ve concluded that the product I received was worth every penny. If you’re the type to care about the smallest scuff on your phone then please just buy a brand new phone. My screen has a couple scratches but it was not noticeable unless you look through a microcope. They have not cut any corners, full OLED screen, camera is crisp, touch screen has no faults.The only negative that alot of people seem to share is the battery percentage but that’s a loss I can take for the price. Anyways worry not, you’re safe with this purchase. :)Edit: wow, didn't expect that many people to find this review helpful. glad i could help.

The phone's physical condition is good, with no scratches; it looks like a brand-new iPhone.  I liked the phone's colour (pacific blue), and the battery health was around 88% when it arrived. The camera is working fine. After using it for more than a month now, I am satisfied with my purchase. Worth investing. No screen freeze or other issues.

"
3882,B08PCCQT8D,4,"
Really good quality, no scratches or scuffs at all. The only problem is the battery health. It’s not too bad but 86% isn’t the best considering it’s £700. Except for that it’s great!

First time buying a renewed phone but my iPhone X was so painful to use + Face ID didn’t work and front camera didn’t work from where I smashed the screen, it was like that for 2 years and I had finally had enough, looked around for a while, compared specs of 12, 13, 14 pro max, not much in it compared with the price scaling, looked on back market and almost ordered from there, checked trust pilot and there were a lot of bad reviews, checked on here, found this, ordered it, it came, barely a thing wrong with it, the tiniest mark on the screen which I can’t even see with a screen protector on, cameras work perfectly, Face ID works perfectly, battery life is impeccable, this was such a good deal and I feel so lucky to have come across it, it sounds dumb but it feels so good to have a newer faster phone like I don’t know, it just feels great, I love it, will definitely be doing this again in years time or however long I can make this phone last for! 😁 100% recommend!

La confezione è spartanissima, il prodotto è  giunto in buone condizioni,  ed anche se la scocca i gusci ed il vetro sono perfetti, la batterie era all85% anche se comprato  come “perfette condizioni” inavvertitamente ci è caduta un po di acqua sopra e per 15 minuti anche se spento e perfettamente asciugato alla riaccensione l'alto parlante ed il microfono gracchiavano.Quindi in ansia per lIP 68 che credo non vi sia.

Il telefono è perfetto. Le condizioni erano pari al nuovo e così infatti è risultato. Sembra quasi che nessuno l’abbia mai utilizzato. Nessun graffio e nessuna ammaccatura. Se si vuole acquistare un ricondizionato è bene stare attenti al grado riguardanti le condizioni. Avendo acquistato diversi ricondizionati non mi sono trovata mai male nel scegliere quelli in condizioni eccellenti o pari al nuovo. Unica piccola pecca può essere la batteria che si presenta all’89%. Ma avendo già avuto una batteria simile posso dire che non crea nessun tipo di problema.Oltre al telefono nella scatola era presente il cavetto con il caricatore originali e con la pellicola di imballaggio della Apple. Quindi mai usati.Mi sento di consigliare vivamente questo venditore.
"
3892,B08PCCQT8D,5,"
Sono rimasto veramente sorpreso. Il telefono è arrivato con 1 giorno di anticipo. Display come nuovo, nemmeno un micro graffio. Parte posteriore del telefono come nuova. L'unica pecca è il bordo con 6 micro ammaccature, ma anche con una cover trasparente non si vedono. Stato della batteria al 96%. Il telefono funziona perfettamente. Rapporto qualità prezzo super bilanciato. 5 stelle meritatissime!
"
3893,B08PCCQT8D,5,"
Edit: acquistato in grafite per mio marito, arrivato iPhone altrettanto perfetto al mio, con batteria altrettanto al 91%. Immacolato letteralmente pari al nuovo👏🏼Per ora - non sapessi di averlo pagato quel che ho pagato e non ci fosse la batteria al 91% (su tel di due anni), penserei che si tratti di un iPhone nuovo di pacco😱Esteticamente immacolato. Non un segno graffio o ombra👍🏼Al momento, perfettamente funzionante👍🏼Vedremo nel tempo…ma a prescindere vado tranquilla grazie alla garanzia Amazon Renewed che consente reso e rimborso per un anno intero 🙏🏼 grazie Amazon e grazie al venditore che me lo ha spedito con velocità da teletrasporto - quando in teoria arrivava 10gg dopo. Eccezionale.

Esperienza al di sopra delle aspettative. Il prodotto è arrivato in due giorni lavorativi, molto meglio del previsto, in un imballo corretto. L’iphone ha la batteria al 100%, il fondo sostituito con parte originale Apple e non presenta nessun segno o graffio visibile. Praticamente un prodotto nuovo.

Es el tercer móvil que compro de Amazon, y el único que me llega con buena salud de batería . A la tercera va la vencida !!! . La verdad es que estoy encantada con el, es precioso, me vino con un par de rasguñitos pequeños en el lateral, pero nada que una funda no tape, la salud de la batería me llego con un 97%. Un chollo. Estoy contentísima. Lo que pasa es que puedes tener la suerte de que te llegue con un 80% de salud(como mi anterior iPhone XS Max) o con un 97% de salud(como este mismo)Pero a mi me parece genial económicamente esta opción de poder comprar reacondicionados. Solo que como dije antes, puede salirte bien, o no. En caso de no salirte bien la batería, devuelves y pruebas otro.

avendo letto altre recensioni di resi per danneggiamento allo schermo o al corpo del telefono ero titubante, ma il telefono è arrivato con un giorno di anticipo ed era perfetto.zero segni o graffi, come da immagini allegate.nella scatola trovate anche il caricatore, il cavo usb c/lightning e la graffetta a spillo per estrarre/inserire la sim (che erano un po’ buttati lì a caso, ma per un ricondizionato non originale non mi formalizzerei).consiglio l’acquisto, anche perché garantito dal reso Amazon per un anno (motivo principale che mi ha spinto all’acquisto nonostante i dubbi di cui sopra).UPDATE: a distanza di un paio di giorni mi sono resa conto che la batteria si scaricava in modo strano, e andando a cercare tra le impostazioni ho visto che il suo stato di salute era di una carica massima dell'87%. ho fatto il reso e sto attendendo il rimborso
"

3906,B08PCCQT8D,5,"
Venia con una de las cámaras un poco rallada(que no influye para nada). La única pega que le podría poner es que me vino con un 82% de salud de batería, pero igualmente aguanta un día entero sin problemas ni fallos, al precio que lo he comprado es normal que tenga algún detallito. Una batería nueva tampoco vale mucho, llevo un mes de uso y va perfecto y tiene garantía.

Acquistato dal rivenditore Phonem arrivato in tempi brevissimi 2 giorni il cell si presenta nuovo con nessun graffio e ammaccatura! Batteria 82 % ma questo lo sapevo già visto che c’era scritto nella descrizione del prodotto.Per adesso sono soddisfattissimo ottimo venditore consigliato!

Questo Iphone ricondizionato e in ottime condizioni funziona al momento in modo perfetto come se fosse nuovo,  Buona anche la durata della  batteria
"
3912,B08PCCQT8D,4,"
Tutto perfetto tranne la batteria che e all'82%100,avendolo comprato nuovo pagato 890 euro circa un mese fà era giusto che la batteria fosse 100%100,sono delusa non lo ricomprerei a meno che non mi garantirebbero la garanzia della batteria al 100%100

Je ne prends d'habitude pas le temps d'écrire un commentaire mais je ferai une exception cette fois ci. Quelle bonne surprise. Comme beaucoup je me méfiais d'une mauvaise surprise en faisant le choix du reconditionné et bien je ne me suis trompé. J'ai acheté auprès de ce vendeur un iPhone 12 Pro Max en excellent etat et le moins que l'on puisse dire c'est que la promesse est tenue. Etat impeccable, aucune rayure, livraison en avance. Et en prime une batterie à 94% de sa pleine capacité. Je suis ravi de mon achat.
"
3914,B08PCCQT8D,4,"
Juste la batterie qui est à 90% sinon rien à dire.

3916,B08PCCQT8D,3,"
Franchement pour un téléphone reconditionné nickel au niveau de esthétique rien à redire mais par contre la batterie a 79% de ça capacité alors que le téléphone coûte quand même 850 euro c’est vraiment abusé c’est vraiment dommage ça partait bien

J ai reçu mon telephone il etait parfait a part le son ! Je l ai montré a un spécialiste apple qui m a expliqué que rapidement cela allait lacher et j en aurai pour 200 euros ... j attend toujours mon etiquette prepayer car j ai reçu l accord pour le retour mais a mes frais !Ce n est pas ma faute si le telephone ne fonctionne pas donc... le service n est pas efficace et tres long pour la reponse et je me pose des questions pour le remboursement ....

"
3921,B08PCCQT8D,5,"
Telefono arrivato addirittura in anticipo,come nuovo nessun graffio tutto assolutamente funzionante grazie mille
"
3922,B08PCCQT8D,5,"
Il telefono è stato consegnato in condizioni eccellenti. Non presenta un minimo graffio, batteria completamente funzionante e il telefono svolge tutte le sue funzioni ed operazioni in tranquillità. Per essere un prodotto ricondizionato è davvero ottimo. In genere sono sempre stato scettico dei prodotti ricondizionati, ma questo acquisto mi ha lasciato davvero sorpreso. Consiglio vivamente a chiunque stia considerando di acquistare un telefono nuovo o voglia anche fare un regalo, il rapporto qualità prezzo è davvero il top.
"
3923,B08PCCQT8D,4,"
Sieht sehr neu aus, kein Kratzer und völlig zufrieden damit, aber eine Sache war ich nicht so zufrieden, die Batterie Kapazität war auf 84% was ich sehr schade finde! Sonst ist alles in Ordnung 👍

J'ai reçu le téléphone très récemment.👍👌Je vais évaluer le produit reconditionné.Le produit est arrivé:✅ Esthétique, dans un état proche du neuf.👌✅L'écran ne présente pas de rayures visibles.👌▶️Bon point , car il n'y a pas de verre de protection pour cacher la misère.😉🔺Un petit accroc sur le pourtour est visible mais reste mineur.🔺La batterie est à 84% de capacité maximum😕Dans la boîte un câble de charge et une épingle pour carte sim sont présents, ainsi qu'un chargeur.J'ai dans mon cas reçu le produit dans une boite ""no name"".😕.Photos à venir.En Conclusion: le produit est bon, je suis juste déçu pour la batterie.Dernier élément, c'est un modèle Usa, donc c'est embêtant car le téléphone n'est pas éligible sous Apple Care.Si utile, merci 👍🙂

3926,B08PCCQT8D,5,"
Puntualità e come descrizione. Senza un graffio ottimo prodotto
"
3927,B08PCCQT8D,5,"
Ho comprato il prodotto rigenerato e devo dire che sono rimasto a bocca aperta. E' come nuovo, non un graffietto, perfetto. Amazon sempre preciso come sempre, sia per gli acquisti che per i resi, insomma per tutto. Mai una sbavatura o qualcosa che mi abbia fatto storcere il naso nel corso degli anni. E io in genere non sono uno fortunato 😂 Grazie Amazon

La batteria ha una percentuale di usura altissima. Considerando che ho scelto la categoria con il costo più alto per avere il massimo.All’interno non c’è il cavo originale ma cinesataLo scatolone non è originale.
"
3936,B08PCCQT8D,5,"
Assolutamente prodotto perfetto come da descrizione e funzionante al top !!! Come averlo acquistato nuovo in negozio. Scatola non originale ma se non si fa la raccolta delle scatole dei propri telefono direi che è proprio l’ultima cosa alla quale guardare .
"

Le téléphone est intact, au défaut sur l'écran, l'arrière est nickel juste une minuscule égratignures au niveau d'une touche sur le côté mais faut vraiment regarder pour le voir et batterie à 97% . Franchement nous on on est super content, je vous recommande ce vendeur. Après ça fait seulement 3 jrs qu'on la donc j'espère qu'il n'y aura pas de soucis à la longue. Je sais pas si il y a une garantie sur l'article.
"

Il dispositivo è arrivato in condizioni estetiche perfette (si nota che è stata sostituita la parte posteriore) nessun graffio o segno di usura. Batteria al 94% (ben oltre le aspettative). Ho avuto un piccolo problema con lo speaker superiore risolto con un po’ di pulizia. Per ogni dubbio o informazione il venditore ha risposto sempre in maniera tempestiva.

Pas rayer. L’arrière est parfait.Le téléphone présente également des impacts, plusieurs. Le cadre en aluminium est également rayé et présente des imperfections visuelles autour des boutons.La batterie à une capacité de 87%, ce qui est correct.Je suis relativement satisfaite de mon achat, j’espère juste la durée dans le temps de mon produit.

3956,B08PCCQT8D,5,"
Producto 100 % original. Apple me llegó una caja que no es la original porque es un móvil reconstruido. Lo que no me gusta es que me vino con de Salud 83 % de batería ya que la batería la recomienda Apple para cambiarla a los 80 % de salud y se me descarga un poco rápido, pero el móvil me va súper bien. Estoy probando y ya te daré más detalles a lo largo del uso

Prodotto consegnato con carica batterie sbagliato infatti non è il 20 watt e non ha il cavetto appropriato poi in considerazione che ho acquistato un rigenerato in condizioni eccellenti non avrebbe dovuto riportare il vetro graffiato in ben tre punti. Come rigenerato è da considerare in buone condizioni ma non eccellenti. Batteria con resa all’83 per cento.

3967,B08PCCQT8D,1,"
Lieferung heute erhalten. Laut Beschreibung sollte es sich um ein generalüberholtes IPhone 12 Pro Max handeln, welches aussieht wie neu.Auf dem Display waren keine Macken, dafür umso mehr am Rahmen.An alle Ecken und Kanten befinden sich Kratzer und Riefen.Aber dann sowas als „Wie neu“ zu deklarieren ist eine Frechheit bei fast 800€. Karton war auch nicht original.Kabel und Ladegerät lagen separat in der Kiste. Billigste Ware (no Name)Akku Zustand bei 80% d.h. Fast 2 Jahre gebraucht.

3968,B08PCCQT8D,5,"
The store I got my phone from is called Flip4shop. I’m very happy with the purchase. The condition was listed as “acceptable” There are some scratches on the screen at a few locations, and some scratches at the lightning port, but I really don’t care. My old phone was way more scratched up than this. Just slap on a glass screen protector and a case and it’s good as new. The battery lifespan is at 98%. What’s important to me are that no glass is cracked and a good battery. I’d hazard a guess this was a display model at a phone shop and have been played around by customers. For the price it was very value for money and I would not hesitate to buy my next phone here with them again.

J’étais un peu septique à l’idée de prendre un téléphone reconditionné. Et franchement je suis agréablement surprise !! iPhone 12 Pro Max acheté en « excellent état » en effet comme neuf !! 0 micro rayures !! Vraiment en parfait parfait état. Petit bémol 92% de batterie mais bon à ce prix je suis satisfaite pour le moment . Téléphone acheté hier à 13h30 reçu le lendemain à la même heure !! Quelle rapidité !! Pourtant les délais de livraison l’annonçait 1 semaine d’attente . Bonne surprise

Pensavo che un ricondizionato avesse la batteria al 100%. Questo articolo Iphone 12 pro max ha invece una batteria già usata, per la precisione ha l'86% di capacità (allego foto). Dopo 2 giorni ho notato anche alcuni puntini bianchi, simili a piccole ammaccature sulla parte laterale  (superficiali) dell'Iphone che erano stati oscurati sicuramente con qualche pennarello, e dopo qualche ora di uso tornati alla luce.Ne usufruisco qualche altro giorno e capisco se chiedere il reso.
"

Ho acquistato un iPhone 12 pro Max in condizioni eccellenti quindi al prezzo più alto. È arrivato in tempi brevi ma appena aperto il pacco mi ritrovo un telefono che non è in condizioni eccellenti come da descrizione poiché il bordo esterno e il bordino delle fotocamere erano graffiati e e con delle ammaccature. Non ero interessata a vederlo accesso, è stato sufficiente vederlo esternamente. Ho preparato il pacco per il reso che è già stato effettuato. Adesso aspetto il rimborso.

Il telefono è arrivato in super anticipo e in condizioni perfette: è praticamente nuovo e perfettamente funzionante.L’unica pecca, se vogliamo chiamarla così, è lo stato batteria all’88%, sceso all’86% dopo due aggiornamenti di sistema.Ora come ora non costituisce un gran problema perché il telefono mi dura un giorno e mezzo con utilizzo intenso, ma avrei avvertito. Soprattutto perché lo stato è “come nuovo”.

Le téléphone soit disant reconditionné en excellent état s’est arrêté de fonctionner en moins d une journée après la livraison. Je ne peux même plus le rallumer ou le charger. Je dois donc le restituer . C’est la dernière fois que j’achète du reconditionné. Le service d’assistance de Amazon a été nul. Ils m’ont conseillé de contacter Apple pour qu’il le rallume !!! Apple ne prendra jamais en charge un phone reconditionné qui ne vient pas de chez eux mais d’un vendeur Amazon. N’importe quoi…J’ai du en acheter un neuf en urgence pour travailler  . Bref du temps perdu
"
3990,B08PCCQT8D,2,"
Il prodotto dicono che sia revisionato, speriamo sia così, perchè hanno dimenticato di pulirlo, infatti sono dovuto ricorrere al centro apple perchè si sentiva piano hanno dovuto pulire la parte audio adesso si sente bene, ma ho dovuto spendere altri 15 euro.Deluso
"
3991,B08PCCQT8D,2,"
Il prodotto si presenta apparentemente in buono stato, con un paio di  graffii sul display non evidentissimi, la batteria 86% e qui mi aspettavo un tantino in più avendo acquistato un prodotto con condizione eccellenti. La sorpresa è stata l’auricolare, che si sente davvero poco. Reso indispensabile!
"
3992,B08PCCQT8D,3,"
Vraiment la livraison reste à désirer certe c’est vendu sans boîte je suis dàccord mais mettre le téléphone juste en dessous d’un petit carton… et la batterie ouais c’est marche minimum 85% de l’état mais enfin je part du principe que le téléphone coûte comme meme 900€ le minimum serrai d’avoir une meilleure état des batterie

Le téléphone est arrivé très rapidement depuis l’Irlande, plusieurs jour avant le délai noté sur Amazon.Le téléphone est dans un état quasi neuf, après plusieurs jours d’utilisation, je constate que la batterie est très bien, tiens longtemps.J’ai eu un super chargeur, neuf, qui charge très rapidement.Je recommande ce vendeur pour le sérieux et l’efficacité.Merci

Prima esperienza con un rigenerato e avendo paura devo dire che è arrivato ben imballato con il caricatore pure, zero graffi immacolato e la cosa meravigliosa il 99% di batteria. Che dire esperienza ottima

Das Gerät war sauber ordentlich verpackt und in einem sehr guten Zustand. Aber derAkku war nur noch bei 90% deshalb Rücksendung.Habe über Warehouse ein IPhone 13 Pro Max bekommen welches wohl wirklich nur einmal ausgepackt wurde… Akku 100 % und Rind mehr fürs Geld… wenn man einmal soviel ausgibt…

Nel contesto lo smartphone e bellissimo , il problema è che se anche la batteria supera l’80% della sul stato , anche con un uso moderato non dura abbastanza . Il cell è in ottime condizioni peccato che per via della batteria si stia rivelando un acquisto pessimo
"
4025,B08PCCQT8D,5,"
Il prodotto è arrivato ben imballato in una scatola bianca con caricabatterie, cavo e telefono, visibilmente non ha nemmeno 1 graffio e aveva 90% di batteria, penso che sia un ottimo prodotto tenuto molto bene, consiglio vivamente di provare! ora non c'è altro che utilizzarlo e vedere se cambia qualcosa!

Mein alle erste Refurbished Produkt, hab mir unr meiner Frau einen iPhone 12 Pro Max geholt und wir waren wirklich begeistert. Ja die Verpackung ist nicht Original, interessiert uns aber nicht. Die beide Handys waren in Top Zustand, so zwei drei Gebrauchsspuren, aber fast unsichtbar. Meine Akku 100%, Akku von dem zweiten auf 95%. Die Handy benutzen wir jetzt seit 3 Wochen, echt Klasse, viel gespart für Handys die eig neu sind. Nächste Mal wieder Refurbished.

Il prodotto è perfetto, sia nelle condizioni che per l’imballaggio. Mi sarebbe piaciuto che avesse scritto il deterioramento in percentuale della batteria. Avevo un’iphone 11 che ho preso a giugno 2020 e l’ho venduto con 93% di batteria, questo l’ho preso apparentemente intatto ma che alla fine aveva il 90%. Si lo so, sono piccoli dettagli, forse anche superflui, ma io da venditore, lo avrei scritto.
"
4037,B08PCCQT8D,2,"
L’ayant acheté en mai 2022, je l’utilise depuis. Je peux donc vous donner mon avis.L’iPhone est beau, très peu de rayure. La batterie est correct. Mais il a très souvent dés moments de bug, ou l’écran ce met à ralentir lors de l’utilisation.

Unter generalüberholt mit der Beschreibung Zustand wie neu stelle ich mir etwas anderes vor,ich hatte ein neues Telefon gebraucht also hab ich es so hingenommen aber der Rahmen war leider schon sehr stark verkratzt ansonsten ist das Gerät entsprechend in einen akzeptablen Zustand.Ich denke diese Kratzer auf dem Rahmen sind aber nicht auf den Vorbesitzer zurückzuführen sondern eher auf die Reinigung des Geräts

IPhone 12 Promax annoncé en excellent état vendu  à 939€. Non seulement le téléphone est mal nettoyé mais il présente beaucoup de rayures. Et pour couronner le tout état de la batterie 89%. Après plusieurs tentatives avec Loop Mobile afin qu’ils fassent au moins un geste commercial car le téléphone ne correspond absolument pas à l’annonce, ils m’ont clairement fait comprendre qu’un geste commercial n’était même pas envisageable. J’avais demandé un retour que j’ai dû annulé car je n’ai aucun point DHL à proximité.J’avais confiance car c’est Amazon, mais je regrette vraiment mon achat. Loop mobile est carrément à fuir.

Arrivato anche prima del previsto, ero contentissimo della cosa. I problemi sono cominciati da quando l'ho attivato. In poche parole fintantochè non aggiornavo il sistema operativo staccava ed attacava la rete a suo piacimento, passando da nessun servizio a 4G piena in un secondo: questo problema causava una chiusura delle chiamate vocali dopo una media di 15-17 secondi.Eseguo l'aggiornamento del sistema e la rete cellulare praticamente morta e sepolta su nessun servizio. Avvio le pratiche per il reso ma ancora non ho ricevuto risposta dal venditore. Sono andato in un centro apple e mi hanno detto che nonostante il telefono sia internamente che esternamente sia privo di problematiche non si riescono a spiegare il perchè di questo problema.Spero di non dover ricorrere per vie legali dato che il cellulare l'ho acquistato con finanziamento.

I, like everyone else considering this product, was a bit wary of ordering a renewed phone instead of a new one, without seeing it first anyway. However, upon arrival & first look the phone is in impeccable condition! Everything seems to work as it should and the screen, edges, cameras etc are all free from any signs of use. I do however have two criticisms. The first, is that the battery health is only at 83%. My old iPhone is better than that at around 91/92! Still, it’s a second hand phone and it works. It’s really not the end of the world. It does it’s job and seems fine.My main issue was the delivery. When I heard that the phone was being sent through Evri my heart sank. I’ve lost so many parcels with them lately, this is actually the first parcel I’ve ever had arrive in one piece from them. The parcel was lost, then turned up again, then lost again, delayed, and finally arrived a week after it was due and then thrown over my 6ft garden fence. Luckily however, the phone is in one piece. I would just urge the seller to reconsider who they are using to send these devices.I would gladly buy another device from this company when the time comes, but not if Evri are taking anything to do with it.

My battery life was 85% , I thought it was too bad for having taken the excellent one... He thought he should specify more details, especially about battery life. :(
"
4134,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
I had been waiting iPhone 14 to be released before deciding which phone to go for. I would normally buy the latest phone unlocked and choose the best monthly rolling sim option. However, after weighing up the cost and functionality (iPhone 14 seemed a marginal functionality improvement at significantly increased cost), I came to the conclusion that a renewed iPhone 12 pro max offered much better value at around half the price. I choose the 'excellent condition' and have been very pleased with the result - especially as this is the first time I have taken this route. I have had the phone from Phones Direct for almost a month now and there have been no issues. There were no scratches/blemishes. The battery health was 87% and has remained so (the guarantee is >80%). I would have liked more (who wouldn't!) but it hasn't been an issue. Would definitely recommend

The screen freezes quite often and the battery life is a bit low but it looks absolutely fine. But mine didn’t come with a charger or a plug

I was wary about going for a refurbished phone after reading reviews about other so called market leading companies, however the feedback on this company made me take the plunge and I’m glad I did.  Quick delivery and the condition is as good as out of the box new but at massive discount, battery maximum capacity is 86% which is not an an issue.  The added bonus was the 12 month interest free payment option which was quick and easy to set up.  I kept my current unlimited data contract so it was a simple switch over of the SIM once the phones had synchronised with each other, it’s so easy these days!  I’ve estimated a saving over 2 years of around £700 compared with getting a refurbished phone of this specification from my service provider.  Bargain!

4139,B08PCDHMWQ,4,"
It's a great phone, like new and faultless performance. The battery life isn't wonderful but adequate. Nevertheless I'm really pleased with it, who needs iPhone 13 or 14?

4140,B08PCDHMWQ,1,"
I am absolutely shocked and appalled by the service and product that has been provided to me. I bought this phone as a Grade A iPhone 12 Pro Max, fully refurbished. I used this phone for around 2 months before it became completely unusable. I was using my phone as normal, when one day the screen just stopped working entirely. I thought maybe it was just a glitch and did everything that usually fixes the problem, restart, update etc. But nothing worked.I contacted Clover Mobiles and sent my phone off to be repaired; they refused to cooperate unless I payed a further £325 for a new screen, which was not even damaged at all. They didn't bother to look at the phone at all and decided the fault was due to a drop because there was a minor blemish on the corner of the phone. I decided to do some research myself and the component that processes touch on the phone, called a digitiser, cannot be broken simply from a drop on this model of phone. This proves Clover did nothing to look at the product or even try and find a solution.To make matters worse, I then spoke to an Amazon member of staff who informed me I can get a full refund for the entire amount of the product; I was extremely happy to hear this only for the horrendous staff at Clover to inform me that if I send the phone back they will just send it straight back to me. Amazon have let me down by saying I will be getting a full refund, only to be turned down by the seller. The phone even has a 1 year return policy if it doesn't work, which it doesn't!So after hearing this, I decided to look inside the phone to see if anything is loose or broken inside, which I could not break myself. And the inside of the phone is in such poor condition; there is soldering work that is so poorly done and the back of the screen, has a rip, I assume (like Clover Mobiles do), from a previous repair on the phone. Please see the images above and I implore you not to buy a product from these sellers, I do not want anyone else in the same situation.

Pretty sure the condition was listed as excellent but it did have some minor damage although that hasn’t impacted on it’s use
"
4142,B08PCDHMWQ,4,"
Battery only 85%I was expecting above 90% for excellent condition.
"
4143,B08PCDHMWQ,4,"
Phone has a fault when on calls the volume cuts down very low.  The company are happy to change it but unlike if you purchase direct from Apple they will not send you a replacement to transfer your pictures music etc over before having to send back.  Bare this in mind it could be worth paying the extra to Apple as in warranty service is the best ever.

Like new. 98% battery life. I ordered an Apple case. It is perfect.I just love it.

Good quality product

The physical condition was excellent but the battery health was only 82% which was a little disappointing for the premium price paid.

Straight out of the packaging this phone looks like it’s NEW, not a mark on it!Battery life shows at 100% 😲So far it seems to be working perfectly!Comes with 1 year warranty, too! 🧐Excellent value for money on this refurbished phone 😁Absolutely recommended!

GOOD

4151,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
Battery life is 87% but still ok for me. No single scratch on the phone. It looks good as new. Face recognition function perfectly. Will definitively recommend this phone to friends and family.
"
4152,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
The phone arrived and it’s absolutely stunning. No apparently marks whatsoever. Everything works perfectly. The battery life is at 88%. Looks like brand new if it had arrived in the original box.
"
4153,B08PCDHMWQ,4,"
You can never go wrong with an Apple item, but the seller is highly recommended

I was pleasantly surprised by this phone which was sent by Phones Direct Uk. I have been using it for almost a week now and have encountered absolutely no issues. Battery health was at 90% which I can’t really complain about. As for the actual body of the phone itself, it came in perfect condition, no marks or scratches at all on any part of the phone. Speakers work perfectly, as well as touchscreen, cameras, face ID, etc. I would definitely recommend buying refurbished through Amazon for a fair price, rather than the extortionate prices charged elsewhere. Less than £700 for what looks and acts like a brand new iPhone that is a fairly recent release. I know through Amazon Marketplace phones are sent from different individual companies so I cannot speak for all, but I am very happy with the phone I’ve received.

Not a mark on it for a renewed product.
"
4165,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
In a nutshell, the iPhone 12 pro max I bought is like a new phone. I never purchased a second-hand phone before, I have no regrets about buying this one I’m planning to buy another phone from the seller again. I hereby recommend this seller, I never believed that second-hand phones would be in that excellent condition.
"
4166,B08PCDHMWQ,3,"
Battery health is not good it’s just  83% it was bit disappointing. They should write’s exact battery health.
"
4167,B08PCDHMWQ,4,"
This is my first ever Iphone and so far I have been okay with it,I got a very good condition barely used phone and no damages or marks around it ( might got lucky)everything is currently working as it should, Yes it's high on price but still its Apple sadly
"
4168,B08PCDHMWQ,3,"
Unfortunately the phone sides were scratched deeply . The screen and back were clear though . It seemed that the previous owner had been a bit careless .The scratches were deep enough to be felt and the metallic rim felt as though it was rusted ??I used first class mail to return the iPhone , cost me 5.5 £ , the seller only refunded the phone cost even though it was clearly mentioned that the return cost will be refunded as well .The phone had not been cleaned either .Though battery was working as advertised and phone didn't have any other obvious defect .Over all a poor experience on Amazon and by the seller .Will stick to first hand goods only in future .
"
4169,B08PCDHMWQ,4,"
Very disappointed with this phone And seller I have been through customer live chat I get nowhere avoid at all costs

For so many purpose we used phone for.
"

It’s great value for money
"
4172,B08PCDHMWQ,4,"
I actually didn’t realise the phone was a used renewed phone when I bought it, thought it was brand new but either way it came in immaculate condition with no visible signs of use. Hopefully there aren’t any problems as time goes by! But for now very good
"
4173,B08PCDHMWQ,2,"
I'm going to keep it short and sweet - Ordered three phones from three different vendors, each supposedly in ""excellent condition"". First one had a severely deteriorated battery apparently, second had a bizarre screen fitted that was definitely not Apple. Maybe it was pear. Third has chips all around the bezel and the PVC coating has worn away. Note: the last two also had battery lives of 80% and 83%. If this is excellent quality, what do you get with ""acceptable"" - The bezel alone?
"
4174,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
Face recognition is so easy and much better security than I’ve had previously. I’ve never been an iPhone fan but my husband bought me this and I must admit I love everything about it.
"
4175,B08PCDHMWQ,4,"
a few small insignificant scratches, great quality for price pleased with it and do recommend.

4177,B08PCDHMWQ,3,"
First time buying a refurbished phone. Look like a new!! Ordered yesterday received today. Easy set up. Can’t wait to write this review.  Will keep you updated after a few months’ use.After a month, not sure about the screen. It’s dull although brightness is adjust to 90%.Sometimes the screen keeps flipping when I press my finger on certain app. Don’t know why.
"
4178,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
I've had this product for one week now. Battery came at 89% after a few days usage it went to 88%. But, it still lasts me all day! It's a big change for me as I've had an iPhone 8 Plus over the past couple of years. I was quite skeptical about ordering this product but I took the risk and I'm happy so far! :) Really wanted to buy a iPhone 12 Pro Max outright at a good price and it's great that it can be returned within a year!They delivered it within a day. No major scratches on the phone, it was just dirty around the camera lenses and in the mute button. Everything else is brilliant so far, the back and front camera quality is amazing! I have no other complaints, will update this review over the coming months.
"
4179,B08PCDHMWQ,4,"
I turned it on and it worked like an iphone so we chilling
"
4180,B08PCDHMWQ,4,"
Upgraded from 11 pro. Generally I knew what to expect. The only issue was a little scratch on the screen but fine otherwise. Came in MusicMagpie box though.

4181,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
My wife has serious phone envy when she sees the photos I take on my iPhone 12 Pro Max and the way it syncs with my iPad. So, being the loving husband I decided to buy her the same phone, but refurbished to save hundreds of pounds on what I paid for mine new about 9 months ago.I was almost put off by the reviews on here, but decided to buy as I knew I could return the phone if it was damaged in any way.I made the right decision and my wife is delighted. The phone looks like it is new and has 100% battery life. Mega brownie points for me.And the 1 year warranty is fantastic.We just have to see now who can take the best photos with our top of the range iPhones.
"
4182,B08PCDHMWQ,4,"
Nice

4183,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
I was worried about spending £600 on a reconditioned phone, but after reading reviews on the seller went for a iphone 12 max pro.Phoned arrived in good time, package was basic, with charging cable, plug, and card removal pin.Phone is spotless, looks brand new with no visible marks at all... screen is also totally mark free, all systems working fine, and the battery is saying its at 98% chargeable to its max level. All in all very happy with my purchase.
"
4184,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
When I received my new phone, they included a charger which apple don’t do, a 100 percent battery life. It was worth buying.
"
4185,B08PCDHMWQ,4,"
88% battery capacity when it arrived, surely for a refurbed unit put a new one in.
"
4186,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
I never write reviews but..... Brand new phone, not even a single scratch. Very pleased with this product. I would never buy an iphone from an Apple Store again! Good for your pocked and for the planer as well! Fast delivery comes with the essentials. I'll get back with a battery life review after 6 months. If you still wonder whether to buy it or now, go ahead, you won't regret it!
"
4187,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
Amazing phone at a great price… immaculate condition and battery health was 95%
"
4188,B08PCDHMWQ,4,"
I just got this phone delivered to me yesterday.For the money i spent i can say it is in a decent shape.It has some scratches on the screen which are pretty visible, on the sides as well.Overall i am quite happy with the product, it came with 96% battery so i dunno.Delivery was ok too.
"
4189,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
So far so good “….
"
4190,B08PCDHMWQ,2,"
Battery was 88 % this is 3 years worth of useI recommend battery replacement , i contacted the seller and they were happy if its over 80%I wish to be considered for a replacement with a better battery health same condition though
"
4191,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
So the Iphone came the next day i made the purchase.90% Battery Life, honestly no scratch and including things on the photo (charger plug, cable and a voucher… also the phone). If this is a second hand phone, shows then that previous owner used to keep it with case and protector (same as me) so happy for the purchase.I would have preferred signed delivery from Royal Mail maybe (as it is an expensive parcel), but if you organize well yourself, you can pick it up quickly.Hope this helps
"
4192,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
I’ve been using the phone for a few weeks now, and it is much better than I thought it would be. I upgraded from the 7 plus, and was very pleased at the quality of the phone when it arrived. There were no scratches, and the battery was 92% of a brand new phone (the description said it would guarantee 80%). I definitely saved a lot of money!
"
4193,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
I am really impressed with the value of the phone I received! I was a bit sceptical at first knowing that it was a refurbished iPhone however once I received my package I was overjoyed with what I had been given! The phone looks almost brand new! No scratches on the screen, the sides are in perfect condition and the back is immaculate!! The battery health on the phone is 92% which ofc isn’t perfect but the phone still last well over a day, and I’d say I use my phone moderately to high amount!!I got the iPhone 12 Pro Max Blue 256GB two days after I ordered it! Even though it said it would take about a week!10/10 for this! Very impressed!
"
4194,B08PCDHMWQ,3,"
Cannot fault the quality of the device itself, looks like new! However, the phone comes with a Lighting>USBC cable but a USB A adapter, so that’s not very helpful, could be wrong? The other thing was that the phone came with 0% battery so couldn’t turn it on for a while and I thought something was wrong with it at first as I had it on charge for 30 minutes before it seemed to come into life?!Lastly, delivery - you cannot choose Amazon locker and DPD just left it on the floor outside the house which is pretty crazy considering the cost of it
"
4195,B08PCDHMWQ,4,"
This good for value
"
4196,B08PCDHMWQ,2,"
The phone is not that good bro and I payed 630 the battery life is not good
"
4197,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
The phone looked absolutely mint basically brand new can’t complain really really happy with my purchase as a 1 year warranty with Amazon renewal great scheme would 100% buy from this device and the company who sold it again
"
4198,B08PCDHMWQ,2,"
side of the furniture with a lot of scratches
"
4199,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
I Was dubious about spending £700 on a used phone but after receiving this flagship iPhone, I couldn’t be happier. Face recognition works perfectly, battery health is 100…… yes 100%, and the phone itself is near perfect. One tiny scratch on the top edge. That’s it, apart from an even smaller scratch on the screen that I’ll never even notice. I only saw it while I was scrutinising the whole phone. In addition, you get an Apple adapter (unlike with a new iPhone).Amazon renewed from now on for my next iPhone.
"
4200,B08PCDHMWQ,3,"
Unfortunately the phone was received with a crack in the corner on the screen. Easy to miss unless viewed at an angle in daylight. We all make mistakes. Apart from that excellent service and fantastic iPhone.
"
4201,B08PCDHMWQ,2,"
Received phone with only 82% capacity, very disappointed.
"
4202,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
There’s always a little bit of trepidation when buyingSomething second hand but this time very happy with the phone . No marks scratches whatsoever just looks like new with a massive saving.
"
4203,B08PCDHMWQ,2,"
Having ordered several renewed phones from Amazon. I might give it a miss from now on as suppliers are now supplying phones with the battery at 81% health. My older iPhone 8+ has a better life than that and this newer model was purchased to replace it. But as the Amazon rule is 80% some suppliers are using this to their advantage to get shot of their stock.  The phone was quite dirty when delivered but no visible scratches which was probably the only bonus.  If you up for a game of chance go for it but ideally I’ll go somewhere where I can visibly see the product before purchase.
"
4204,B08PCDHMWQ,4,"
I do like this phone and the great price I paid for it. However it’s too big and starts to hurt your hand after a while and my hands are bigger than the phone!
"
4205,B08PCDHMWQ,3,"
Everything is okay apart from screen scratch which is quite noticeable. it might not affect your use but still there.
"
4206,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
I absolutely love my iPhone 12 Pro Max.The battery life is not as much good but overall fine . Fantastic camera.
"
4207,B08PCDHMWQ,1,"
Bought IPhone 12 Pro Max as a present for a relative. Supposedly grade A condition, come with large very noticeable scratch. Tried using portrait mode on camera which would go completely black and not work and then also not let any other option be selected on the camera to take a normal photograph. When receiving a call the phone would completely freeze and not work to the point of having to reset the whole phone and set up as new. Thought with being a grade A it would be fine to buy refurbished but I would 100% advise anyone to not buy second hand or from this seller.
"
4208,B08PCDHMWQ,2,"
Came with a few scratches but most thing I don’t like how it’s screen has been polished poorly to get rid of its scratches not the best pleased but have it under a screen protector so don’t see it but you’d think for the amount of money you spend you’d think it would be better musicmagpie I wouldn’t rate 👎🏻
"
4209,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
Face recognition seems to be working as it should be, battery life was 100% when I bought the first time and now is 97% I haven’t had any issues with this one whatsoever and also great price, I would definitely recommend this one phone.
"
4210,B08PCDHMWQ,1,"
IPhone kept freezing when coming out standby / sleep had to return phone, dealer delayed refund after 3 weeks of waiting had to get Amazon involved to sort out refund

4213,B08PCDHMWQ,1,"
Face ID didn't work on the iPhone, I received today. Even though it was described as in excellent condition... Can't trust the seller:( It is a lottery whether you'll get a good one or with an issue like in my case.
"
4214,B08PCDHMWQ,1,"
Camera had many faults including a black dot on screen when using the 2.5x lens. This would appear in every photo taken using that lens. Also, reflections would occur on images as seen in image two with the cat. This is not acceptable on a £660 phone. The battery capacity was at 89% when received and although this is not the worst it could be (as stated they sell phones with up to 80% capacity), this combined with the faulty camera really made the phone not acceptable. I would strongly recommend not buying this product.
"
4215,B08PCDHMWQ,3,"
This mobile has heating problem and battery life is not so good.
"
4216,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"

4217,B08PCDHMWQ,1,"
Bought this phone for myself battery life was 82% only lasted 3 hours on a full charge so had to replace at my own cost but the company did pay 50% towards a new battery the phone was bought as excellent condition the screen was flawless but the frame had deep scratches on the screen surrounding the Main camera on the rear off the phone the 2.5mm makes wired noises when trying to focus and sometimes bouncing around on screen all round the phone is in bad condition for the money go somewhere else
"
4218,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
Phone may not have come with it's original box or charger, but I did get an original Apple cable and the charger that came with came with dual USB-A ports, which is even more useful.
"
4219,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
If you have any doubts, kill them immediately. Only thing that was disappointing is that the phone came with the old USB to lightning cable as opposed to the new USB C to lightning cable. But besides that, this thing is an amazing buy for the price
"
4220,B08PCDHMWQ,1,"
Very disappointed in the condition of the phone I received! I paid for excellent condition, however that wasn’t what I received!The camera lenses, all 3 lenses were chipped around the edges! The gold casing around the phone was all scratched.I didn’t even turn the phone on, as wasn’t accepting it in the condition I received it.Very disappointing indeed!
"
4221,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
I will never buy a new iPhone again bought the 12pro max renewed it is in as new condition not a single fingerprint never mind a scratch on the phone, battery health at 95% which is as close to perfect as I could expect, and only £650 really it is 5* if you need a phone use this service
"
4222,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
99% battery and not a mark on it and virtually half price! Pained me to have to buy one as I was robbed but really pleased with value for money and will probably never buy new again!
"
4223,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
Was slightly worried about some negative reviews and risks with getting a refurbished iPhone, but it turned out great. Only negatives are the fact it doesn't come in the original box, and the cable is USB-B. The device itself is absolutely spotless, not a single scratch detected after I looked closely for a good 10mn.The battery shows 99% so no complaint here either. Really good experience overall, would definitely recommend.
"
4224,B08PCDHMWQ,1,"
Disappointed as it does not come with a basic charger, so what's the point and you cannot check the item as it needs charging, typical, so first impressions are very very poor
"
4225,B08PCDHMWQ,4,"
Meet my expectations
"
4226,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
The phone arrived earlier than expected. Except there is couple of minor scratches (hardly visible) on the screen otherwise looks brand new. I’m very happy with my purchase
"
4227,B08PCDHMWQ,2,"
Not to the high standard of ‘renewed’ from Amazon that I have been used to in the past.The screen is badly scratched, the bezel edge around the screen is chipped and the ear speaker is not working when making or receiving calls.A far cry from the “This product works and looks like new.” and the “Excellent condition (Refurbished)” write up.
"
4228,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
Great product and looked new.
"
4229,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
The phone is in excellent condition working perfectly no scratches battery is really good
"
4230,B08PCDHMWQ,1,"
I am giving it 1 star because it is a really terrible experience for me in my purchase life. I got a not working cable and I requested it again and again but the seller did not solve it. The phone works but it is missing and not functional phone without the original cable. Please do not buy musigmapie on Amazon.
"
4231,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
Neat and clean

Well everything other than the screen was as described, apple notified me straight away that the screen/display was FAKE therefore had no choice but to return.

"
4237,B08PCDHMWQ,1,"
A lot of scratches on board, is not excellent condition.
"
4238,B08PCDHMWQ,1,"
I thought buying a refurbished was not only good for recycling/planet but also getting an up to date phone cheaper seeing as most phones have built in obsolescence now.  Unfortunately the phone I received, although in excellent condition, produced exceptional heat during my use, so much so, I turned it off as I was concerned about it exploding and further consideration that it would catch fire during the night etc.  i contacted the company and was asking did I use it while it was being charged, I queried this as with my previous iPhone I used while being charged without problems.  I was happy to have it repaired providing the battery, if that was the problem, or other parts were Apple accredited but was advised that the parts were not Apple but other manufacturers replication which concerned me once more, I then requested a refund.  So I would suggest to anyone, be careful when purchasing a refurbished phone or just buy a cheaper model if your budget restraint is a consideration.
"
4239,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
I was initially concerned about buying a renewed but after receiving it today I could not be happier. Phone is in perfect condition, came with a screen protector already installed. Battery percentage at 92%. Very pleased with the purchase

Very happy with phone. Looks brand-new. Battery life fine. Fast delivery.
"
4244,B08PCDHMWQ,2,"
The product description which states: ""No signs of cosmetic damage (scratches, dents, etc.) will be visible when the product is held 30 centimeters away"" turned out be a complete lie. The phone came with 2 very noticeable scratches on its screen, which more on its sides. There is also chip damage on its upper corner. These are all viseable from a metre away in a normally lit room, which become very obvious outside and under room lights. The delivery was fast and reliable so can't fault them there.
"

The phone was perfect from outside but when it comes to charging it took me 5.30 to charge my phone up to 80% and it was getting very hot while charging my dad has the phone but he didnt had these issues

Battery TERRIBLE! Lasts 5 hours max! Airdrop doesn’t work, voice memo doesn’t work! Seller won’t send a replacement until they have received it back or won’t do a door swap! So have to get another phone before I send it back! It was a birthday present to my self so it’s very disappointing!

I would not advise anyone one to get this product, better to save money and buy a new iphone, or better still, getting one on a contract would sufficeThe device quality is absolutely poor, from the camera quality down to the battery. Quality is not as described by the seller, just deceit. I have requested for a refund and hope I would get back my moneyI have purchased some supposed quality products that turned out defective  however, this is worst, I have never regretted purchasing an item of this nature before..

To begin, the package arrived three days earlier than expected, which was surprising; the phone itself was not in a box upon arrival, which was worrying, although the phone was covered in a thick layer of plastic wrap.  I did see some minor scratches on the screen, but they were not noticeable unless you looked closely.  Otherwise, there was no other damage.  The phone was a bit dirty but was easily cleaned.After using the phone for about a month, I realized this was an excellent upgrade.  Yes, it was expensive, although I moved up from an iPhone 8, so the pros outweighed the cons.  What are the cons?  The maximum hold on the battery is 91%, not fantastic, but it is way better than my iPhone 8; it outlives that phone by a mile.  It is a heavier phone, and I wasn't expecting the weight of it.  I can hold it with one hand and still type with the holding hand, although the weight on my pinky as I hold it up does hurt after a while.  The price was quite a bit for a refurbished phone, in my opinion, but as an upgrade, the phone is impressive.For Pros, this phone has a different layout; it took me a mere week to get over the fact there is no button; remember, I upgraded from an iPhone 8, where the button still exists.  Honestly, I prefer face recognition; it is just way more easier to do anything, rather than failing the touch ID over and over.  Again as the battery was also a con, it is also a pro; it lasts way longer than my iPhone 8 ever did.  Something I shouldn't have to go over, but the camera is divine; it is so surreal to me.  I love it.  As for calling people and so on, everyone can hear me very clearly, and I hear them better.  Lastly, the speakers are excellent; I feel like it is surround sound almost, compared to my iPhone 8, this iPhone 12 Pro Max is just outstanding.Overall, this was a wonderful upgrade, although it did have some cons as not everything is perfect.

Relieved when my phone arrived in a really lovely environmentally friendly box. No damage or scratches to be seen on the phone at all, looks brand new, battery life 90%. Was ready to be set up with about 10% charge. Came with a plug and charging cable. As you can see on the photo it can be registered for a one year warranty. Bought through UR, delivered by Royal Mail 48hrs after ordering. Will defos come back to them in a few years to upgrade once more. Highly recommend.

The product was delivered on time and in great condition. After thinking about whether I should get a 12 pro max or 13, I'm glad I got this. I'm still getting use to the very big screen but it's also another reason I like the phone—definitely, value for money.Just a slight thing tho, the packaging could have been better as it came in a cardboard box with very little protection.

This is my first time of buying a renewed iPhone from Amazon. The product is in excellent condition with a battery level of 85%. The phone is very clean with no mark at all. It is working perfectly well. It is a good way to save money on a latest phone.The price is very competitive and delivery was super fast. Excellent customer service from Amazon as usual.I strongly recommend renewed phones, there is no much difference with brand new and you will save a lot of money.The guarantee is One year as well, and mine came with Apple care till 12 November 2022.

Cannot fault this phone! I was slightly sceptical to buy a refurbished phone but I did not need to worry, Mazuma (provider might be different for others) really pulled through! Perfect condition and 100% battery health, it was already charged so I could use it straight away. Definitely worth getting a more reasonably priced iPhone 12 Pro Max than the iPhone Pro Max 13, which only has a couple more features that I wouldn't even care about. Thanks again Mazuma!

4310,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
It’s a very good and just the right size too. The only problem is that the battery health being a bit low at 91% but that not a big deal to me as it still lasts me the entire day without charging it.

Great phone so far, always wary with refurb but with Amazon 1 year hopefully cross fingers will be ok, advert states a plug included they seem to disagree, wrong lead sent but am using my original lead, definitely worth upgrade from XR to 12 Pro Max. Disappointed with 82% battery others state they had 95% at least may have to replace battery sooner than I thought
"
4314,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
The phone works perfectly well. It is exactly what was described in the advert. Battery life 87%. I have no reason to complain.

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 £740 is a big old chunk of cash to spend when some of the reviews showed trashed phones and talked of difficult returns. I had decided to buy a new iPhone at £1000 instead because of the bad reviews but there was a 2 month wait and I’m inpatient so rolled the dice. As you can see in the video of me opening the package the 12 ProMax I got was pristine, battery health was 99% and I’m delighted, it comes well packaged in a box similar to the Apple design with a generic lightning charger and sim pin. I think it would be useful if the condition of the actual phone you’ll get was somewhere in the description rather than generic text, I know three conditions are described in one of the pictures but I could not find these referenced in the description.
"
4316,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
I was slightly worried after ordering this product as I’ve started to read through the reviews of convincing lack of quality from this company but nothing could be further from the truth.I have ordered the refurbished phone (close to new), I have done every check on the phone that I possibly could and I’ve concluded that the product I received was worth every penny. If you’re the type to care about the smallest scuff on your phone then please just buy a brand new phone. My screen has a couple scratches but it was not noticeable unless you look through a microcope. They have not cut any corners, full OLED screen, camera is crisp, touch screen has no faults.The only negative that alot of people seem to share is the battery percentage but that’s a loss I can take for the price. Anyways worry not, you’re safe with this purchase. :)Edit: wow, didn't expect that many people to find this review helpful. glad i could help.

The phone's physical condition is good, with no scratches; it looks like a brand-new iPhone.  I liked the phone's colour (pacific blue), and the battery health was around 88% when it arrived. The camera is working fine. After using it for more than a month now, I am satisfied with my purchase. Worth investing. No screen freeze or other issues.

Really good quality, no scratches or scuffs at all. The only problem is the battery health. It’s not too bad but 86% isn’t the best considering it’s £700. Except for that it’s great!

First time buying a renewed phone but my iPhone X was so painful to use + Face ID didn’t work and front camera didn’t work from where I smashed the screen, it was like that for 2 years and I had finally had enough, looked around for a while, compared specs of 12, 13, 14 pro max, not much in it compared with the price scaling, looked on back market and almost ordered from there, checked trust pilot and there were a lot of bad reviews, checked on here, found this, ordered it, it came, barely a thing wrong with it, the tiniest mark on the screen which I can’t even see with a screen protector on, cameras work perfectly, Face ID works perfectly, battery life is impeccable, this was such a good deal and I feel so lucky to have come across it, it sounds dumb but it feels so good to have a newer faster phone like I don’t know, it just feels great, I love it, will definitely be doing this again in years time or however long I can make this phone last for! 😁 100% recommend!

La confezione è spartanissima, il prodotto è  giunto in buone condizioni,  ed anche se la scocca i gusci ed il vetro sono perfetti, la batterie era all85% anche se comprato  come “perfette condizioni” inavvertitamente ci è caduta un po di acqua sopra e per 15 minuti anche se spento e perfettamente asciugato alla riaccensione l'alto parlante ed il microfono gracchiavano.Quindi in ansia per lIP 68 che credo non vi sia.

Il telefono è perfetto. Le condizioni erano pari al nuovo e così infatti è risultato. Sembra quasi che nessuno l’abbia mai utilizzato. Nessun graffio e nessuna ammaccatura. Se si vuole acquistare un ricondizionato è bene stare attenti al grado riguardanti le condizioni. Avendo acquistato diversi ricondizionati non mi sono trovata mai male nel scegliere quelli in condizioni eccellenti o pari al nuovo. Unica piccola pecca può essere la batteria che si presenta all’89%. Ma avendo già avuto una batteria simile posso dire che non crea nessun tipo di problema.Oltre al telefono nella scatola era presente il cavetto con il caricatore originali e con la pellicola di imballaggio della Apple. Quindi mai usati.Mi sento di consigliare vivamente questo venditore.
"
4331,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
Sono rimasto veramente sorpreso. Il telefono è arrivato con 1 giorno di anticipo. Display come nuovo, nemmeno un micro graffio. Parte posteriore del telefono come nuova. L'unica pecca è il bordo con 6 micro ammaccature, ma anche con una cover trasparente non si vedono. Stato della batteria al 96%. Il telefono funziona perfettamente. Rapporto qualità prezzo super bilanciato. 5 stelle meritatissime!

Edit: acquistato in grafite per mio marito, arrivato iPhone altrettanto perfetto al mio, con batteria altrettanto al 91%. Immacolato letteralmente pari al nuovo👏🏼Per ora - non sapessi di averlo pagato quel che ho pagato e non ci fosse la batteria al 91% (su tel di due anni), penserei che si tratti di un iPhone nuovo di pacco😱Esteticamente immacolato. Non un segno graffio o ombra👍🏼Al momento, perfettamente funzionante👍🏼Vedremo nel tempo…ma a prescindere vado tranquilla grazie alla garanzia Amazon Renewed che consente reso e rimborso per un anno intero 🙏🏼 grazie Amazon e grazie al venditore che me lo ha spedito con velocità da teletrasporto - quando in teoria arrivava 10gg dopo. Eccezionale.

Esperienza al di sopra delle aspettative. Il prodotto è arrivato in due giorni lavorativi, molto meglio del previsto, in un imballo corretto.

Es el tercer móvil que compro de Amazon, y el único que me llega con buena salud de batería . A la tercera va la vencida !!! . La verdad es que estoy encantada con el, es precioso, me vino con un par de rasguñitos pequeños en el lateral, pero nada que una funda no tape, la salud de la batería me llego con un 97%. Un chollo. Estoy contentísima. Lo que pasa es que puedes tener la suerte de que te llegue con un 80% de salud(como mi anterior iPhone XS Max) o con un 97% de salud(como este mismo)Pero a mi me parece genial económicamente esta opción de poder comprar reacondicionados. Solo que como dije antes, puede salirte bien, o no. En caso de no salirte bien la batería, devuelves y pruebas otro.

avendo letto altre recensioni di resi per danneggiamento allo schermo o al corpo del telefono ero titubante, ma il telefono è arrivato con un giorno di anticipo ed era perfetto.zero segni o graffi, come da immagini allegate.nella scatola trovate anche il caricatore, il cavo usb c/lightning e la graffetta a spillo per estrarre/inserire la sim (che erano un po’ buttati lì a caso, ma per un ricondizionato non originale non mi formalizzerei).consiglio l’acquisto, anche perché garantito dal reso Amazon per un anno (motivo principale che mi ha spinto all’acquisto nonostante i dubbi di cui sopra).UPDATE: a distanza di un paio di giorni mi sono resa conto che la batteria si scaricava in modo strano, e andando a cercare tra le impostazioni ho visto che il suo stato di salute era di una carica massima dell'87%. ho fatto il reso e sto attendendo il rimborso

Venia con una de las cámaras un poco rallada(que no influye para nada). La única pega que le podría poner es que me vino con un 82% de salud de batería, pero igualmente aguanta un día entero sin problemas ni fallos, al precio que lo he comprado es normal que tenga algún detallito. Una batería nueva tampoco vale mucho, llevo un mes de uso y va perfecto y tiene garantía.

Je ne prends d'habitude pas le temps d'écrire un commentaire mais je ferai une exception cette fois ci. Quelle bonne surprise. Comme beaucoup je me méfiais d'une mauvaise surprise en faisant le choix du reconditionné et bien je ne me suis trompé. J'ai acheté auprès de ce vendeur un iPhone 12 Pro Max en excellent etat et le moins que l'on puisse dire c'est que la promesse est tenue. Etat impeccable, aucune rayure, livraison en avance.

Excellent, j’ai pris le tel dans un état acceptable.Je suis satisfait par l’état du téléphone. (3 marques sur l’écran qui ne se voit plus vraiment quand l’écran est allumé)Rapide et communication top de la part du vendeurUne amélioration à apporter pour le futur. Des photos précise et la description des défauts serait un plus je pense.Aujourd’hui c’est un peu le loto, toi et ta chance ! 😃

La batteria ha una percentuale di usura altissima. Considerando che ho scelto la categoria con il costo più alto per avere il massimo.All’interno non c’è il cavo originale ma cinesataLo scatolone non è originale.

Assolutamente prodotto perfetto come da descrizione e funzionante al top !!! Come averlo acquistato nuovo in negozio. Scatola non originale ma se non si fa la raccolta delle scatole dei propri telefono direi che è proprio l’ultima cosa alla quale guardare .

Le téléphone est intact, au défaut sur l'écran, l'arrière est nickel juste une minuscule égratignures au niveau d'une touche sur le côté mais faut vraiment regarder pour le voir et batterie à 97% . Franchement nous on on est super content, je vous recommande ce vendeur. Après ça fait seulement 3 jrs qu'on la donc j'espère qu'il n'y aura pas de soucis à la longue. Je sais pas si il y a une garantie sur l'article.

Il dispositivo è arrivato in condizioni estetiche perfette (si nota che è stata sostituita la parte posteriore) nessun graffio o segno di usura. Batteria al 94% (ben oltre le aspettative). Ho avuto un piccolo problema con lo speaker superiore risolto con un po’ di pulizia. Per ogni dubbio o informazione il venditore ha risposto sempre in maniera tempestiva.

Producto 100 % original. Apple me llegó una caja que no es la original porque es un móvil reconstruido. Lo que no me gusta es que me vino con de Salud 83 % de batería ya que la batería la recomienda Apple para cambiarla a los 80 % de salud y se me descarga un poco rápido, pero el móvil me va súper bien. Estoy probando y ya te daré más detalles a lo largo del uso

Prodotto consegnato con carica batterie sbagliato infatti non è il 20 watt e non ha il cavetto appropriato poi in considerazione che ho acquistato un rigenerato in condizioni eccellenti non avrebbe dovuto riportare il vetro graffiato in ben tre punti. Come rigenerato è da considerare in buone condizioni ma non eccellenti. Batteria con resa all’83 per cento.

Lieferung heute erhalten. Laut Beschreibung sollte es sich um ein generalüberholtes IPhone 12 Pro Max handeln, welches aussieht wie neu.Auf dem Display waren keine Macken, dafür umso mehr am Rahmen.An alle Ecken und Kanten befinden sich Kratzer und Riefen.Aber dann sowas als „Wie neu“ zu deklarieren ist eine Frechheit bei fast 800€. Karton war auch nicht original.Kabel und Ladegerät lagen separat in der Kiste. Billigste Ware (no Name)Akku Zustand bei 80% d.h. Fast 2 Jahre gebraucht.

4407,B08PCDHMWQ,5,"
The store I got my phone from is called Flip4shop. I’m very happy with the purchase. The condition was listed as “acceptable” There are some scratches on the screen at a few locations, and some scratches at the lightning port, but I really don’t care. My old phone was way more scratched up than this. Just slap on a glass screen protector and a case and it’s good as new. The battery lifespan is at 98%. What’s important to me are that no glass is cracked and a good battery. I’d hazard a guess this was a display model at a phone shop and have been played around by customers. For the price it was very value for money and I would not hesitate to buy my next phone here with them again.

Petit bémol 92% de batterie mais bon à ce prix je suis satisfaite pour le moment . Téléphone acheté hier à 13h30 reçu le lendemain à la même heure !! Quelle rapidité !!

Pensavo che un ricondizionato avesse la batteria al 100%. Questo articolo Iphone 12 pro max ha invece una batteria già usata, per la precisione ha l'86% di capacità (allego foto). Dopo 2 giorni ho notato anche alcuni puntini bianchi, simili a piccole ammaccature sulla parte laterale  (superficiali) dell'Iphone che erano stati oscurati sicuramente con qualche pennarello, e dopo qualche ora di uso tornati alla luce.Ne usufruisco qualche altro giorno e capisco se chiedere il reso.

Ho acquistato un iPhone 12 pro Max in condizioni eccellenti quindi al prezzo più alto. È arrivato in tempi brevi ma appena aperto il pacco mi ritrovo un telefono che non è in condizioni eccellenti come da descrizione poiché il bordo esterno e il bordino delle fotocamere erano graffiati e e con delle ammaccature. Non ero interessata a vederlo accesso, è stato sufficiente vederlo esternamente. Ho preparato il pacco per il reso che è già stato effettuato. Adesso aspetto il rimborso.

Il telefono è arrivato in super anticipo e in condizioni perfette: è praticamente nuovo e perfettamente funzionante.L’unica pecca, se vogliamo chiamarla così, è lo stato batteria all’88%, sceso all’86% dopo due aggiornamenti di sistema.Ora come ora non costituisce un gran problema perché il telefono mi dura un giorno e mezzo con utilizzo intenso, ma avrei avvertito. Soprattutto perché lo stato è “come nuovo”.

Le téléphone soit disant reconditionné en excellent état s’est arrêté de fonctionner en moins d une journée après la livraison. Je ne peux même plus le rallumer ou le charger. Je dois donc le restituer . C’est la dernière fois que j’achète du reconditionné. Le service d’assistance de Amazon a été nul. Ils m’ont conseillé de contacter Apple pour qu’il le rallume !!! Apple ne prendra jamais en charge un phone reconditionné qui ne vient pas de chez eux mais d’un vendeur Amazon. N’importe quoi…J’ai du en acheter un neuf en urgence pour travailler  . Bref du temps perdu
"
4429,B08PCDHMWQ,2,"
Il prodotto dicono che sia revisionato, speriamo sia così, perchè hanno dimenticato di pulirlo, infatti sono dovuto ricorrere al centro apple perchè si sentiva piano hanno dovuto pulire la parte audio adesso si sente bene, ma ho dovuto spendere altri 15 euro.Deluso
"
4430,B08PCDHMWQ,2,"
Il prodotto si presenta apparentemente in buono stato, con un paio di  graffii sul display non evidentissimi, la batteria 86% e qui mi aspettavo un tantino in più avendo acquistato un prodotto con condizione eccellenti. La sorpresa è stata l’auricolare, che si sente davvero poco. Reso indispensabile!

Vraiment la livraison reste à désirer certe c’est vendu sans boîte je suis dàccord mais mettre le téléphone juste en dessous d’un petit carton… et la batterie ouais c’est marche minimum 85% de l’état mais enfin je part du principe que le téléphone coûte comme meme 900€ le minimum serrai d’avoir une meilleure état des batterie

Mein alle erste Refurbished Produkt, hab mir unr meiner Frau einen iPhone 12 Pro Max geholt und wir waren wirklich begeistert. Ja die Verpackung ist nicht Original, interessiert uns aber nicht. Die beide Handys waren in Top Zustand, so zwei drei Gebrauchsspuren, aber fast unsichtbar. Meine Akku 100%, Akku von dem zweiten auf 95%. Die Handy benutzen wir jetzt seit 3 Wochen, echt Klasse, viel gespart für Handys die eig neu sind. Nächste Mal wieder Refurbished.

Il prodotto è perfetto, sia nelle condizioni che per l’imballaggio. Mi sarebbe piaciuto che avesse scritto il deterioramento in percentuale della batteria. Avevo un’iphone 11 che ho preso a giugno 2020 e l’ho venduto con 93% di batteria, questo l’ho preso apparentemente intatto ma che alla fine aveva il 90%. Si lo so, sono piccoli dettagli, forse anche superflui, ma io da venditore, lo avrei scritto.

Mais j espère de tout cœur que hexamobile prendra des mesures pour cet incident.Plus jamais je commande à hexamobile. Et je vais être plus vigilante et ne commander que quand je vois expédié par AMAZON .Merci au service après vente d Amazon  pour l efficacité

Buen embalaje, el dispositivo parece nuevo. Sin rasguños, abolladuras ni nada. Parece que todo son piezas originales.Viene en un bonito embalaje ecológico. En general, ahorré 450 euros comprando reacondicionados en lugar de nuevos. Bueno para mí y para el planeta.

Il telefono esteticamente è perfetto, non ha alcun segno di usura, la batteria purtroppo è già all’87% speravo meglio ma del resto è un prodotto usato. Dura comunque abbondantemente più di una giornata con 6 ore di schermo e più, ad oggi è il miglior modo per prendere un iphone

IPhone 12 Promax annoncé en excellent état vendu  à 939€. Non seulement le téléphone est mal nettoyé mais il présente beaucoup de rayures. Et pour couronner le tout état de la batterie 89%. Après plusieurs tentatives avec Loop Mobile afin qu’ils fassent au moins un geste commercial car le téléphone ne correspond absolument pas à l’annonce, ils m’ont clairement fait comprendre qu’un geste commercial n’était même pas envisageable. J’avais demandé un retour que j’ai dû annulé car je n’ai aucun point DHL à proximité.J’avais confiance car c’est Amazon, mais je regrette vraiment mon achat. Loop mobile est carrément à fuir.

Arrivato anche prima del previsto, ero contentissimo della cosa. I problemi sono cominciati da quando l'ho attivato. In poche parole fintantochè non aggiornavo il sistema operativo staccava ed attacava la rete a suo piacimento, passando da nessun servizio a 4G piena in un secondo: questo problema causava una chiusura delle chiamate vocali dopo una media di 15-17 secondi.Eseguo l'aggiornamento del sistema e la rete cellulare praticamente morta e sepolta su nessun servizio. Avvio le pratiche per il reso ma ancora non ho ricevuto risposta dal venditore. Sono andato in un centro apple e mi hanno detto che nonostante il telefono sia internamente che esternamente sia privo di problematiche non si riescono a spiegare il perchè di questo problema.Spero di non dover ricorrere per vie legali dato che il cellulare l'ho acquistato con finanziamento.

I decided (Jan 23) that my old iPhone 6s was nearing the end of its life - Apple have decided to stop software updates for it going forward and my concern, now that I use banking apps, was as much about security as anything else. Amazon had £50 off so I bought an iPhone 14 128GB.Amazon delivered it as described - they send you a secure 6 digit code when it's out for delivery to read back to the driver - worked fine.I swapped my old O2 nano sim - non US iPhone 14s as of writing still come with a physical sim slot. Worked immediately. I used the Quick Start wizard to transfer everything from the old phone (had to restart old phone at the start of the process to get it to work). I was pleasantly surprised how well this worked.I won't repeat the many reviews of the phone as they're well documented but immediately I am impressed with its speed, clarity of display, how well Face ID works, the camera, battery life etc.I suspect I will keep it until Apple stop supporting it (7 years??) so very happy.

4572,B0BDJH97ZD,4,"
I’m a big gamer so the fact that games like Genshin work super well on the 14 is a bonus for me. The adjustments from android hasn’t been that hard, but I’m not use to a lot of stuff. This review is going off having a Google pixel not an iPhone before this though so what others are saying about the phone being a iPhone 11 Pro I dunno much about. All I can say it’s better than my old phone with a clearer screen, and I love how it connects to my iPad (important to me as an digital artist.)Battery is amazing, again big gamer so the fact I only charge my phone every two days, In love with. My old phones would be every night and as it got older twice a day without gaming. The colour is a bonus too, love purple.I would go off about price. I’m using Amazon payments, but a lot of companies charge this much for a phone, and SE is best bet if you don’t want your phone to do fancy stuff. I personally wanted good camera , good screen and, gaming. That’s what I’m paying for. :)One thing I’d like is to move my music across without a pc. Haven’t found a way yet, so I just download both google music and iTunes.

Had to get an upgrade from my IPhone 12. Couldn’t be more happier with this phone as of right now. Had it for 3 months now and is still running greatly. The battery life has surprised very much as I have left it in charge for too long on the occasion and it hasn’t effected the max battery charge at all. The 5g is great, camera is fantastic and the systems work to a good standard. Great product
"
4574,B0BDJH97ZD,5,"
I was due an upgrade from my iPhone 10. And after reading reviews I was unsure if to go for this or iPhone 13 Pro. Glad I went for this. Compared to previous versions this phone is quicker. Battery life is better then previous version of iPhone. Camera quality is good. Overall happy with the purchase. It is a bit on the pricey side. I would recommend it.

This is the first time I've ever been up to date with my iPhone. I started with a 6s when the 8 was out and had a XR when the 12 was introduced. At the time of getting the 6s I didn't really have much use for a mobile but I could see they'd become more useful in the years ahead. And now my wife and I used them for almost everything from shopping to ordering our medications, the list goes on. So I wanted an Apple phone that was up to date knowing it would last me, or maybe outlast me, for years. And I love my 14. My grandson said I should have got the pro max and gone for the bigger screen. But this fits in the back pocket of my jeans perfectly. Its also the quickest iPhone I've ever used. So I love it and can heartily recommend it to anyone who, like me doesn't want a fashion statement but a phone that does all you need it to.

4578,B0BDJH97ZD,4,"
A great phone with long battery life and fab camera. The only ‘fault’ is that the SOSEmergency alarm went off while I was driving over a bridge which had regular bumps, was curved and in the traffic was driven at quite a speed. The phone was resting in a cup holder and so was shaken so much the alarm went off and we received a phone call to see if the emergency services needed to be called. The alarm itself was so loud it made me jump. So now I make sure the phone is safely held down.  Otherwise it’s a brilliant bit of kit.

Wow I love this Iphone, I upgraded from the iPhone 12 for a few reasons, the iPhone 12 is great but the battery life is not the best but it's much improved on the iPhone 14 and I needed a phone with more storage so went for this and so glad I did, setting this phone up ran so smooth and fast and for some reason apps seem to download so much faster on this phone and my signal seems a lot stronger, everything runs really smooth on the phone and it's just the perfect size for me, it's the perfect phone for me that I highly recommend. Very pleased with my purchase and glad I went and  got it, oh and feels nice to use hold and use aswell, not had it long but so far can't fault anything with it.

Better battery, but it didn’t copy over all my phone contacts. Synced and backed up my old phone prior, but still not there. Rang Apple said could be glitch with latest update. So the only thing is lost my contacts which is a pain as don’t have any names.

Don't believe me? see how similar they are on gsmarena.Notice how the iPhone has barely evolved since the 10?You get the original design, 4 style design, the 6 style design and 10 style design. That’s only 4 design styles over the years.I tested this iPhone and found the camera is shockingly bad especially for closeup pics, gets blurry when my old 6s could’ve taken closeup pics easily and they were sharp.the iPhone 14 'pro' is the true iPhone 14 you could say, the next step in the evolution of these iPhones considering the dynamic island feature. Seriously, what was the point of the iPhone 14? It's more pointless production and needless waste of resources.If they really want to release a phone every year the changes need to be significant. 14 looks the same as 13 and before. Notch improved? That’s not enough to warrant a whole new phone. The innovation is so lazy, slow and conservative.Meanwhile, Samsung are now in folding phones territory where I think the trend should go next.Speaking of releases I don’t think it’s necessary to release a phone every year. A phone is a phone. I was using my 6s this year and still was doing the business for me so it’s pointless and a waste of resources to spew out phones every year. How many more phones are they going to churn out every year when its clear the iPhone series is plateauing? Makes me wonder what the iPhone 57,485,007,327 will look like, lol (I dread to imagine a future like that and how many landfills exist of old discarded phones, rotting and destroying habitats, but i digress).And given the current cost of living crisis, who in their right mind can afford an iPhone these days when many of us in the real world are having to make decisions like heating or eating? Apple say its 'only' 800 quid or whatever (charging British consumers more than the americans), as if thats cheap - mate, i can get a smartphone for less than 100 off ebay that can still do the same stuff the 14 can do - calls, pics, music, internet, youtube. Apple is SO out of touch with reality and what people can really afford.Before you react with your emotional responses - no, I'm not a fan of samsung. Or apple. or sony. or microsoft. or google. or amazon. or facebook. or whatever-big-company-entity you can think of.What's the point of this product?
"
4601,B0BDJH97ZD,4,"
This is such a disappointment, it’s marginally better than an iPhone 12 and 13.Is it a good phone? Yes, it’s fabulous.Is it worth buying? Absolutely not.Save up for the pro with the newly designed island, excellent new camera and more powerful processor as the basic 14 is pointless. The 14 max maybe an option if you want something bigger but… overall? A completely underwhelming release, and still no usb-c. Come on apple, sort yourselves out, this is the laziest designed iPhone in years.

This is a great phone in almost all respects but coming from a 2016 SE this thing is huge, too wide, too thick. I am over 6 ft with massive paws but find it difficult to use with one hand without the constant risk of dropping it.  I erred for a while whether to get the newest or the 13 mini and assumed as they no longer make the mini it wouldn’t a problem. Well apple, if you are reading this, size matters and after a few weeks I’m slightly regretting my choice.
"
4603,B0BDJH97ZD,2,"
A price hike AND the same processor as last year?! (Yes, I know there is one extra GPU). Thanks, I will pass Apple, and get the 13 when I upgrade.

iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are stripped down iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max's. These are no different than the iPhone 13 from 2021 as the internals are the exact same, all they did was take the A15 Bionic chip out of the 13 Pro/Max and that is literally it. Hence, making it a stripped down, knock-off version of the 13 Pro/Max.iPhone 13 Pro/Max is the better phone and better value for money. It has a 120Hz refresh rate display which makes everything look very smooth and responsive, a much better camera system, better battery life, Stainless Steel build instead of the cheap Aluminium. You have to be a clown to willingly buy the 14 and 14 Plus. iPhone 14 is a rip off version of 13 Pro and 14 Plus is a rip off of 13 Pro Max, while making worse at the same time.Don't waste your money on this trash as it was made to be a quick cash grab from Apple. You'll be able to find a 13 Pro Max 256GB for less than a 14 Plus 256GB.If you don't want the 13 Pro/Max, buy a 13 instead at a discounted price. Just don't be the clown that Apple wants you to be and buy the 14/Plus.BUY THE 13 PRO OR 13 PRO MAX, NOT THIS. DO NOT BUY THE iPHONE 14/14 PLUS

... but at £850+  ?? What's the extra money paying for. I figure, for your basic decent phone, £300 is a rough ballpark. Although I love apple products, typing this on my Mac right now, I don't need to phone someone so bad that I'd pay £850. In fact, I'll just not get this, and won't bother calling anyone. Ever. Thanks, Apple, you turned me into a misanthrope.

Don't. Don't even bother adding the phone to your wish list. Don't even add to cart.The iPhone 14 is literally leftover scraps of the iPhone 13, same specs same everything -Hey, who even wants a 7 inch screen? You might aswell get an iPad or Laptop if you're planning to get a phone BIGGER THAN YOUR HEAD. Period. Don't. The most wasteful £1,000 you can ever spend. Just get an iPhone 13 or below - the safety features even require a subscription? - I am NOT going to pay for a life or death situation, thanks.Please, save yourself and just get a different phone. This is Apple's biggest fail.

The ‌iPhone 14‌'s upgrades over the ‌iPhone 13‌ are questionable. This isn’t an upgrade. It’s literally a repackaged iPhone 13! There are no improvements that make it a worthy purchase. Do yourself a favour. Save £850 by not buying it!

Je suis passe du samsung S22 Ultra que je trouvais trop grand et lourd en main a iphone 14 et je suis très content, oui je sais vous allez dire passer de android à Apple c’est juste pas possible mais détrompez vous moi par exemple en même pas 1 semaine je me suis fait et en venant de android depuis plus de 15 ans donc…niveau batterie je tiens 24h en passant plusieurs heures sur tiktok navigation internet spotify etc et j’ai remarqué un réel gain de plusieurs heures niveau batterie comparé au Samsung S22 ultra aussi en 60hz. J’ai une moyenne de 9h écran allumée en 24h Apple c’est beaucoup amélioré niveau autonomie j’en suis très content je le recommande a 1000%, il est ni petit ni grand juste parfait, charge via câble 1h40 ok vous allez dire c’est long il y a mieux mais voila je tiens 24h et il me reste minimum 20% de batterie donc je suis tranquille. J’espère avoir aidé car moi j’ai beaucoup hésité venant de android mais j’en suis vraiment pas déçu j’en suis même très très content voila voila

Die Kritik, dass sich so wenig zum Vorgänger getan hat kann ich nicht so ganz nachvollziehen. Ich kaufe mir doch auch kein neues Auto, wenn es Facelift ansteht, sondern warte auf den direkten Nachfolger. Das iPhone 14 ist Modellpflege vom 12er und 13er was man auch direkt am Aussehen erkennen kann. Ich bin vom 11er auf das 14er gesprungen und merke schon deutliche Unterschiede.+ super Verarbeitung+ edles Design ohne spürbare Kanten oder Spalte+ Display ist sehr gut verarbeitet und hell+ das iOS. Das Herzstück wie immer DER Kaufgrund für ein iPhone. Ich habe neben diverser Apple Geräte so ziemlich alle Betriebsysteme der letzten Jahre und Hersteller durch. Daher will ich auch keine Grundsatzdiskussion vom Zaun brechen. Für mich ist Apples System die Speerspitze.  Wenn man nun noch mehrere Geräte aus dem Apple Universum benutzt steigert sich das Ganze sogar noch und man hat ein Biotop was genialer nicht sein kann.+ Kamera und die neuen Videofunktionen sind sehr gut. Wer hier kritisiert, dass Apple keine 60 oder 120MP hat dem sei gesagt: Schaut euch die BIlder im Vergleich an. Mehr Pixel heißt nicht besser! Aber mit irgendetwas muss man ja punkten, wenn es schon nicht das Betriebsystem ist+ der Transfer der Daten vom alten Telefon zum neuen Gerät. Wie immer simpel, schnell und genial einfach- Preis

Dieses Gerät ist für Leute, die ein sehr sehr hochwertiges Handy haben wollen genau das richtige. Das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis ist zwar fraglich, aber man bekommt eben ein extrem hochwertiges Gerät. Für ältere Personen ist dieses Smartphone eher gewöhnungsbedürftig und nicht zu empfehlen, da die Bedienung über wischen und streichen erfolgt. Für Leute, die jedoch damit gut umgehen können, ist das Handy perfekt. Auch die Kamera geht fast nicht besser. Alles in allem ein perfektes Produkt zu einem etwas teuren Preis, aber wer Apple kauft und damit ein sehr hochwertiges Gerät bekommen möchte, muss eben auch mit so einem Preis leben.

Bin vom 12er auf das iPhone 14 in Product-Red umgestiegen weil ich für  mich persönlich einen - wenn auch geringen - Mehrwert gesehen habe, der mir die 999 Euro einfach wert war. Allein schon die Verdoppelung des Einstiges-Speicherplatzes von immer knappen 64 auf für mich üppige 128 GB war mir den Aufpreis wert. Auch die wesentlich verbesserte Reparaturfreundlichkeit (bin diesbezüglich leider ein gebranntes Kind) ist sehr schön, da sich die Glas-Rückwand nun einzeln und rel. günstig austauschen lässt. Das geht bei den teuren Pro-Modellen leider nicht! Erstaunt war ich auch, wie gut ich mein altes iPhone 12 noch verkaufen konnte - das ist für mich ein grundsätzlicher und nicht zu unterschätzender Vorteil der Apple-Handys. Von mir deshalb volle 5 Sterne!

Nach über 20 Jahre Android, auf Empfehlung umgestiegen auf IPhone 14, das war aber dann doch nicht das gelbe vom Ei!alles nicht so Optimal wie man das gewohnt ist, kein Fingerscann dafür Gesichtserkennung aber nur für eine Person was sehr schlecht ist.Die meisten App von Android gibt es auch im Apple Store allerdings bei Android Kostenlos bei Apple  nur ein paar Tage zum Testen dann muss man Zahlen.Bedienung sehr Kompliziert, man kommt sich vor wie bei einer Putzkolonne wischen schieben, es fehlt das waschen!Ladebuchse immer noch Apple eigen, man hat noch nichts gehört von USB C, habe ich bei meinem Android schon seid 3 Jahren.Und nun soll man dafür soviel Geld bezahlen  für was, für den Glauben es wäre etwas besseres, nein Danke.Ist schon auf dem Wege zurück!!!

Ist ja bei Apple nichts neues aber hier merkt man wirklich null Unterschied zu älteren Modellen. Habe nachdem mein 12er kaputt gegangen ist das hier gekauft und es ist schon ziemlich dreist: man merkt wirklich Null Unterschied in der Handhabung und die Kamera ist auch nicht bemerkbar besser. Ganz im Gegenteil sogar, mit dem neuen ios habe ich viel mehr bugs und Aufhänger, dee Akku scheint auch kürzer zu halten. Im großen und ganzen ist es ein super Handy (ios>android), wenn man so viel Geld für ein Hand ausgeben will ok, ich würde aber eher ein älteres Modell kaufen.

I wanted to buy the iPhone 14 pro max but it was out of stock at the time, this phone was my second choice and I’m honestly glad I bought it. Despite lacking a few of the flagship features found in the 14 pro,(such as a 120 hertz display, a few camera upgrades and the dynamic island) it still punches above its weight it terms of quality. After looking at the specifications of this phone and comparing it to the pro model, there are far more similarities than differences. The camera is still spectacular and apart from the macro lens, you would struggle to see the differences in pictures taken with both phones. To summarise, it’s a great phone that’s worth the money
"
4697,B0BDJGM7JB,5,"
Apple return to making a large version of their normal handset for the first time since the 8 plus and what a brilliant bit of kit it is.I find the cameras on a standard iPhone superb and more than good enough for my needs. For the iPhone 12 & 13 I’ve had to get the Pro Max to get the larger screen.Don’t get me wrong, the pro max is a great phone but unless you’re a serious photographer it’s likely the camera’s never going to reach its potential with the average user.Being able to buy the 256GB version of the standard iPhone for more or less the price of the 128GB pro Max is a real yes please moment.As an avid product red buyer I’m also delighted to be able to go back to red. The Pro Max has never been available in any of the colours I like so I’ve always hidden it in a case.The iPhone 14 Plus is fast, the battery life a massive improvement, the cameras are excellent and the price point, whilst expensive, offers the average user more for their money.

4698,B0BDJGM7JB,5,"
Purchased the new iPhone 14 after getting fed up with my old iPhone 6s for a year or so?This is great technology and although it was expensive, Amazon at least gave me 5% off. Could not get anything as trade-in from Apple, so this was a bonus. Changing over to the new iPhone is now very easy.

I love this phone. I've never had an iPhone so from my perspective this item is insanely good.The screen is large, battery lasts long and the camera is extremely good (it supersedes what I had on my previous phones). It's expensive but worth the money.However, from what I understood, the refresh frame on the screen on the Plus version is a bit lower than the Pro. So perhaps if you are picky when it comes to iphones, look into that because it might bother you. It doesnt bother me at all (due to my previous phone being total garbo).5/5 stars! Love it :)

Bought this phone due to upgrading from 11 pro max as I love my big phones ! . It’s really big same size of a pro max . The battery life is much better than my last phone as it lasts much longer . It’s basically pro max but only with 2 cameras ☺️ ! Very happy ! Best phone yet ☺️

The iPhone 14 Plus is extremely bad value. Apart from a slightly larger screen, there are no standout features that make this superior than last years iPhone 13. Even worse, if you pay a little bit more, you can get the flagship iPhone 14 Pro! My biggest question is who did Apple make this for?!

J’ai mis 2 mois à me décider, entre choisir un iPhone 14 , 14 plus ou 13 pro max … désirant un écran assez grand le choix c’est donc fait entre la qualité photo du 13 pro max et la légèreté et l’autonomie du 14 plus . Perso mon utilité personnelle se contente de l’objectif du 14 plus ( et il est déjà pas mal !) question autonomie croyez le ou non le 14 plus me fait 48 h voir plus ! ( jeux , réseaux , Visio …) le 13 pro max pour la même utilité fait un peu moins de 48h (testé) . J’ai donc opté pour le 14 plus et j’en suis ravi, le prix reste élevé mais justifié pour un iPhone de ce genre

Migrating from a iPhone 7 plus after long five years, where the single complaint was battery life, I decided for an upgrade. No charger was provided, but at the end, I've accumulated so many, that this was really not an issue. But a USB-C cable was provided, which is a good help for faster charging. Migrating Apps and settings was really the best experience I had: By starting the new Phone I've had the option for migration, which required just a confirmation on my old device. Passwords were ""automagically"" transferred and in less than one hour everything landed on the new device. Everything was working, including Apple CarPlay and other Apple stuff. Third party Apps were almost Ok, except for very special cases like Bank Account Apps and Authenticators.Other concern was FaceID, since the previous used the fingerprint sensor, but this also worked like a charm, after following the configuration wizard.

Certes l’iPhone et iOS sont une combinaison parfaite. L’écran est très agréable pour naviguer, visionner des vidéos, jouer. Une finition et des matériaux de bonnes factures. Un poids contenu malgré sa taille. Mais le prix, le prix… cher pour une appareil qui ne profite que d’un écran plus grand et recycle le processeur de la génération précédente. Rien de nouveau pour le reste, si vous désirez rester au format plus compact, alors prenez un iPhone 13, le 14 ne vous apportera rien de plus, enfin si, une facture plus salée.

Super schnelle Lieferung und Abwicklung. Beim starten hat er zwar ein Update verlangt, aber war nicht schlimm. Ich kann im allgemeinen noch nicht viel darüber sagen, da ich es noch komplett einrichten muss und mir ein Panzerglas drauf machen lassen möchte. Es ist schon recht groß im Gegensatz zum alten und schwerer. Aber man wusste ja die Größe des Handys laut Hersteller. Wie es sich im Alltag bewährt, wird sich raus stellen. Ich muss es jetzt in Ruhe einrichten. Farbe finde ich okay. Vielleicht in ein paar Monaten mehr.

Bin vom Iphone 12 umgestiegen da ich, ende fünfzig, einfach ein wenig größere Buchstaben brauche (scheiß Altersweitsichtigkeit). Ich bin äußerst zufrieden mit dem Wechsel, whatsapp, Zeitung, Email  etc. sind jetzt (zur Not) auch ohne Lesebrille lesbar. Das Pro max war mir schlicht zu teuer, dessen sicher super Kamera wäre für meine Bedürfnisse überzogen, die Kamera des ""normalen"" 14/14 plus ist schon super für mich. Ob 60 hz oder 120 hz Anzeige ist mir egal, ich bin kein Gamer. Alles in Allem ein tolles, großes Telefon mit dem man für die nächsten Jahre bedient sein wird.  Ansonsten ist es natürlich unübertroffen wie Apple alles zu einen Ökosystem zusammengeführt hat, Iphone, Ipad, Iwatch und Apple TV harmonieren perfekt zusammen, ohne das übliche Geärgere wie bei Android üblich sobald es um mehr als ein Gerät geht.Update nach ein paar Tagen Nutzung im Vergleich zum iPhone pro max meiner Freundin: was sofort auffällt ist dass das Pro deutlich schwerer ist, meiner Freundin ist es egal, deren Handy ist in der Handtasche die eh ungefähr 2 kg Kram enthält, ich habe das Handy in der Jacke, da ist mir das leichte Plus deutlich lieber. Der zweite große Unterschied ist der Akku, das Plus schafft bei mir fast zwei Tage, das Pro nur gut einen.Ich bin auch nach dem Vergleich sehr zufrieden mit der Entscheidung für das Plus und gegen das Pro

J’étais Androïd pendant très longtemps et en vue de mon projet professionnel on m’a conseillé de prendre IPhone ! J’ai donc pris l’ iPhone 14 plus , ça me change la vie , alors oui j’ai mis quelques jours à bien m’adapter mais maintenant en aucun cas je changerai pour aller ailleurs ! La qualité du téléphone, photo , batterie n’a rien avoir ! Je suis ravie de mon achat et je recommande à 1000%

Ich bin sehr zufrieden mit dem Smartphone. Dass es sich hierbei nicht um das 120 Hz Display handelt, fällt eigentlich nicht auf. Nur wenn man es mit diesem vergleicht, im normalen Gebrauch merkt man es nicht außer vielleicht beim Spielen eines Spiels. Ansonsten ist es wirklich sehr gut in der Verwendung, der Akku hält wirklich lange und auch die Kamera macht gute Fotos.Insgesamt finde ich das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis deutlich besser gegenüber den pro Varianten.

Le téléphone est arrivé sans problème via le transporteur, un code est demandé pour garantir la livraison et la boîte est scellée.Je dirai juste que j'ai été surpris de ne pas trouver d'écouteur filaires, pour un tel prix ce serait le minimum sachant qu'Apple fait déjà pas mal d'économie sur le chargeur qui n'est pas fourni non plus.Il n'y a pas non plus de coque ni de protège écran...Le contenu de la boîte se résume au téléphone et au câble usb-c vers lightning. Pour un tel prix on pourrait s'attendre au minimum à avoir un protège écran basique et une coque, le temps d'acheter le nécessaire pour faire mieux.

Wie immer bei Apple, ein top gerät. Die preispolitik bezüglich des speichers ist zwar fragwürdig mit ca 400€ differenz zwischen 128GB und 1TB. Aber mir persönlich reichen 128GB in dem fall. Es ist kein schnäpchen und die arbeitsumstände sollen ja auch nicht die besten sein, doch das müssen die verantwortlichen in den griff bekommen.Im vergleich zu android läuft beim iphone alles flüssig und das gefällt mir.Wer auf ein paar spielereien wie die kameranotch und die kamera pro funktionen verzichten kann aber trotzdem die größe des pro max möchte macht hier nichts falsch. Wenns vom geld her geht. In schulden sollte sich keiner wegen einem smartphone stürzen nur um mithalten zu können. Auch sollte man vielleicht vorher das smartphone mal in der hand haben und das normale mit dem plus vergleichen. Das normale liegt top in der hand, das plus erfordert schon öfters mal beide hände. Somit könnte man sich eventuell paar hundert euro sparen und das normale mit 6,1 zoll nehmen. Es ist auf jedenfall ein unterschied der sich auch in der hosentasche bemerkbar macht.

The phone all around was in great condition and was totally worth the purchase! However if you are a *perfectionist* or whatever, they do come with little imperfections like mine came with little scratches on the corner and sides however with a car on there is no visible damage at all! The battery life is good about a whole day of battery if not used Al day. The only little thing that I can say is bad about my renewed phone is that when I try to play voice messages to my ear it turns the screen black and I have no idea why but it’s barely a big fault! If anyone is wondering whether to get one just ask yourself if your willing to save £200+ for some minor scratches?
"
4773,B08PCB8QCV,4,"
Product arrived in a simple wrap around die cut package, so I was extra careful to inspect for any transit damage, I need not have been concerned the very basic package did its job.First impression was very favourable as I could find no marks, issues, or signs of wear until upon very close inspection I found a tiny small scratch on the top right had side of the screen. The scratch is less than 2 mm in length, does not appear to be 'deep' can only be seen when the screen is off, when on it cannot be seen at all.The battery capacity is showing 90%. However, I have a concern over VFM, I felt at the time it was overpriced. And now seeing that Amazon have reduced the price by a considerable amount after less than ten days, I am even more convinced over VFM, heart over head methinks!My overall 'score' reflects the price paid. However, I am satisfied with the device, it looks new, seems to be 'fit for purpose' and is far superior to my last mobile.I am most certainly looking forward to many years of trouble free usage.

I'm actually really impressed. We paid £453 for an iPhone 12 pro. It came in a standard non branded box, with charger, SIM tool and warranty card. The phone was wrapped in bubble wrap and honestly, looks new. There was some very very minor marks on the sides but literally, they were covered as soon as you picked up by fingerprints, so you wouldn't notice. Everything functions perfectly, face recognition works great. Battery life was 87 percent, which for a 2 year old phone I thought was amazing. I'm so glad we gambled and saved ourselves a couple of hundred pounds. We borrowed an actual box from a friend and gave it to our daughter as a Christmas present, she is in love with it and hasn't asked if it's second hand so clearly hasn't noticed! Amazing, amazing.There was only one downside and that was from Amazon themselves and not the seller. They'd left the package outside in the rain, so it could've easily been stollen or soaked through which would've been a nightmare!

I bought an Iphone 12 pro 128gb 2 weeks ago in 'excellent' condition for £499. I was doubtful It would arrive in the flawless condition they claim but I took a risk. Anyway when it arrived I noticed all 4 corner metal edges of the phone were very slightly damaged (noticeable it had been dropped by the previous owner) but with a basic case on the phone looked brand new. The screen, camera and back of the phone were actually flawless. The battery arrived with 85% life which feels so much longer lasting than the 86% battery life of my XR prior so cant complain. I saved close to £400 and this will be the way I will be buying my future phones DEFO worth the money.

Placed the order for my iPhone 12 Pro in ""Acceptable condition (refurbished)"" on Friday 6th January and received the item the following day. The phone was as descrcibed, only having minor scratches on the screen. The camera lens and the rear of the phone were in good condition with no visible scratches. Lastly, the battery was displaying 88% capacity so all-in-all i am very happy with my purchase. Would definitely recommend!

4778,B08PCB8QCV,5,"
I was sceptical at first, obviously, it was so cheap for something like new. When it came in it’s packaging, I was worried because it looked trash, but once I got it out, started setting it all up… I’m completely convinced I’ve struck gold. Not to be dramatic but I will be buying all my devices here, delivery was also way quicker than it was estimated! I ordered on the 9th, got it on the 12th, and their warranty is true to its word, I had a false alarm and they were completely down to fix it but all it needed was a force restart, lol 👍🏽
"
4779,B08PCB8QCV,5,"
The phone is absolutely in perfect condition! No scratches at all. It seems new. The only thing is the battery which as 84% of capacity is not lasting very much but for the price I’ve got it it’s really worth it!

We purchased the ‘excellent’ condition however it had a gaping scratch on the front and other nicks throughout the screen. This was purchased through Stock Must Go via Amazon.

There is no way of knowing what you’ll get, be warned!!!Unfortunately I had to return the phone and in doing so, PAID FOR RETURN P&PI returned it because the phone only had 92% batt health when I received it and it went down 1% within 2 days of using itTo me, this was catastrophicI used it for a week but I just couldn’t get over the low batt healthFor £615 I was expecting basically unusedI also did some research (after buying this, doh) and found out that iOS 14 KILLED the 12 Pro battery when it was released and I suspect that the phone I received suffered badly because of thisIn terms of condition- the phone was 99% mint, just 3-4 dot-sized nicks out of the chrome edging but no dents or scratches whatsoeverAmazon and MusicMagpie combined were perfect where the return was concerned but I was pretty narked to pay return p&p

For a great many years I have managed to avoid buying an iPhone for myself.Finally, I took the plunge buying refurbished to try it out and save some money whilst also helping the environment. I do not regret my purchase whatsoever and have been a happy bunny. However, the only single down side is the battery life is not what was expected but I’m still charging it once per day as usual anyway, so I can live with that.

4808,B08PCB8QCV,4,"
The phone came in with 92% battery life and no visible marks which is a good sign and one that really matters. However the packaging was absolutely horrible, and I want to stress that it looked as if packaging was done for wood stick. In addition the charger provided with the phone is a really low quality one.
"
4809,B08PCB8QCV,1,"
So after my first attempt to get a refurbished phone, where the phone was in an excellent condition.  I had to return that one and try again.  So I ordered exactly the same phone again, only to find that the phone wasn't in 'Excellent' condition as described on the website.  There were so many scratches around the edges of the phone, although the screen appeared to be in excellent condition, I would have put this in 'Good' or possibly 'OK' condition.  So after my first experience where the SIM card didn't register, I checked that first and it was fine.  So just to be safe I did some more checks the mag charger worked, but the cable charger didn't work.  What does this company actually check before it sends the phone out?  These are basic checks and to say 'Excellent' condition is a joke.  So now after returning 2 iphones I'm still waiting for a refund of £1008.45 for both phones.  Not a great experience.

I purchased an “excellent condition iPhone 12 pro” but the phones battery health on the phone is only 80% which means the phone has been used a lot beforehand. Doesn’t seem excellent to me.
"
4812,B08PCB8QCV,1,"
I purchased this iPhone for my daughters 18th birthday, so it was important for me  to have a phone that looked new. I read the description of a phone rated “excellent condition” and it says screen - no scratches, body - no scratches or dents. Please look at the photos of what I received!! There is a crack in the corner and the screen was covered in scratches, the previous owner clearly hadn’t used a screen protector as my very old iphone 6’s screen is in much better condition. Amazon also had to help me out as the seller doesn’t pay for returns so I have had to pay for the return myself and send a photo of my receipt to Amazon who will refund postage for me. The refund for the phone will take 5-7 days so it means I won’t have my refund quick enough to source another one in time for my daughters birthday. It’s been a bit of a nightmare! The seller needs to be honest with their description as it causes a lot of disappointment and hassle otherwise.

Still appalling value for money, even second hand, they cost mere pounds to make in volume. Price does not reflect intrinsic value, rather what consumers are prepared to pay, and these days they are prepared to pay what Apple tell them to pay. Economics of capitalism. Go research.Cameras are below market average, whatever the reassuring advertising says, it's just words. All the grand images and videos Apple show in their hype ads are created through software rendering. You can get results like these, and better, from any image source using any editing software, even the free ones. Won't be using these for my professional photographic needs, got a 108 megapixel snapper on another brand for that, the difference really does show.Pleased with handset, perfect except for one small mark on bezel. Battery appears okay, but then the phone is only a year old. Some older models I've recently bought (7 and 8 series) needed replacements (easy to do yourself).Will be used as an iPod, not a phone, iTunes is only music player that plays back mix albums without those tiny gaps between tracks, one thing Apple have always got right. On downside, playlists can occasionally cause problems, some won't switch off and can only be deleted via PC, others cause track title/band display errors, especially with mp3s not bought through Apple, but this is a minor niggle, gaplesss playback is why I bought this, that's probably Apple's crowning achievement. When you've gone Android for your phone needs, you don't go back.Had to buy the 256 GB model, not the 128, because iOS generates a permanent massive ""cache"" file in use, up to 10gb, which means this chunk of memory storage can't be used for user files, it's a niggle that's been on iPhones since early days and Apple haven't rectified it, probably think they don't need to, blame it on their customers as usual. It used to be part of the ""system files"" when you check storage use in general settings, now it has its own entry, so at least now you can check how much of your phone's memory storage is unavailable. It's a huge chunk.Lastly, don't buy from Loop Mobile, they aren't nice people to deal with and won't accept you cancelling an order one even if it is only an hour after placing

I was initially unsure about buying a ‘renewed’ iPhone 12 from Amazon and the vendor, Phones Direct uk only had a few ratings but all 100% positive. I went for it and couldn’t be happier (and relived) when it arrived. Quick delivery, well packaged and the phone looked brand new other than not having the protective film on the screen. As it was a ‘renewed’ product I probably spent extra time trying my hardest to find imperfections, tiny scratches etc but couldn’t find a thing, perfect condition. Not sure the plug and charging cable are original but they work as well as my existing apple cable and plug. The quick start guide included is a Phones Direct uk guide rather than an apple one but it was all I needed (the phone does it all for you). Been using the phone for a while and all working as expected. It comes with a 12 month Amazon renewed warranty so still have the same piece of mind as a new phone. Based on my experience, I would buy a renewed product from Phones Direct Uk again.

Excellent condition and works perfectly.

The phone is great condition. Some scratch on the side. The screen is good though, everything works in perfect

Ordered this phone because I tried repairing my phone myself, and it went horribly wrong.. so came onto Amazon and came across this product. I was a bit reluctant because I’ve never ordered a renewed phone, but there was no difference compared to a brand new iphone! No scratches, no damages, and a lot cheaper than ordering a brand new one. Everything works great! It even came with a charger and a plug whereas a brand new iPhone 12 Pro doesn’t come with a plug. Would highly recommend this!

Originally bought this as a mistake instead of Pro Max, immediately contacted seller after buying it but they didn’t respond and sent the item anyway. I decided to keep it as I needed a phone ASAP. 2 weeks in and the battery only lasts a few hours, and now the Face ID isn’t working properly. Seller still won’t respond.
"
4828,B08PCB8QCV,3,"
Just didn’t came with charger, no headsets and battery was well used

Very clean iPhone , zero scratch

I have open box 86% cap battery. It’s draining so quick like 3 to 4 hours. Otherwise phone looks and feels brand new. No scratches. Loved it.

Bought a present for my friend, he was very happy many thanks

4832,B08PCB8QCV,5,"
The phone arrived next day very well packaged and it was all that I thought it would be. Not a mark on it, in excellent condition and very simple to transfer from my old iPhoneI’ve saved over £300 and am very happy
"
4833,B08PCB8QCV,5,"
Iphone 12 Pro came in excellent condition, no scratches, battery is at 89% health. I have no complaints and would definitely buy again from this seller. Delivery made as promised, not in original package, but safe and secure nonetheless. Came with brand new USB to Lightning cable.
"
4834,B08PCB8QCV,3,"
Battery 89,acceptable.But there are scratches which cannot be ignored on the screen and the back,contacted the seller several times and didn’t get the reply.It’s worth the price but it looks absolutely not new.Whatever,it will have the scratches in several weeks after all,and the price was low.这价格还要啥自行车 哈哈哈哈哈
"
4835,B08PCB8QCV,5,"
I was worried about buying a refurbished phone  but took the gamble. It came in two days signed delivery in a non descript white box. The phone was in a sealable bag, with a charging cable (no headphones or plug). The phone was immaculate in every way. The battery life was 89% but must be expected considering the discount in price.I’ve had my IPhone 12 Pro over a month now with no issues or problems. Highly recommend.

Good 👍
"
4837,B08PCB8QCV,5,"
iPhone like new in great condition not a scratch or mark on screen or body. Works perfectly had no problems in setting it up and importing settings from my old iPhone 7. Was a bit worried about face recognition but easy to set up and no probs in use. Camera takes good clear pics. Battery life is good fantastic in comparison to old phone. To sum up very pleased with my purchase.
"
4838,B08PCB8QCV,5,"
So I was really reluctant spending a lot of money on a second hand phone, but safe to say I’m very relieved and actually really happy. I’d say if 100% was a brand new phone, I would say 95%. The tiniest of mark on the screen and that’s it. Which I expected more than that with it being second hand!! And battery health is 94%. Again, what I’d expect with it being second hand. So overall, very pleased and luckily for me worth the risk.
"
4839,B08PCB8QCV,5,"
Scratch free, excellent battery, and half the price. For a year old phone!
"
4840,B08PCB8QCV,5,"
The phone arrived in a foam padded box, with sim tool and charger. The battery health is 100% out of the box and is in pristine condition. There are no surface imperfections whatsoever.The phone functions as if new including facial recognition and cameras.Great value for money. Would recommend.

I was hoping that all the bad review of loop mobile were just some angry client, instead I’ve to say that they were absolutely true LOOP MOBILE let me down big times I bought this iPhone 12 Pro that should have been renewed, when instead The description of the product is completely false, was stating that should be an item that is renewed, when instead the item is just used, not even cleaned, it came with the lcd all scratched, not any kind of protection on top, I wasn’t expecting a protection glass on top but at the very least a kind of film on top of the lcd, the phone was all dirty, and the scratches visible from more than not just 30cm you can see them with your eyes closed, customer service very poor, I had to go through amazon customer service to have any kind of help, and even there just a refund, I needed the phone not something that I’ve to send back and revive the money after another week, absolutely unhappy, be careful to do not order fromLoop mobile if you getting a renewed phone, but get it from the other seller, that instead has very very good reviews, do not make my same error guys…!
"
4844,B08PCB8QCV,5,"
When I ordered this iPhone I wasn’t too sure because of some of the few negative reviews. However the iPhone came in an excellent condition. Almost looked new. Only one minor hardly visible scratch. Functioning like new. Very pleased with it.
"
4845,B08PCB8QCV,1,"
I ordered this and only the charger and the sim came with it. They’re saying I’m not eligible for a refund. What the hell? I’ve been saving up for this and this happens this is why i do not order cheap stuff do not order from here save your money somewhere else.

The first one I received has some scratches on the screen so I return it. The second one (different seller) is spotless, perfect conditions, 2 small scratches on the frame but not impacting screen. Battery life 87%. Really worth the money.
"
4848,B08PCB8QCV,5,"
As with a lot of people I was a bit unsure about buying a refurbished phone, especially when you don't know how it's going to arrive, however I have to say I'm nothing but impressed!No noticeable cosmetic damage, battery health at 99%, it may as well have come factory fresh at this point! Would definitely recommend, especially given the price.
"

Couldn’t be happier, looks like new apart from the tiniest blemish on the frame which is covered by a case anyway. Screen is completely blemish free and although it comes with an Amazon 12 month warranty the Apple warranty runs until April 2022.

Bought as a “renewed” phone but it looks brand new, took me ages to spot a minute mark on the edge, came with a fast charger and lead with free 24 hour delivery, why pay full price for a new one.
"
4857,B08PCB8QCV,5,"
Good value for money, battery life only goes up to 91%, but manageable, everything else works perfectly well, good investment
"
4858,B08PCB8QCV,5,"
You wouldn’t know that this phone is used at all. There’s not a single scratch on it, works really well. The only way I know this is used is that the battery health is 94% - but I’m still really happy and would definitely buy a refurbished phone again.
"
4859,B08PCB8QCV,5,"
Great value for money. Reconditioned phone arrived ahead of time. Phone looks perfect. Transfer from old iPhone was extremely easy.  I saved a lot of money as against buying a brand new 13 & this does everything for me. Great service from this seller.
"
4860,B08PCB8QCV,5,"
Was a wee bit apprehensive about purchasing a renewed phone but glad I did. The warranty gives you peace of mind too. My phone came with 96% battery health and a week or so left on apple’s warranty. Genuinely couldn’t find any scratches or anything on the phone. Thanks!
"
4861,B08PCB8QCV,5,"

Wow I was SO nervous to buy refurbished, yet I wanted an iphone 12 pro so much, so I took the plunge and I don't regret it. Battery life was 100% (literally), any scratch of faulty bottom, it was impeccable. I couldn't be happier.

4872,B08PCB8QCV,1,"
The worst seller I have dealt with when it comes to warranty and repairs. I have brought a phone which has 1 year warranty. This seller messed me about so much and never fixed it. I sent it to them 2 times at my own cost. They’re a waste of time and the communication is so poor. It’s like talking to a brick wall and it’ll get you nowhere. Never again will I use them. Avoid at all costs.

It says on the description that you won’t be able to see any damage from 30cm away - this is not true! This phone had lots of scratches and chips that were easily visible from over 30cm away. Got a refund and bought from Apple direct!

The phone provide by Loop-Mobile, I have received is at best described as fair/good standard. It works fine but the cosmetics are damaged on the upper areas of the metal body all around the phone. The phone also arrived dirty, especially around speaker at the bottom of the phone and around volume controls and the camera lens. All easily cleanable but you’d expect the phone to arrive clean if been through their quality control as described. I have requested a refund. I would add that you should check which company you are ordering from as they don’t all come from same one and I’m sure others will be fine.

The first phone sent had a major hardware problem as confirmed by diagnostics at an Apple Store. i thought that was just bad luck so did a return and ordered another. that arrived from a different supplier with a screen with scratch so obvious a blind person could have felt it.

"
4913,B08PCB8QCV,5,"
The only flaw is that the battery (although I knew that refurbished ones don't have 100% working battery) sometimes gets discharged earlier and earlier. I bought it two months ago and at the beginning it was perfect, now I feel that the battery is struggling to recharge.Otherwise, perfect... like new!

The phone is in mint condition, no issues whatsoever, not even a tiny scratch.

It’s a good product delivery service is very discreet, so I am pleased with it

4929,B08PCB8QCV,5,"
I was more concern over ordering renewed product wether it will be an original or will have no warranty, because of Amazon backed 1 year warranty I chose to go ahead. I received a phone in prestine condition (just as new), no wear and tear no scratches just as new. No one can differentiate wether it's a new or renewed. I got 10 months apple warranty remaining on the product. I got mobile in custom box not the apple branded. In the box I got mobile phone, charging cable, No charger included.I am using the phone and have faced no issues at all.
"
4930,B08PCB8QCV,5,"
To be honest, I was a little sceptical about purchasing a phone that appeared to be around 1/3 it's retail price. I've heard the horror stories about people opening their non-Apple certified gadgets and witnessing them crash and burn before their own eyes.The reviews where largely hit or miss, seemed like almost a gamble. You could either end up with a superior find, with beautiful customer servicing - or you could end up with some cranky leftover that isn't worth pennies and peanuts, from a foreign guy over the phone who refuses to give your money back.I'm happy to say that I belong to the former. Upon receiving the phone I find that it works just as intended. No (noticeable) cosmetic or functional damage, no problem switching my SIM card over, and while the battery capacity (86%) isn't exactly something to obsess over, the actual experience of using and charging it feels as if it just came fresh out the Apple Store.  Would definitely recommend this seller and this phone, especially for its price vs retail. However, mind you, make sure you purchase one that's in Excellent condition - I cannot reprimand or tell you about products of a lower grade, and nor can you expect much if it arrives as broken as a lot of these reviewers learnt the hard way. On that end, be sure to know your options if such happens.
"
4931,B08PCB8QCV,5,"
I couldn’t be happier with my renewed iPhone. It’s the first time I have bought renewed and I’m  really impressed: phone looks and operates as brand new, at a fraction of the price. Reuse upgrade is better for the planet too. Max battery capacity reads as 95% but can easily last 48hrs with my usage. Delivered on time in quality protective packaging.
"
4932,B08PCB8QCV,5,"
The phone arrived super quickly. It is in a great condition (super minor scratches can be seen only if you look very closely). It works perfectly well, the battery has 93% of capacity.Overall I am very pleased with my purchase.

"
4934,B08PCB8QCV,4,"
There is a lot of dust and dirt on the handset and charging port of the mobile phone. I used a brush to clean them up carefully, and the battery is a little old, which is normal and acceptable. After all, this is a second-hand product, and other aspects are still okay.
"
4935,B08PCB8QCV,5,"

4936,B08PCB8QCV,5,"
Packaging for the two iphones was very disappointing. both phones wrapped together in bubble wrap and in a flimsy carton which was not much bigger than the phones. However, the phones themselves were in great condition with no visible damage. About 6 weeks since purchase and all going well.
"

iPhone è arrivato in condizioni eccellenti sono soddisfatto La batteria e perfetta e le condizioni del cellulari veramente eccellenti. Posso dire come nuovo.
"
4939,B08PCB8QCV,4,"
Arrivato con un giorno di anticipo, il cellulare è esteticamente e funzionalmente perfetto, nessun graffio nè altri segni di uso neanche cercando con una lente d'ingrandimento. Non mi è piaciuta la confezione per via della protezione morbida che perdeva pelucchi e c'è voluto tempo prima di pulirlo bene per applicare il vetro protettivo (comprato a parte). La vera pecca però è la batteria il cui stato è 84% quindi prossima alla sostituzione.

Sono molto contentx, grazie. Il materiale è molto moderno e anche il design. Sono passato da Android a Apple e posso dire che ne sono contento. Il passaggio era un po‘ faticoso ma è andato tutto a buon fine e anche la spedizione era molto veloce👍

Funzionalità perfetta. Batteria perfetta. Schermo intatto. Piccole tacche da probabile caduta sul margine della cornice (più di una). Tolgo quindi una stella perché non lo considero di prima scelta ma di condizioni accettabili. Mi va bene così ma non sono stato avvertito prima. Imballo inesistente scatolina di cartone in busta gialla pluriboll.  Consegna senza dover firmare.

TELEFONO OK , BATTERIA ALL'86% PERO' TUTTO OK. PER IL MOMENTO CONSIGLIO VENDITORE. FARò ALTRI ACQUISTI IN FUTURO E VALUTERò NUOVAMENTE. SPERO POSITIVAMENTE
"
4943,B08PCB8QCV,4,"
Arrivato prima del previsto il telefono è esteticamente in condizioni eccellenti, come da descrizione, peccato che la batteria invece è all’87%, mi sarei aspettato una percentuale almeno sopra il 90%.

Ho acquistato iPhone 12 pro in stato eccellente…telefono arrivato perfetto pari a nuovo non si direbbe che è un ricondizionato …L unica pecca è la batteria con vita all 83%..x essere pari a nuovo è un po’ poca xo posso dire che è attiva la applecare plus ancora in garanzia..per quanto riguarda il corriere è arrivato con due giorni di anticipo rispetto alla data indicata …ho richiesto la fattura e in meno di due ore mi è stata inviata tramite mail…lo comsiglio
"
4945,B08PCB8QCV,4,"
Ho comprato il dispositivo in “condizioni eccellenti” e sinceramente non mi aspettavo tanti segni di usura come quelli che ho trovato sugli angoli e bordi del telefono, più un segno sul vetro. Quindi tolgo una stella, ma solo una perché comunque sono cose che con cover e vetro di protezione non si notano. Per il resto il telefono è una bomba, la batteria un po’ meno, è all’88% e non dura tutta la giornata. Se penso però che nuovo costa 1200€, più o meno, e che l’ho pagato circa 750€ va benissimo così.
"
4946,B08PCB8QCV,4,"
Alors l’état rien a dire super état ; le chargeur par contre pas top première génération… l’état de la batterie 83% par contre il faut pas appeler sa excellent état je trouve ça vraiment pas top pour le prix

4947,B08PCB8QCV,4,"
Malgrado abbia contattato il venditore chiedendo una verifica della batteria prima della spedizione e mi sia proposta di pagare una differenza per un nuovo acquisto, anche in altro colore, di un prodotto migliore, l'iphone è arrivato con batteria solo al 86%. Lo provo un paio di giorni e valuto il reso
"
4948,B08PCB8QCV,5,"
Ritengo che oggi sia fondamentale riciclare il più possibile...ì cellulari ricondizionati rispettano l'ambiente e permettono a chi acquista di risparmiare molto. Sono soddisfatta dell'acquisto che ho però scelto cercando ricondizionato in OTTIME CONDIZIONI. Esteticamente non ha un difetto e per ora anche il suo funzionamento è perfetto.
"
4949,B08PCB8QCV,5,"
Sono pienamente soddisfatto, nessun problema. Anzi… la batteria originale Apple nuova (100%) nessun graffio… Un ringraziamento va al venditore.Avrei, forse potuto aspettare ancora un po’ … il prezzo probabilmente sarebbe calato. Ma va bene così… per un prodotto ricondizionato… - da quello che sento e leggo in giro - Ripeto Non posso assolutamente lamentarmi.

 Esteticamente impeccabile.Visto che ho scelto un prodotto dalle condizioni “eccellenti” mi aspettavo una percentuale di batteria più alta almeno superiore al 90% mentre la batteria attualmente misura circa 83%. Scalda un po’ quando è sotto carica ma forse quello credo sia una caratteristica del del telefono.

Prima volta che acquisto smartphone di fascia alta ricondizionati:- il telefono si presenta in un imballo Phonem ben fatto, eccezion fatta per la protezione dello schermo totalmente assente in quanto esposto completamente a urti sul lato superiore frontale della scatola;- presenta minuscole imperfezioni appena visibili, quindi prodotto eccellente.Lo sto usando da qualche giorno e sembra tutto perfetto: edizione USA con antenna 5G laterale, per ora funzionante in tutto e per tutto.Giudizio generale ottimo, ma le uniche due pecche, per le quali non mi sento di fornire 5 stelle (specificatamente per il secondo punto), sono le seguenti:- Batteria al 88% della capacità massima, ma comunque entro i limiti del 80% minimo, ma mi sarei aspettato di meglio;- Alimentatore e cavo sono di bassissima fattura  (brandizzati Phonem) e per giunta nemmeno a carica rapida.Per questo secondo punto la questione è alquanto deludente in quanto la quasi totalità degli altri clienti hanno trovato, pur se non originali ma nei limiti di vendita, alimentatori da almeno 20W e cavi USB-C to Lightning, adatti ad un telefono di questo livello, e non capisco per quale motivo nel mio caso siano stati rimpiazzati da questi, tra l’altro inadatti e poco funzionali, obbligandomi a dover temporaneamente usare il vecchio alimentatore e cavo originali del mio iPhone 7 in attesa di ricevere, con altri soldi spesi, alimentatore e cavo nuovi ordinati il giorno stesso.  Consiglierei di rivedere gli accessori obbligatori per telefoni di questa fascia e di mettere in armonia i prezzi sui diversi canali nei quali vendete, per prodotti identici in modello, grado, capacità e colore. Non aggiungo altro.Mi riservo di rivedere la recensione.Giudizio generale ottimo ma non eccellente, venditore più che consigliato.

Ich habe das iPhone 12 Pro in Graphit mit ausgezeichneten Zustand gekauft das iPhone ist aus den USA erkennbar anhand der Antenne die es hier in Europa nicht gibt aber das ist egal sollte nur gesagt sein. Der Ramen ist fast komplett drum rum mit leichten Kratzern versehen was mich persönlich nicht stört da ich es in einer Hülle benutze die Rückseite ist markellos also perfekt. Der einzigste richte Kritikpunkt ist der Akku mit einer Kapazität von nur 88% daher muss ich den Akku bei Apple für 75 Euro selbst wechseln lassen behalte das Gerät trotzdem an sich ein gutes iPhone für den preis.

Compré este terminal hace dos días. Me llegó en 24 horas por DHL. Al principio lo compré con cierta reticencia al no ser enviado por Amazon y no leer precisamente buenas críticas de este vendedor. Admito que me la jugué, y todo por ahorrar, pero pensé, si sale mal el experimento, siempre tengo la opción de devolverlo gracias a la garantía de Amazon. Decir que en este caso acerté, el teléfono vino en estado impoluto (lo elegí dentro de la categoría excelente). Eso sí, la batería me vino con el 86% de salud. Me hubiera gustado un porcentaje más alto, pero está dentro de lo que prometen. En resumen, en mi caso, sí que recomiendo comprar terminales reacondicionados de Amazon. Espero que a alguien le haya servido de ayuda este comentario. Un saludo a tod@s y bona nit 😉

Prodotto ricondizionato in ottimo stato. Sembra nuovo, presenta solo un micrograffio impercettibile (me ne sono accorto cercandolo solo dopo qualche ora) su una delle tre fotocamere. Unico neo lo stato della batteria (85%)  e caricatore non ultrarapido.

J'ai reçu le smartphone hier et j'ai été surprise agréablement en voyant l'aspect extérieur en excellent état ! Aucune rayures. Quelques traces de doigts seulement. En revanche l'état de la batterie 88% je suis moyennement contente. Ce qui m'a le plus déçu et franchement c'est abusé, un chargeur de 1ere génération !!! J'ai mis en charge hier le iphone car quasi plus de batterie quand je l'ai reçu, il a charger pendant 3h pour être à 100%, non mais sérieux, le vendeur aurait pu mettre un nouveau chargeur. En plus je n'ai pas reçu les écouteurs donc dégoûtée.

Sono veramente sorpreso dalla qualità del prodotto: Iphone nuovissimo, non ha neanche un graffietto. Lo stato della batteria è al 100% (sicuramente la terrò sotto controllo in questi mesi ma, se non aggiornerò la recensione, è perché non necessita di aggiornamenti). I venditori sono stati gentilissimi nel rispondermi subito circa un piccolo ritardo dovuto alla settimana del Black Friday. Il prodotto era inoltre ben sigillato, dotato anche di carica batterie. Non potevo farmi un regalo di Natale migliore!

Das IPhone ist in einen optisch exzellenten Zustand. Besser sogar als erwartet und damit von einem neuen nicht zu unterscheiden.

Tutto molto bello, ma pagare 700€ e passa un telefono che dovrebbe essere in ottime condizioni ma con un graffione evidente sul display mi fa rodere parecchio. Inizialmente mi sembrava essere sulla pellicola, ma dopo averla sostituita con un’altra ho capito fosse sul vetro.Sarebbe stato il caso di segnalarlo considerando che è un difetto che si nota anche a più di 30cm di distanza. Ci sarebbe da dire che la fotocamera interna faccia pensare che non sia un iPhone, ovviamente lascia a desiderare. Il resto tutto ok, qualche altro piccolo difetto estetico ma passabile; batteria in buone condizioni.Non sono molto soddisfatta e ovviamente mi asterrò da fare acquisti in futuro da questo venditore.

A primera vista todo parece en buen estado, pero a la que empiezas a fijarte vas encontrando ralladas en la pantalla.El dispositivo viene sin limpiar… en mi caso tenía pegamento en el marco del teléfono.A los días he visto que la batería se gastaba con rapidez, con un uso mediano no podía llegar a las 10h, en mi caso ha llegado con un 86% de salud de batería a los días ha bajado 84%, la verdad a no ser que queráis 1 año de garantía o similar os recomiendo que busquéis uno en Wallapop que seguramente costará menos i tendrá un mejor estado que el “reacondicionado” o prepararos para gastar 75€ en una nueva batería.

Lo que me ha gustado es el estado del celular en general. Tiene micro rayaduras pero casi invisibles, normales del uso. La pantalla es original.Lo único malo, es que la batería vino en un 79% y ya aparece el mensaje de que se tiene que cambiar. Es una pena que la compañía no haga en control necesario antes de enviar estos aparatos y prometiendo que la salud de la batería sería mayor al 80%

4993,B08PCB8QCV,3,"
Premetto che è la prima volta in vita mia che compro un device ricondizionato perché sono abbastanza maniacale sulle mie cose. Ma data la situazione per cui mi serviva questo iphone sono stato disposto a qualche compromesso.Lo stato generale del telefono è più che buono. È arrivato senza la scatola originale ed imballato nella plastica antiurto dentro un pacchetto DHL assicurato.- Packaging non ci siamo proprio! - Capisco che si tratta di un ricondizionato ma un minimo di attenzione per uno smartphone di questa fascia credo ci voglia (ma questo è solo un consiglio per il venditore).Venendo al succo:Estetica ok!Ci sono dei graffietti qua e là, come si vede dalle immagini ma si tratta di graffi di utilizzo, probabilmente è stato esposto (ribadisco, io li noto perché in telefoni che uso quotidianamente da 3/4 anni quei graffi non ci sono ma per qualcuno potrebbero essere graffi fatti in poche settimane di utilizzo).Probabilmente il graffio sulla parte esterna del monitor (vicino allo slot della sim) è il peggiore, più profondo degli altri, probabilmente una caduta senza cover.La cosa peggiore è quella macchia in basso. Dalle foto si vede poco, non si tratta di un riflesso o di una ""ditata"" come potrebbe sembrare. Credo sia stata rovinata la scocca con qualche tipo di abrasione, forse con qualche prodotto che ha tolto il colore. Questo è piuttosto fastidioso ed è una delle motivazioni che mi fa dare 3 stelle.L'altra cosa che terrò sotto controllo è la batteria.Non appena arrivato ho fatto un controllo generale notando che la batteria era al 99% del suo stato di utilizzo.""Wow ho pensato, praticamente nuova!""Mentre scrivo lo sto utilizzando da due settimane e la batteria è scesa al 96% (con una ricarica al giorno).Questa cosa non è proprio normale, non vorrei che nel processo di ricondizionamento sia stata usata una batteria poco adeguata o fallata.Monitorerò la cosa e magari aggiornerò la recensione (se non mi sentite la cosa si è fermata la) ;-)

Cet iPhone 12 Pro reconditionné est impeccable, on le croirait neuf, seule la capacité de la batterie à 91% indique un smartphone d'occasion.  Tout fonctionne de manière fluide, la mise à jour sur iOS 16.1 n'a pas posé de souci et il tient la charge toute la journée - mais je ne joue pas en ligne et je ne regarde pas de séries.  Le bleu pacifique est superbe !10/10 pour le vendeur Certicom en Espagne.  J'ai reçu mon iPhone avant la date prévue dans une boîte blanche générique avec un câble et un chargeur MFI : plus qu'Apple ne fournit ces jours-ci !  J'ai malgré tout acheté un chargeur rapide 20W et un câble Lightning, tous les deux Apple, sur Amazon Warehouse.Bizarre quand même que le livreur (Colis Privé) mette le colis dans la boîte à lettres sans signature, ce n'est pas trop sécurisé...

Arrivato in una scatola anonima con una pellicola di vetro, cover, caricatore e cavetto nuovi (non originali), il prodotto è buono, schermo e retro perfetti, ha solo dei segni di usura (piccoli graffi) sui bordi in acciaio. Il mio è il modello americano, quello con l’antenna 5g per le onde millimetriche, la batteria ha l’89% di capacità, uniche pecche più fastidiose secondo me, è il fatto che un pulsante del volume sia un po’ più “rientrato” rispetto all’altro, le griglie in basso per speaker e microfono non sembrano state riassemblate correttamente (sono un po’ troppo rientrate) e lo schermo nel lato in basso a destra è un po’ scollato, quindi non mi sento di poterlo immergere in acqua con molta sicurezza, per il resto tutto buono

Il device funziona alla perfezione ed a prima vista esteticamente è ineccepibile, anche la batteria risulta pari al nuovo.Guardando con un pizzico di attenzione in più la qualità non è proprio eccellente, ho trovato dei segni sul bordo anteriore dello smart-watch, niente di particolarmente grave, ma la cosa che più si evidenzia è che sull'oggetto che mi è arrivato risulta perfettamente visibile che è stato sostituito il vetro anteriore, in controluce e in condizioni di scarso contrasto a schermo spento, si vede perfettamente come la riparazione non sia stata effettuata in modo professionale. La colla che si stende fra vetro e touch screen non è stata stesa alla perfezione e non copre tutto lo schermo, i risultato è che si vedono i contorni della colla, è vero che si notano solo in determinate condizioni, ma si notano e questo va in contrasto con la descrizione che viene fornita al momento della ricerca. Non è in eccellenti condizioni ma direi più in buone condizioni, detto questo per il resto niente da dire sia per la consegna sia per l'imballaggio e tanto meno sul perfetto funzionamento. Peccato per quel difettuccio che un po rovina il giudizio. Non so se a questo punto lo terrò, valuterò nei prossimi giorni quanto questa cosa mi rimane per la gola.

Looked like it was taken directly out of someone's phone case, and not cleaned.I was expecting a lot better for seven hundred Euro.You know, with a little effort, stainless steel can be polished, to get rid of scratches.Man, I really don't like leaving negative reviews.I was buying this for one of the Ukrainian children living with me.I would have been embarrassed giving this phone to her.I'll give it two stars, since a phone was actually delivered to me.I immediately returned this phone.Bought a new iPhone 13 instead.This was my first experience with a refurbished phone.I 'd be very reluctant to buy a refurbished phone again.I'm giving five stars for the screen and storage, not having seen either, I trust that they were as described.In addition to this refurbished phone that I returned, I also bought an Apple iPhone 12 Pro, 128GB from Swappie.For the same price, it is like a brand new phone - in immaculate condition.Oh, and I'm still waiting for my refund from Ava Direct.I suppose I'll get it, some day...

El producto llegó un día antes, entiendo que el producto es reacondicionado, pero indica que no tiene marcas visibles a 20cm, el caso que llegó con todas las esquinas con picadas, visible a más de 40cm, la batería al 95% y la pantalla perfecta, pero estéticamente se ven marcas de caídas. El teléfono lo envío ciclozero, no creo que vuelva a comprar un reacondicionado, al meno de esta marca. Por lo demás genial, el cargador es “chino” y el cable parece original. No se ha producido a la devolución por qué necesito el teléfono para el trabajo.

Nulla da dire riguardo al telefono che è pari al nuovo, tutto perfettamente funzionante, batteria al 99% e zero graffi o imperfezioni.Riguardo alla spedizione però, purtroppo, mi sono trovata davvero male. Non mi aspettavo la confezione originale apple in quanto in descrizione era scritto che sarebbe stato consegnato in una scatola anonima, però non mi aspettavo neanche di trovarmi, una volta aperto il pacco, il telefono già acceso e quasi scarico avvolto solo da una busta di plastica e dall’imballaggio sempre in plastica. Nessuna scatolina anonima come promesso dalla descrizione e anche il caricatore avvolto da una plastica sottile.Ad ogni modo il telefono funziona e pare non aver subito danni in seguito all’evidente carenza di un imballaggio come si deve.

Gekauft als generalüberholt. Gerät schaut brandneu aus, wie frisch vom Band gefallen: keinerlei Kratzer, Macken oder ähnliches! Wer braucht da noch neu kaufen?!Für mich persönlich war das 12 Pro jedoch leider zu groß und zu schwer. 1-Hand-Bedienung oft schwierig und in der Hosentasche hat man das Gerät deutlich gespürt. Des weiteren wirkt meiner Meinung nach das 12er (& 13er) Modell aufgrund des eckigen (Retro-) Designs dicker und unergonomischer als z.B. ein 11er Modell mit den abgerundeten Ecken. Gerät wurde deshalb umgetauscht. Rückabwicklung ohne Probleme!

Il telefono è pari al nuovo in condizioni perfette, arrivato con gls in una confezione improvvisata ma ben protetto. Il venditore ha aggiunto un carica batterie di iPhone X e precedenti in più la spilletta togli sim. L’iPhone è il modello americano perché presenta l’antenna supplementare per il 5G necessaria per gli Stati Uniti d’America che si trova sul lato destro del telefono. Per questo il prezzo è più conveniente ma ripeto il telefono è pari al nuovo è solo una questione estetica che può interessare come no. Comunque venditore con ottimi prodotti ma deludente per quanto riguarda l’assistenza. Avevo mandato un paio di mail per la tracciabilita del pacco e non ho mai avuto risposta. Anche sul numero di cellulare ho mandato un messaggio whatsapp che ancora non riceve, ho anche provato a chiamare ma era sempre spento. Ma a me interessa che il telefono funzioni e che sia in ottimo stato.  Comunque Incrocio le dita e darò notizie in seguito.

Il telefono è arrivato in una scatola anonima dotato di carica batterie e cavetto + spilletta per la sim.Il telefono in se non presenta nessun graffio o segno di usura e la capacità della batteria è al 100% quindi è un telefono nuovo! Consegna rapida, il giorno dopo la data prevista, arrivato proprio in tempo. Sono davvero soddisfatta anche per quanto riguarda la serietà del venditore e la risposta rapida dei messaggi. Prezzo davvero ottimo in quanto telefono identico al nuovo, poiché comprando uno nuovo nei negozi apple ancora si pagano sui 1000€ . Sono molto soddisfatta, lo consiglio

Ho acquistato un Iphone 12 proPensavo acquistando un prodotto ricondizionato che avesse qualche imperfezione, invece zero, nessuna, il prodotto è pari al nuovo. Arrivato in tre giorni, buona confezione, pacchetto con logo ""loop"", dentro caricabatterie e chiavetta per sim, oltre le istruzioni. L'ho portato a mettere la cover ed il venditore si è complimentato per lo stato del cellulare. Che dire fa foto splendide, il riconoscimento facciale è perfetto per l'home banking e per le altre app, la velocità è portentosa, il suono anche. Un consiglio anche se condizionato scegliete il venditore e non badate a risparmiare. C'è sempre il detto di chi più spende, meglio spende.

Diese Rezension beschreibt NICHT das iPhone 12, sondern den Kauf bei ""Amazon Renewed""/""Mobihub.de"".LieferungDie Lieferung wurde nach zwei Tagen zugestellt. Neben dem iPhone lagen noch ein No Name-Ladegerät und eine Sim-Nadel im Paket. OVP und die originalen Apple Zubehöre waren - wie in der Artikelbeschreibung erwähnt - nicht enthalten.Äußerer ZustandDer äußere Zustand des iPhones entsprach ebenfalls der Artikelbeschreibung: aus 30 Zentimeter Entfernung waren überhaupt keine Gebrauchsspuren erkennbar. Selbst bei genauer Betrachtung erwiesen sich alle Oberflächen als makellos. Das möchte ich extra hervorheben: Das Gerät ist ziemlich genau ein Jahr alt und hat trotzdem eine neuwertige Optik.Die Schalter/Taster am Gehäuse sind ebenso in Ordnung. Einziger kleiner Schwachpunkt: Der Lautlos-Schalter ist sehr schwergängig. Es wirkt, als ob im Inneren des Schalters fest gebackener Staub wäre. Die Funktionalität ist dadurch jedoch nicht eingeschränkt. Man kann den Schalter halt nicht ""so nebenbei"" betätigen, sondern muss sich darauf konzentrieren und die Rückmeldung am Display kontrollieren.TechnikDas iPhone war auf Werkseinstellungen zurückgesetzt und konnte problemlos gestartet/installiert werden.Im Betrieb treten keinerlei Fehlfunktionen auf.Der Akku ist bei akzeptablen 89 %. Das liegt im Korridor der Artikelbeschreibung (""über 80 %""). Es lässt aber auch auf eine intensive Nutzung im ersten Lebensjahr schließen.FazitBei Renewed/Refurbished-Angeboten ist natürlich keine allgemeine Aussage möglich, da sich jedes Exemplar vom anderen unterscheiden kann.Für ""mein"" iPhone kann ich sagen: bisher ein Kauf ohne Reue. Das Produkt entspricht der Artikelbeschreibung. Es gibt keinen Anlass zu Kritik.Und sollte doch noch ein Fehler auftauchen, würde die Garantie von 12 Monaten greifen.

Il prodotto oltre ad avere qualche segno di usura (che comprendo possa avere in quanto ricondizionato) aveva delle macchie di grasso che potevano benissimo essere quantomeno tolte prima di metterlo in commercio.La cosa imperdonabile è sicuramente l'audio danneggiato. Ho ascoltato varie canzoni comparandolo con un'altra 12 pro e con il mio si sente distorto. Persino comprando la suoneria, nel mio caso si sente che non è pulita ma con una leggera distorsione. Per me che lavoro nel settore musicale è un guasto imperdonabileNon ha alcun senso acquistare un ricondizionato se poi non vengono fatti i test a dovere per sostituire parti danneggiate...Per questo richiederò il rimborsoPer questa ragione richiederò il rimborso

5068,B08PCB8QCV,3,"
Il telefono è venuto molto bello, senza grafie e con la batteria 90%. Però lo schermo sembra di essere stato cambiato perché il touchscreen è molto lento. Non è veloce come un schermo originale. Avevo pensato di essere colpa della pellicola, ma no. È proprio del telefono.

Prodotto rigenerato, consegnato in tempi celeri. Il prodotto si presenta in una scatola generica Loop, lo smartphone all’interno compreso di cavo e in uno scatolo separato il caricabatterie da 30w. Il telefono è in perfette condizioni estetiche, batteria al 98% (nel giro di qualche settimana scesa al 96%). Unica pecca, durante la prima configurazione ho notato con mio profondo dispiacere, una piccola, quasi impercettibile macchiolina nera nel lato basso/sinistro del display confinante con il bordo del display (sicuramente Pixel Bruciato). Non ho chiesto la sostituzione perché resterei a piedi(senza smartphone) e ne ho necessità per lavoro. Per me questo problema è un pugno in faccia perché da quando l’ho notato mi porta nervoso (mi cade l'occhio lì) visto la fiducia riposta è il prezzo pagato.

Tras estar bastante escéptico a comprar un iphone reacondicionado, me animé teniendo en cuenta la garantía de amazon y que en caso de que tuviera cualquier problema lo podía devolver y listo. Pues bien, el teléfono ha llegado en muy buena condición. Ningún rasguño en la carcasa y un pequeño arañazo casi imperceptible en la pantalla principal, que además viene cubierta de un protector. La salud de la batería está al 92%. La verdad es que para mí este punto es muy importante y un 92% para mí si es aceptable. Seguiré probándolo pero por ahora solo estoy teniendo buenas sensaciones y si todo sigue así me quedaré el dispositivo. Muy contento.

Modello destinato al mercato americano in quanto provvisto di modulo 5G mmWave che si può notare da una tacca appena percettibile al di sotto del pulsante di accensione, ma non sfruttabile in Italia (per ora). Il prodotto è di qualità come tutti gli iPhone che non vengono maltrattati, trattandosi di un ricondizionato.

Me a gustado la pantalla y las cámaras que tiene y lo que menos me a gustado es que la salud d la batería es solo de 89% y tendré que cambiarla pronto

5081,B08PCB8QCV,5,"
Wie von Apple zu erwarten, hat dieses Telefon keinerlei Macken, hängt sich nie auf und sieht optisch (bis auf die gewöhnungsbedürftige Notch) nicht schlecht aus. Die Kameras funktionieren einwandfrei und während eines Videos kann es perfekt zwischen den verschiedenen Linsen wechseln, ohne das das Videomaterial darunter leidet. Da es das erste Apple iPhone für mich ist, muss ich mich noch von umständlichen Android hin zum einfach zu bedienenden Alleskönner umstellen. Der Batteriezustand ist leider nur bei 88% gewesen, aber er hält trotzdem den Tag durch.Klare Kaufempfehlung an dieser Stelle für das iPhone 12 Pro in der 128 GB Variante.Da ich leider keinen 5G-fähigen Vertrag habe, kann ich dazu nichts sagen, aber LTE /4G reicht für normale Zwecke vollkommen aus.

Nel corso della vita ho acquistato diversi telefoni. Tanti nuovi e diversi ricondizionati.Se si ragiona con calma e a sangue freddo si capisce che si può ottenere ottimo prodotto di modello precedente ( rispetto quello che si vende adesso) a un prezzo davvero interessante ( non regalato).Preso su Amazon e lo utilizzo da due mesi. Non vedo nessun minimo difetto, funziona perfettamente, batteria nuova e nessun graffio o segno di usura. Vi consiglio vivamente di considerare ricondizionato al posto del nuovo

Compré el Iphone 12pro en condición supuestamente excelente por 809€ , Según la descripción y sus términos, no debería tener arañazos ni desperfectos estéticos en pantalla, laterales ni marcas visibles a 30cm de distancia, lo cual no se cumplió en ningún aspecto. Cabe decir que fue el único que rebajaron 100€ en 1semana y decían que era el último en stock, a pesar de que repusieron 1 o 2 más, sin embargo al pedir un cambio, me dijeron que no tenían ninguno en stock en esas condiciones. Para mi sorpresa, me encuentro lo que veis en las fotos. Un terminal en Condiciones satisfactorias y además me querían cobrar 12€ de envío para la devolución. Tuve que recurrir a Amazon y a las cláusulas de Amazon Renewed para llevar a cabo la devolución para recibir el reembolso integro.Experiencia muy mala...

Acquistato e spedito Venerdì, consegnato martedì mattina.Il telefono arriva in una confezione non originale, completo di cavo usb-c lightning, estrattore sim e, udite udite, caricatore usb-c da 30 watt.Il telefono è praticamente perfetto; ha solo una piccola ammaccatura nell’angolo inferiore sinistro, perfettamente camuffata dalla cover.

Rimpiango il vecchio 6 plus, che ho cambiato dopo sei anni, causa  vetro rotto e batteria esaurita, mai cambiata. Il 12 pro, anche se ricondizionato con batteria al 90%, ha una ridotta durata della batteria, di gran lunga inferiore alle prestazioni dichiarate e attese. L'unico aspetto apprezzato è il grandangolo e l'uso con poca luce della fotocamera.

Le téléphone fonctionne parfaitement, il parait neuf je suis très content de l'achat après quelques jours d'utilisation. Cependant le chargeur fourni fonctionne mais charge très lentement il faut penser à racheter un câble mais sinon tout est nickel

ok

No viene en su caja original ni con cargador-cable original. Pero está completamente NUEVO, ni un solo rasguño, ni al sol. La batería está al 86% lo cual está bien ya que prometen un mínimo de 80%. El terminal va super bien para lo que un iPhone se le espera.En mi caso estoy contento con este producto reacondicionado. El tiempo dirá si ha sido una buena inversión.

Mi sono rivolto ad Amazon per l’acquisto del cellulare rigenerato sicuro che non sarei rimasto deluso. Le aspettative sono state ampiamente confermate. Il cellulare è assolutamente pari al nuovo, con una capacità residua del 96% della batteria e l’assoluta assenza di imperfezioni. Ottimo acquisto come sempre Amazon è una garanzia in più.

 Prima e sicuramente ultima esperienza con un telefono ricondizionato. La confezione poteva essere curata meglio mettendo una pellicola protettiva adesiva sullo schermo,Il telefono era stato ripulito sommariamente aveva polvere e sporcizia sia nell attacco di ricarica della batteria che bello sportellino sim che intorno alle fotocamere inoltre non ho potuto valutare niente altro in quanto. On sono riuscito neanche a configurarlo perché dopo selezionata la lingua alla selezione del paese il telefono si bloccava e dopo venti secondi mi rimandava alla selezione della lingua.

Pagato rigenertao circa 850€. Esteticamente molto bene, ma batteria al 90% (ok che ancora buona ma x 850€ la potevano cambiare), problemi di connessione bluetooth (sia watch, sia airpods, sia altre marche….no), problemi di connessione con la macchina.Restituito subito
"
5138,B08PCB8QCV,3,"
The phone arrived in perfect conditions the only problem I’ve seen is with the battery it dies quite faster than expected but that also might be related to the usage I give to it but it doesn’t lasts all day long.

Acquistato dopo aver visto alcune recensioni, ma sono rimasto un po’ deluso. Batteria al 89% e con alcuni graffi sul lo schermo e al entrata del carica batteria. Il se ascolti una canzone il telefono si scarica in maniera folle. Pensavo davvero che avessi più qualità.

Absoluter Fehlkauf! Habe das iPhone mit ausgezeichnetem Zustand bestellt. Das Gerät kam absolut verschmutzt an. Die Lautsprecher sind völlig verdreckt und dicht. Die Akkuleistung betrug gerade mal noch 85%. Also definitiv nicht generalüberholt! Noch dazu war eine fremde Simkarte im Telefon und es kamen ausländische Nachrichten an. Die Verpackung wurde mit Aufklebern komplett zugeklebt, dass eine schadensfreie Entfernung nicht möglich war.Suchen sie sich einen anderen Verkäufer für ihr Gerät. Katastrophe. Nie wieder!
"
5147,B08PCB8QCV,5,"
Also ich bin echt begeistert. Die Lieferung erfolgte wirklich sehr schnell und der Zustand ist wirklich 1a. 100% Batterie, kaum äußerliche Gebrauchsspuren. Echt Top!
"
5148,B08PCB8QCV,5,"
Absolut zu empfehlen. Ist mein erstes iPhone, ich wollte zusätzlich zum Preis auch die Umwelt schonen und daher ein refurbished kaufen. Allerdings war ich etwas unsicher was mich wohl erwarten würde… alles super! Der Akku liegt bei 98% Kapa, und der Zustand ist echt der Hammer. Bis auf ein paar Mikrokratzer am seitlichen Rahmen alles top. Kann’s nur jedem empfehlen!
"

Il telefono è pari al nuovo, a dir poco impeccabile. Il modo con cui è stato impacchettato a mio dire pessimo. Per il resto davvero ottimo davvero.

L’iPhone 12 pro che ho acquistato ricondizionato come condizioni “eccellenti” presenta delle imperfezioni estetiche ed inoltre una vite in prossimità del connettore lightnin è leggermente svitata.Durante le prime prove di funzionamento ho subito notato una bassa potenza e qualità dell’audio sonoro dell’altoparlante. Successivamente mi sono accorto che la cuffia per le chiamate audio non funziona. Provvederò al rimborso

Das Display ist super und die Akkulaufzeit ist wie bei einem Neugerät.Der Versand ging sehr flott und sicher verpackt.

Me ha gustado la rapidez. No me ha gustado que no tenga caja, ni cargador y cable original ni la aguja para sacar la sim. Tiene un precio elevado para ser reacondicionado con esas faltas.

Das gebrauchte IPhone12 pro kam wie angekündigt in einer neutralen Verpackung mit Ladekabel und Zubehöradapter. Die Lieferung war schneller als angekündigt. Der Akku bei 93%, also alles super…?Leider konnte ich nur über den Lautsprecher telefonieren, die Hörmuschel funktioniert nicht.Apple hat hierzu auch schon mitgeteilt:„Apple hat festgestellt, dass es bei einem sehr kleinen Prozentsatz von iPhone 12- und iPhone 12 Pro-Geräten aufgrund einer eventuell fehlerhaften Komponente des Hörermoduls in manchen Fällen zu Tonproblemen kommen kann. Betroffene Geräte wurden zwischen Oktober 2020 und April 2021 hergestellt.Wenn dein iPhone 12 oder iPhone 12 Pro beim Tätigen oder Empfangen von Anrufen keinen Ton aus dem Hörer abgibt, ist es möglicherweise für Service qualifiziert.Qualifizierte Geräte werden von Apple oder einem autorisierten Apple Service Provider kostenlos repariert“Nur war dies bei dem gelieferten nicht mehr möglich, da die Garantiezeit abgelaufen war - das Telefon also nicht mehr „qualifiziert“ war.Das hätte eigentlich bei einem Test auffallen müssen. Werde das Telefon daher zurück schicken.

Handy war optimistisch entsprechend der Vorstellung (kleiner optisch gut sichtbarer Kratzer entsprach nicht der Vorstellungwar aber akzeptabel für den Preis).

The phone all around was in great condition and was totally worth the purchase! However if you are a *perfectionist* or whatever, they do come with little imperfections like mine came with little scratches on the corner and sides however with a car on there is no visible damage at all! The battery life is good about a whole day of battery if not used Al day. The only little thing that I can say is bad about my renewed phone is that when I try to play voice messages to my ear it turns the screen black and I have no idea why but it’s barely a big fault! If anyone is wondering whether to get one just ask yourself if your willing to save £200+ for some minor scratches?
"
5252,B08PCDP3LM,4,"
Product arrived in a simple wrap around die cut package, so I was extra careful to inspect for any transit damage, I need not have been concerned the very basic package did its job.First impression was very favourable as I could find no marks, issues, or signs of wear until upon very close inspection I found a tiny small scratch on the top right had side of the screen. The scratch is less than 2 mm in length, does not appear to be 'deep' can only be seen when the screen is off, when on it cannot be seen at all.The battery capacity is showing 90%. However, I have a concern over VFM, I felt at the time it was overpriced. And now seeing that Amazon have reduced the price by a considerable amount after less than ten days, I am even more convinced over VFM, heart over head methinks!My overall 'score' reflects the price paid. However, I am satisfied with the device, it looks new, seems to be 'fit for purpose' and is far superior to my last mobile.I am most certainly looking forward to many years of trouble free usage.

I'm actually really impressed. We paid £453 for an iPhone 12 pro. It came in a standard non branded box, with charger, SIM tool and warranty card. The phone was wrapped in bubble wrap and honestly, looks new. There was some very very minor marks on the sides but literally, they were covered as soon as you picked up by fingerprints, so you wouldn't notice. Everything functions perfectly, face recognition works great. Battery life was 87 percent, which for a 2 year old phone I thought was amazing. I'm so glad we gambled and saved ourselves a couple of hundred pounds. We borrowed an actual box from a friend and gave it to our daughter as a Christmas present, she is in love with it and hasn't asked if it's second hand so clearly hasn't noticed! Amazing, amazing.There was only one downside and that was from Amazon themselves and not the seller. They'd left the package outside in the rain, so it could've easily been stollen or soaked through which would've been a nightmare!

I bought an Iphone 12 pro 128gb 2 weeks ago in 'excellent' condition for £499. I was doubtful It would arrive in the flawless condition they claim but I took a risk. Anyway when it arrived I noticed all 4 corner metal edges of the phone were very slightly damaged (noticeable it had been dropped by the previous owner) but with a basic case on the phone looked brand new. The screen, camera and back of the phone were actually flawless. The battery arrived with 85% life which feels so much longer lasting than the 86% battery life of my XR prior so cant complain. I saved close to £400 and this will be the way I will be buying my future phones DEFO worth the money.

The phone was as descrcibed, only having minor scratches on the screen. The camera lens and the rear of the phone were in good condition with no visible scratches. Lastly, the battery was displaying 88% capacity so all-in-all i am very happy with my purchase. Would definitely recommend!

Great product and arrived on time however the battery life was on 86% which is quite low but I will get it replaced
"
5257,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
I was sceptical at first, obviously, it was so cheap for something like new. When it came in it’s packaging, I was worried because it looked trash, but once I got it out, started setting it all up… I’m completely convinced I’ve struck gold. Not to be dramatic but I will be buying all my devices here, delivery was also way quicker than it was estimated! I ordered on the 9th, got it on the 12th, and their warranty is true to its word, I had a false alarm and they were completely down to fix it but all it needed was a force restart, lol 👍🏽
"
5258,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
The phone is absolutely in perfect condition! No scratches at all. It seems new. The only thing is the battery which as 84% of capacity is not lasting very much but for the price I’ve got it it’s really worth it!
"
5259,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
I bought the acceptable one and it looked brand new it even came with a glass screen protector definitely would recommend
"
5260,B08PCDP3LM,5,"

This was my first experiences for a renewed phone. The product is as told in add really perfect. Condition is pristine/excelent. No ever small strachs anywhere. I'd like to thank you Mazuma. The contact with Mazuma was also perfect. Tey were so kind. They answered my questions as soon as possible and helped too much. Thanks a lot. I do not hesitate then to buy the next item from this company. Thanks.

Came exactly as described with no scuffs or scratches on the phone.  Battery health was 87%.
"
5277,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
Excellent deal with good allowance on my old phone
"
5278,B08PCDP3LM,2,"
We purchased the ‘excellent’ condition however it had a gaping scratch on the front and other nicks throughout the screen. This was purchased through Stock Must Go via Amazon. The rest of the phone was in pretty good condition annoyingly as I would of preferred it the other way round. Battery health was at 83% so at the lower end.The company did offer to refund/exchange.
"
5279,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
This is second renewed iPhone I’ve had from Amazon. Delighted with quality (like new) battery health decent (92%).  Only negative is charging cable, poor quality, both have failed within 3 months.
"
5280,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
The battery life and face recognition are all in good condition
"
5281,B08PCDP3LM,3,"
There is no way of knowing what you’ll get, be warned!!!Unfortunately I had to return the phone and in doing so, PAID FOR RETURN P&PI returned it because the phone only had 92% batt health when I received it and it went down 1% within 2 days of using itTo me, this was catastrophicI used it for a week but I just couldn’t get over the low batt healthFor £615 I was expecting basically unusedI also did some research (after buying this, doh) and found out that iOS 14 KILLED the 12 Pro battery when it was released and I suspect that the phone I received suffered badly because of thisIn terms of condition- the phone was 99% mint, just 3-4 dot-sized nicks out of the chrome edging but no dents or scratches whatsoeverAmazon and MusicMagpie combined were perfect where the return was concerned but I was pretty narked to pay return p&p

5282,B08PCDP3LM,4,"
For a great many years I have managed to avoid buying an iPhone for myself.Finally, I took the plunge buying refurbished to try it out and save some money whilst also helping the environment. I do not regret my purchase whatsoever and have been a happy bunny. However, the only single down side is the battery life is not what was expected but I’m still charging it once per day as usual anyway, so I can live with that.
"
5283,B08PCDP3LM,4,"
I like my iphone 12 pro but the battery life is not really good what I expected 😕
"
5284,B08PCDP3LM,4,"
I bought this to replace my iPhone XS. As the battery was bad and needed to improve the tech.  But this arrived with only 83% battery health. So I sent it back. It clearly stated it would be much more than this too.  So not great.
"
5285,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
Phone was smashed and not functional, the battery seemed to explode and expects me to return the phone even though it’s a hazard and that making the proccess even longer
"
5286,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
It came in superb condition. The battery had great health, and everything else works spot on. I am very pleased with my purchase I would buy from the seller again. This is a great phone for all age groups. The camera is my favourite feature
"
5287,B08PCDP3LM,4,"
The phone came in with 92% battery life and no visible marks which is a good sign and one that really matters. However the packaging was absolutely horrible, and I want to stress that it looked as if packaging was done for wood stick. In addition the charger provided with the phone is a really low quality one.

5288,B08PCDP3LM,1,"
So after my first attempt to get a refurbished phone, where the phone was in an excellent condition.  I had to return that one and try again.  So I ordered exactly the same phone again, only to find that the phone wasn't in 'Excellent' condition as described on the website.  There were so many scratches around the edges of the phone, although the screen appeared to be in excellent condition, I would have put this in 'Good' or possibly 'OK' condition.  So after my first experience where the SIM card didn't register, I checked that first and it was fine.  So just to be safe I did some more checks the mag charger worked, but the cable charger didn't work.  What does this company actually check before it sends the phone out?  These are basic checks and to say 'Excellent' condition is a joke.  So now after returning 2 iphones I'm still waiting for a refund of £1008.45 for both phones.  Not a great experience.

5289,B08PCDP3LM,2,"
Not satisfied, With ...Good Condition ! Had a lot of scratches on the glass of the screen and one greater on the side , alu frame of the screen. Not satisfied !
"
5290,B08PCDP3LM,2,"
I purchased an “excellent condition iPhone 12 pro” but the phones battery health on the phone is only 80% which means the phone has been used a lot beforehand. Doesn’t seem excellent to me.
"
5291,B08PCDP3LM,1,"
I purchased this iPhone for my daughters 18th birthday, so it was important for me  to have a phone that looked new. I read the description of a phone rated “excellent condition” and it says screen - no scratches, body - no scratches or dents. Please look at the photos of what I received!! There is a crack in the corner and the screen was covered in scratches, the previous owner clearly hadn’t used a screen protector as my very old iphone 6’s screen is in much better condition. Amazon also had to help me out as the seller doesn’t pay for returns so I have had to pay for the return myself and send a photo of my receipt to Amazon who will refund postage for me. The refund for the phone will take 5-7 days so it means I won’t have my refund quick enough to source another one in time for my daughters birthday. It’s been a bit of a nightmare! The seller needs to be honest with their description as it causes a lot of disappointment and hassle otherwise.
"
5292,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
Arrive late but through no fault of the seller ( Royal Mail strike )  the iPhone is in excellent condition as described by seller no problem at all
"
5293,B08PCDP3LM,4,"
The phone is in very good condition, has no scratches or chips at all.I was worried due to some of the other reviews.The battery health is at 86% which is fine for a phone that has potentially been used for a year or so already.
"
5294,B08PCDP3LM,1,"
Still appalling value for money, even second hand, they cost mere pounds to make in volume. Price does not reflect intrinsic value, rather what consumers are prepared to pay, and these days they are prepared to pay what Apple tell them to pay. Economics of capitalism. Go research.Cameras are below market average, whatever the reassuring advertising says, it's just words. All the grand images and videos Apple show in their hype ads are created through software rendering. You can get results like these, and better, from any image source using any editing software, even the free ones. Won't be using these for my professional photographic needs, got a 108 megapixel snapper on another brand for that, the difference really does show.Pleased with handset, perfect except for one small mark on bezel. Battery appears okay, but then the phone is only a year old. Some older models I've recently bought (7 and 8 series) needed replacements (easy to do yourself).Will be used as an iPod, not a phone, iTunes is only music player that plays back mix albums without those tiny gaps between tracks, one thing Apple have always got right. On downside, playlists can occasionally cause problems, some won't switch off and can only be deleted via PC, others cause track title/band display errors, especially with mp3s not bought through Apple, but this is a minor niggle, gaplesss playback is why I bought this, that's probably Apple's crowning achievement. When you've gone Android for your phone needs, you don't go back.Had to buy the 256 GB model, not the 128, because iOS generates a permanent massive ""cache"" file in use, up to 10gb, which means this chunk of memory storage can't be used for user files, it's a niggle that's been on iPhones since early days and Apple haven't rectified it, probably think they don't need to, blame it on their customers as usual. It used to be part of the ""system files"" when you check storage use in general settings, now it has its own entry, so at least now you can check how much of your phone's memory storage is unavailable. It's a huge chunk.Lastly, don't buy from Loop Mobile, they aren't nice people to deal with and won't accept you cancelling an order one even if it is only an hour after placing

I was initially unsure about buying a ‘renewed’ iPhone 12 from Amazon and the vendor, Phones Direct uk only had a few ratings but all 100% positive. I went for it and couldn’t be happier (and relived) when it arrived. Quick delivery, well packaged and the phone looked brand new other than not having the protective film on the screen. As it was a ‘renewed’ product I probably spent extra time trying my hardest to find imperfections, tiny scratches etc but couldn’t find a thing, perfect condition. Not sure the plug and charging cable are original but they work as well as my existing apple cable and plug. The quick start guide included is a Phones Direct uk guide rather than an apple one but it was all I needed (the phone does it all for you). Been using the phone for a while and all working as expected. It comes with a 12 month Amazon renewed warranty so still have the same piece of mind as a new phone. Based on my experience, I would buy a renewed product from Phones Direct Uk again.

5304,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
Ordered this phone because I tried repairing my phone myself, and it went horribly wrong.. so came onto Amazon and came across this product. I was a bit reluctant because I’ve never ordered a renewed phone, but there was no difference compared to a brand new iphone! No scratches, no damages, and a lot cheaper than ordering a brand new one. Everything works great! It even came with a charger and a plug whereas a brand new iPhone 12 Pro doesn’t come with a plug. Would highly recommend this!

Originally bought this as a mistake instead of Pro Max, immediately contacted seller after buying it but they didn’t respond and sent the item anyway. I decided to keep it as I needed a phone ASAP. 2 weeks in and the battery only lasts a few hours, and now the Face ID isn’t working properly. Seller still won’t respond.

Iphone 12 Pro came in excellent condition, no scratches, battery is at 89% health. I have no complaints and would definitely buy again from this seller. Delivery made as promised, not in original package, but safe and secure nonetheless. Came with brand new USB to Lightning cable.
"
5313,B08PCDP3LM,3,"
Battery 89,acceptable.But there are scratches which cannot be ignored on the screen and the back,contacted the seller several times and didn’t get the reply.It’s worth the price but it looks absolutely not new.Whatever,it will have the scratches in several weeks after all,and the price was low.这价格还要啥自行车 哈哈哈哈哈
"
5314,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
I was worried about buying a refurbished phone  but took the gamble. It came in two days signed delivery in a non descript white box. The phone was in a sealable bag, with a charging cable (no headphones or plug). The phone was immaculate in every way. The battery life was 89% but must be expected considering the discount in price.I’ve had my IPhone 12 Pro over a month now with no issues or problems. Highly recommend.

iPhone like new in great condition not a scratch or mark on screen or body. Works perfectly had no problems in setting it up and importing settings from my old iPhone 7. Was a bit worried about face recognition but easy to set up and no probs in use. Camera takes good clear pics. Battery life is good fantastic in comparison to old phone. To sum up very pleased with my purchase.
"
5317,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
So I was really reluctant spending a lot of money on a second hand phone, but safe to say I’m very relieved and actually really happy. I’d say if 100% was a brand new phone, I would say 95%. The tiniest of mark on the screen and that’s it. Which I expected more than that with it being second hand!! And battery health is 94%. Again, what I’d expect with it being second hand. So overall, very pleased and luckily for me worth the risk.
"
5318,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
Scratch free, excellent battery, and half the price. For a year old phone!

The phone arrived in a foam padded box, with sim tool and charger. The battery health is 100% out of the box and is in pristine condition. There are no surface imperfections whatsoever.The phone functions as if new including facial recognition and cameras.Great value for money. Would recommend.

I was hoping that all the bad review of loop mobile were just some angry client, instead I’ve to say that they were absolutely true LOOP MOBILE let me down big times I bought this iPhone 12 Pro that should have been renewed, when instead The description of the product is completely false, was stating that should be an item that is renewed, when instead the item is just used, not even cleaned, it came with the lcd all scratched, not any kind of protection on top, I wasn’t expecting a protection glass on top but at the very least a kind of film on top of the lcd, the phone was all dirty, and the scratches visible from more than not just 30cm you can see them with your eyes closed, customer service very poor, I had to go through amazon customer service to have any kind of help, and even there just a refund, I needed the phone not something that I’ve to send back and revive the money after another week, absolutely unhappy, be careful to do not order fromLoop mobile if you getting a renewed phone, but get it from the other seller, that instead has very very good reviews, do not make my same error guys…!
"
5323,B08PCDP3LM,5,"

I ordered this and only the charger and the sim came with it. They’re saying I’m not eligible for a refund. What the hell? I’ve been saving up for this and this happens this is why i do not order cheap stuff do not order from here save your money somewhere else.

The first one I received has some scratches on the screen so I return it. The second one (different seller) is spotless, perfect conditions, 2 small scratches on the frame but not impacting screen. Battery life 87%. Really worth the money.
"
5327,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
As with a lot of people I was a bit unsure about buying a refurbished phone, especially when you don't know how it's going to arrive, however I have to say I'm nothing but impressed!No noticeable cosmetic damage, battery health at 99%, it may as well have come factory fresh at this point! Would definitely recommend, especially given the price.

You wouldn’t know that this phone is used at all. There’s not a single scratch on it, works really well. The only way I know this is used is that the battery health is 94% - but I’m still really happy and would definitely buy a refurbished phone again.
"
5338,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
Great value for money. Reconditioned phone arrived ahead of time. Phone looks perfect. Transfer from old iPhone was extremely easy.  I saved a lot of money as against buying a brand new 13 & this does everything for me. Great service from this seller.

The worst seller I have dealt with when it comes to warranty and repairs. I have brought a phone which has 1 year warranty. This seller messed me about so much and never fixed it. I sent it to them 2 times at my own cost. They’re a waste of time and the communication is so poor. It’s like talking to a brick wall and it’ll get you nowhere. Never again will I use them. Avoid at all costs.

The phone provide by Loop-Mobile, I have received is at best described as fair/good standard. It works fine but the cosmetics are damaged on the upper areas of the metal body all around the phone. The phone also arrived dirty, especially around speaker at the bottom of the phone and around volume controls and the camera lens. All easily cleanable but you’d expect the phone to arrive clean if been through their quality control as described. I have requested a refund. I would add that you should check which company you are ordering from as they don’t all come from same one and I’m sure others will be fine.

Definitely the best renewed product I’ve ever bought!!!
"
5376,B08PCDP3LM,1,"
The first phone sent had a major hardware problem as confirmed by diagnostics at an Apple Store. i thought that was just bad luck so did a return and ordered another. that arrived from a different supplier with a screen with scratch so obvious a blind person could have felt it. Just want off and bought a new phone after this. Less hassle.

5378,B08PCDP3LM,1,"
Ordered a Renewed iPhone 12 Pro 256GB - when it arrived the screen was covered in scratches and was not in a like-new condition.The device was fully working but when you order a like-new phone you do not expect multiple scratches on the screen.

5379,B08PCDP3LM,1,"
Arrived in a condition that didn’t match the description. Chipped screen, gouge down glass.Trying to return but not had a label to post back
"
5380,B08PCDP3LM,1,"
Not as it’s made out. Scratches around the side of the phone. Really disappointed. Waiting to get this resolved. Not as described- I know it’s refurbishes but it definitely not worth it

Very disappointed with the quality. Advertised as cleaned and as new but was not. Very dirty and had marks. Customer service was extremely poor too. Would not recommend this seller. What a disappointing experience!!!!
"
5386,B08PCDP3LM,1,"
They sell the item saying that “it looks and works as new” but the screen is full of visible scratches. Also, there is a little dent on one of the corners.
"
5387,B08PCDP3LM,1,"
the phone it's great but the battery not great i charge the phone almost an hour but still on 47% so the battery not great

I ordered an iPhone 12 pro but got a simple iPhone 12
"
5390,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
Was abit apprehensive about a second hand phone. Arrived in good condition, tiny scratch on the corner but not visible. Daughter likes it as an upgrade from iPhone 7. The battery lasts long and face recognition is brilliant as she forgets passwords most of the time.Overall the phone works great
"
5391,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
This phone was received in excellent condition. Looks absolutely new. Had it for ten days now and so happy with this purchase so far. Very long battery life and extremely suitable for my needs.
"
5392,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
The only flaw is that the battery (although I knew that refurbished ones don't have 100% working battery) sometimes gets discharged earlier and earlier. I bought it two months ago and at the beginning it was perfect, now I feel that the battery is struggling to recharge.Otherwise, perfect... like new!
"
5393,B08PCDP3LM,3,"
Great phone physically but the refresh rate is very slow on most iPhones nothing to do with the seller who is good amen

"

I think I got lucky or something, since I got a spotless phone with absolutely no scratches. Very happy with the purchase. Thanks

IPhone arrived without any marks or scuffs. You can't find any fault with the usability. Battery is 100%. Face id works like a charm. I highly recommend this seller to anyone looking to buy. Delivered in 2 days. Overall I'm completely impressed!
"
5401,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
The phone is in mint condition, no issues whatsoever, not even a tiny scratch. I have got the gold one, 128GB for a very good price and it was delivered in a couple of days The box is not Apple original, nor is the charger, but its no big deal considering is not brand new. Would definitely recommend this buy.
"

Really good quality and even came with a genuine box!

5403,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
I love everything in it !!!!

For a refurb phone. It’s great. Battery life is at 97%. I was expecting at least 84% so very happy with this. 👍🏾

5405,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
I ordered it for my partner and he is quite happy with that! Thank you very much!
"
5406,B08PCDP3LM,4,"
The phone was in perfect condition it’s just the battery health was too low for my liking Was at 83% messaged the seller and he was happy to give me a refund once I’ve returned everything back which was great. Received the refund within few days after returning
"
5407,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
It’s a good product delivery service is very discreet, so I am pleased with it
"
5408,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
I was more concern over ordering renewed product wether it will be an original or will have no warranty, because of Amazon backed 1 year warranty I chose to go ahead. I received a phone in prestine condition (just as new), no wear and tear no scratches just as new. No one can differentiate wether it's a new or renewed. I got 10 months apple warranty remaining on the product. I got mobile in custom box not the apple branded. In the box I got mobile phone, charging cable, No charger included.I am using the phone and have faced no issues at all.
"
5409,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
To be honest, I was a little sceptical about purchasing a phone that appeared to be around 1/3 it's retail price. I've heard the horror stories about people opening their non-Apple certified gadgets and witnessing them crash and burn before their own eyes.The reviews where largely hit or miss, seemed like almost a gamble. You could either end up with a superior find, with beautiful customer servicing - or you could end up with some cranky leftover that isn't worth pennies and peanuts, from a foreign guy over the phone who refuses to give your money back.I'm happy to say that I belong to the former. Upon receiving the phone I find that it works just as intended. No (noticeable) cosmetic or functional damage, no problem switching my SIM card over, and while the battery capacity (86%) isn't exactly something to obsess over, the actual experience of using and charging it feels as if it just came fresh out the Apple Store.  Would definitely recommend this seller and this phone, especially for its price vs retail. However, mind you, make sure you purchase one that's in Excellent condition - I cannot reprimand or tell you about products of a lower grade, and nor can you expect much if it arrives as broken as a lot of these reviewers learnt the hard way. On that end, be sure to know your options if such happens.
"
5410,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
I couldn’t be happier with my renewed iPhone. It’s the first time I have bought renewed and I’m  really impressed: phone looks and operates as brand new, at a fraction of the price. Reuse upgrade is better for the planet too. Max battery capacity reads as 95% but can easily last 48hrs with my usage. Delivered on time in quality protective packaging.
"
5411,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
IPhone 12 works fine as advertised
"
5412,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
The phone arrived super quickly. It is in a great condition (super minor scratches can be seen only if you look very closely). It works perfectly well, the battery has 93% of capacity.Overall I am very pleased with my purchase.
"
5413,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
My iPhone X was giving up on me so I thought it was time for an upgrade. This phone is amazing, loads of new features and looks great too. Would recommend
"
5414,B08PCDP3LM,4,"
There is a lot of dust and dirt on the handset and charging port of the mobile phone. I used a brush to clean them up carefully, and the battery is a little old, which is normal and acceptable. After all, this is a second-hand product, and other aspects are still okay.
"
5415,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
Packaging for the two iphones was very disappointing. both phones wrapped together in bubble wrap and in a flimsy carton which was not much bigger than the phones. However, the phones themselves were in great condition with no visible damage. About 6 weeks since purchase and all going well.
"
5416,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
Like new, no issues, its an iPhone.

iPhone è arrivato in condizioni eccellenti sono soddisfatto La batteria e perfetta e le condizioni del cellulari veramente eccellenti. Posso dire come nuovo.
"
5418,B08PCDP3LM,4,"
Arrivato con un giorno di anticipo, il cellulare è esteticamente e funzionalmente perfetto, nessun graffio nè altri segni di uso neanche cercando con una lente d'ingrandimento. Non mi è piaciuta la confezione per via della protezione morbida che perdeva pelucchi e c'è voluto tempo prima di pulirlo bene per applicare il vetro protettivo (comprato a parte). La vera pecca però è la batteria il cui stato è 84% quindi prossima alla sostituzione.
"
5419,B08PCDP3LM,4,"
Sono molto contentx, grazie. Il materiale è molto moderno e anche il design. Sono passato da Android a Apple e posso dire che ne sono contento. Il passaggio era un po‘ faticoso ma è andato tutto a buon fine e anche la spedizione era molto veloce👍
"
5420,B08PCDP3LM,4,"
Funzionalità perfetta. Batteria perfetta. Schermo intatto. Piccole tacche da probabile caduta sul margine della cornice (più di una). Tolgo quindi una stella perché non lo considero di prima scelta ma di condizioni accettabili. Mi va bene così ma non sono stato avvertito prima. Imballo inesistente scatolina di cartone in busta gialla pluriboll.  Consegna senza dover firmare.
"
5421,B08PCDP3LM,4,"
TELEFONO OK , BATTERIA ALL'86% PERO' TUTTO OK. PER IL MOMENTO CONSIGLIO VENDITORE. FARò ALTRI ACQUISTI IN FUTURO E VALUTERò NUOVAMENTE. SPERO POSITIVAMENTE
"
5422,B08PCDP3LM,4,"
Arrivato prima del previsto il telefono è esteticamente in condizioni eccellenti, come da descrizione, peccato che la batteria invece è all’87%, mi sarei aspettato una percentuale almeno sopra il 90%.
"
5423,B08PCDP3LM,4,"
Ho acquistato iPhone 12 pro in stato eccellente…telefono arrivato perfetto pari a nuovo non si direbbe che è un ricondizionato …L unica pecca è la batteria con vita all 83%..x essere pari a nuovo è un po’ poca xo posso dire che è attiva la applecare plus ancora in garanzia..per quanto riguarda il corriere è arrivato con due giorni di anticipo rispetto alla data indicata …ho richiesto la fattura e in meno di due ore mi è stata inviata tramite mail…lo comsiglio
"
5424,B08PCDP3LM,4,"
Ho comprato il dispositivo in “condizioni eccellenti” e sinceramente non mi aspettavo tanti segni di usura come quelli che ho trovato sugli angoli e bordi del telefono, più un segno sul vetro. Quindi tolgo una stella, ma solo una perché comunque sono cose che con cover e vetro di protezione non si notano. Per il resto il telefono è una bomba, la batteria un po’ meno, è all’88% e non dura tutta la giornata. Se penso però che nuovo costa 1200€, più o meno, e che l’ho pagato circa 750€ va benissimo così.
"
5425,B08PCDP3LM,4,"
Alors l’état rien a dire super état ; le chargeur par contre pas top première génération… l’état de la batterie 83% par contre il faut pas appeler sa excellent état je trouve ça vraiment pas top pour le prix
"
5426,B08PCDP3LM,4,"
Malgrado abbia contattato il venditore chiedendo una verifica della batteria prima della spedizione e mi sia proposta di pagare una differenza per un nuovo acquisto, anche in altro colore, di un prodotto migliore, l'iphone è arrivato con batteria solo al 86%. Lo provo un paio di giorni e valuto il reso
"
5427,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
Ritengo che oggi sia fondamentale riciclare il più possibile...ì cellulari ricondizionati rispettano l'ambiente e permettono a chi acquista di risparmiare molto. Sono soddisfatta dell'acquisto che ho però scelto cercando ricondizionato in OTTIME CONDIZIONI. Esteticamente non ha un difetto e per ora anche il suo funzionamento è perfetto.
"
5428,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
Sono pienamente soddisfatto, nessun problema. Anzi… la batteria originale Apple nuova (100%) nessun graffio… Un ringraziamento va al venditore.Avrei, forse potuto aspettare ancora un po’ … il prezzo probabilmente sarebbe calato. Ma va bene così… per un prodotto ricondizionato… - da quello che sento e leggo in giro - Ripeto Non posso assolutamente lamentarmi.

 Esteticamente impeccabile.Visto che ho scelto un prodotto dalle condizioni “eccellenti” mi aspettavo una percentuale di batteria più alta almeno superiore al 90% mentre la batteria attualmente misura circa 83%. Scalda un po’ quando è sotto carica ma forse quello credo sia una caratteristica del del telefono.

Prima volta che acquisto smartphone di fascia alta ricondizionati:- il telefono si presenta in un imballo Phonem ben fatto, eccezion fatta per la protezione dello schermo totalmente assente in quanto esposto completamente a urti sul lato superiore frontale della scatola;- presenta minuscole imperfezioni appena visibili, quindi prodotto eccellente.Lo sto usando da qualche giorno e sembra tutto perfetto: edizione USA con antenna 5G laterale, per ora funzionante in tutto e per tutto.Giudizio generale ottimo, ma le uniche due pecche, per le quali non mi sento di fornire 5 stelle (specificatamente per il secondo punto), sono le seguenti:- Batteria al 88% della capacità massima, ma comunque entro i limiti del 80% minimo, ma mi sarei aspettato di meglio;- Alimentatore e cavo sono di bassissima fattura  (brandizzati Phonem) e per giunta nemmeno a carica rapida.Per questo secondo punto la questione è alquanto deludente in quanto la quasi totalità degli altri clienti hanno trovato, pur se non originali ma nei limiti di vendita, alimentatori da almeno 20W e cavi USB-C to Lightning, adatti ad un telefono di questo livello, e non capisco per quale motivo nel mio caso siano stati rimpiazzati da questi, tra l’altro inadatti e poco funzionali, obbligandomi a dover temporaneamente usare il vecchio alimentatore e cavo originali del mio iPhone 7 in attesa di ricevere, con altri soldi spesi, alimentatore e cavo nuovi ordinati il giorno stesso.  Consiglierei di rivedere gli accessori obbligatori per telefoni di questa fascia e di mettere in armonia i prezzi sui diversi canali nei quali vendete, per prodotti identici in modello, grado, capacità e colore. Non aggiungo altro.Mi riservo di rivedere la recensione.Giudizio generale ottimo ma non eccellente, venditore più che consigliato.

Ich habe das iPhone 12 Pro in Graphit mit ausgezeichneten Zustand gekauft das iPhone ist aus den USA erkennbar anhand der Antenne die es hier in Europa nicht gibt aber das ist egal sollte nur gesagt sein. Der Ramen ist fast komplett drum rum mit leichten Kratzern versehen was mich persönlich nicht stört da ich es in einer Hülle benutze die Rückseite ist markellos also perfekt. Der einzigste richte Kritikpunkt ist der Akku mit einer Kapazität von nur 88% daher muss ich den Akku bei Apple für 75 Euro selbst wechseln lassen behalte das Gerät trotzdem an sich ein gutes iPhone für den preis.

Compré este terminal hace dos días. Me llegó en 24 horas por DHL. Al principio lo compré con cierta reticencia al no ser enviado por Amazon y no leer precisamente buenas críticas de este vendedor. Admito que me la jugué, y todo por ahorrar, pero pensé, si sale mal el experimento, siempre tengo la opción de devolverlo gracias a la garantía de Amazon. Decir que en este caso acerté, el teléfono vino en estado impoluto (lo elegí dentro de la categoría excelente). Eso sí, la batería me vino con el 86% de salud. Me hubiera gustado un porcentaje más alto, pero está dentro de lo que prometen. En resumen, en mi caso, sí que recomiendo comprar terminales reacondicionados de Amazon. Espero que a alguien le haya servido de ayuda este comentario. Un saludo a tod@s y bona nit 😉

J'ai reçu le smartphone hier et j'ai été surprise agréablement en voyant l'aspect extérieur en excellent état ! Aucune rayures. Quelques traces de doigts seulement. En revanche l'état de la batterie 88% je suis moyennement contente. Ce qui m'a le plus déçu et franchement c'est abusé, un chargeur de 1ere génération !!! J'ai mis en charge hier le iphone car quasi plus de batterie quand je l'ai reçu, il a charger pendant 3h pour être à 100%, non mais sérieux, le vendeur aurait pu mettre un nouveau chargeur. En plus je n'ai pas reçu les écouteurs donc dégoûtée.

Sono veramente sorpreso dalla qualità del prodotto: Iphone nuovissimo, non ha neanche un graffietto. Lo stato della batteria è al 100% (sicuramente la terrò sotto controllo in questi mesi ma, se non aggiornerò la recensione, è perché non necessita di aggiornamenti). I venditori sono stati gentilissimi nel rispondermi subito circa un piccolo ritardo dovuto alla settimana del Black Friday. Il prodotto era inoltre ben sigillato, dotato anche di carica batterie. Non potevo farmi un regalo di Natale migliore!

Das IPhone ist in einen optisch exzellenten Zustand. Besser sogar als erwartet und damit von einem neuen nicht zu unterscheiden.

Tutto molto bello, ma pagare 700€ e passa un telefono che dovrebbe essere in ottime condizioni ma con un graffione evidente sul display mi fa rodere parecchio. Inizialmente mi sembrava essere sulla pellicola, ma dopo averla sostituita con un’altra ho capito fosse sul vetro.Sarebbe stato il caso di segnalarlo considerando che è un difetto che si nota anche a più di 30cm di distanza. Ci sarebbe da dire che la fotocamera interna faccia pensare che non sia un iPhone, ovviamente lascia a desiderare. Il resto tutto ok, qualche altro piccolo difetto estetico ma passabile; batteria in buone condizioni.Non sono molto soddisfatta e ovviamente mi asterrò da fare acquisti in futuro da questo venditore.

A primera vista todo parece en buen estado, pero a la que empiezas a fijarte vas encontrando ralladas en la pantalla.El dispositivo viene sin limpiar… en mi caso tenía pegamento en el marco del teléfono.A los días he visto que la batería se gastaba con rapidez, con un uso mediano no podía llegar a las 10h, en mi caso ha llegado con un 86% de salud de batería a los días ha bajado 84%, la verdad a no ser que queráis 1 año de garantía o similar os recomiendo que busquéis uno en Wallapop que seguramente costará menos i tendrá un mejor estado que el “reacondicionado” o prepararos para gastar 75€ en una nueva batería.

Bon produit, en très bel état (comme neuf sincèrement), pas une seule rayure visible.Attention par contre assez trompeur, non reconditionné à neuf, état « excellent » comme mentionné dans l’annonce mais pas neuf.

Lo que me ha gustado es el estado del celular en general. Tiene micro rayaduras pero casi invisibles, normales del uso. La pantalla es original.Lo único malo, es que la batería vino en un 79% y ya aparece el mensaje de que se tiene que cambiar. Es una pena que la compañía no haga en control necesario antes de enviar estos aparatos y prometiendo que la salud de la batería sería mayor al 80%

Ho acquistato l’iPhone ricondizionato ma pagato per condizioni eccellenti, lo stesso non rispecchia le specifiche Amazon infatti si riscontrano sul display dei piccoli segni(lievi ma ci sono) e un segno tipo scheggiato al bordo tra cornice è display… la batteria e all’88% di capacità…non molto soddisfatto dell’acquisto.

Comprato questo iPhone ricondizionato un po’ scettico sulle condizioni estetiche e funzionali.Per fortuna mi sbagliavo, il telefono sembra nuovo e mi ha fatto fare un ottima figura essendo un regalo.

Premetto che è la prima volta in vita mia che compro un device ricondizionato perché sono abbastanza maniacale sulle mie cose. Ma data la situazione per cui mi serviva questo iphone sono stato disposto a qualche compromesso.Lo stato generale del telefono è più che buono. È arrivato senza la scatola originale ed imballato nella plastica antiurto dentro un pacchetto DHL assicurato.- Packaging non ci siamo proprio! - Capisco che si tratta di un ricondizionato ma un minimo di attenzione per uno smartphone di questa fascia credo ci voglia (ma questo è solo un consiglio per il venditore).Venendo al succo:Estetica ok!Ci sono dei graffietti qua e là, come si vede dalle immagini ma si tratta di graffi di utilizzo, probabilmente è stato esposto (ribadisco, io li noto perché in telefoni che uso quotidianamente da 3/4 anni quei graffi non ci sono ma per qualcuno potrebbero essere graffi fatti in poche settimane di utilizzo).Probabilmente il graffio sulla parte esterna del monitor (vicino allo slot della sim) è il peggiore, più profondo degli altri, probabilmente una caduta senza cover.La cosa peggiore è quella macchia in basso. Dalle foto si vede poco, non si tratta di un riflesso o di una ""ditata"" come potrebbe sembrare. Credo sia stata rovinata la scocca con qualche tipo di abrasione, forse con qualche prodotto che ha tolto il colore. Questo è piuttosto fastidioso ed è una delle motivazioni che mi fa dare 3 stelle.L'altra cosa che terrò sotto controllo è la batteria.Non appena arrivato ho fatto un controllo generale notando che la batteria era al 99% del suo stato di utilizzo.""Wow ho pensato, praticamente nuova!""Mentre scrivo lo sto utilizzando da due settimane e la batteria è scesa al 96% (con una ricarica al giorno).Questa cosa non è proprio normale, non vorrei che nel processo di ricondizionamento sia stata usata una batteria poco adeguata o fallata.Monitorerò la cosa e magari aggiornerò la recensione (se non mi sentite la cosa si è fermata la) ;-)

Cet iPhone 12 Pro reconditionné est impeccable, on le croirait neuf, seule la capacité de la batterie à 91% indique un smartphone d'occasion.  Tout fonctionne de manière fluide, la mise à jour sur iOS 16.1 n'a pas posé de souci et il tient la charge toute la journée - mais je ne joue pas en ligne et je ne regarde pas de séries.  Le bleu pacifique est superbe !10/10 pour le vendeur Certicom en Espagne.  J'ai reçu mon iPhone avant la date prévue dans une boîte blanche générique avec un câble et un chargeur MFI : plus qu'Apple ne fournit ces jours-ci !  J'ai malgré tout acheté un chargeur rapide 20W et un câble Lightning, tous les deux Apple, sur Amazon Warehouse.Bizarre quand même que le livreur (Colis Privé) mette le colis dans la boîte à lettres sans signature, ce n'est pas trop sécurisé...

Arrivato in una scatola anonima con una pellicola di vetro, cover, caricatore e cavetto nuovi (non originali), il prodotto è buono, schermo e retro perfetti, ha solo dei segni di usura (piccoli graffi) sui bordi in acciaio. Il mio è il modello americano, quello con l’antenna 5g per le onde millimetriche, la batteria ha l’89% di capacità, uniche pecche più fastidiose secondo me, è il fatto che un pulsante del volume sia un po’ più “rientrato” rispetto all’altro, le griglie in basso per speaker e microfono non sembrano state riassemblate correttamente (sono un po’ troppo rientrate) e lo schermo nel lato in basso a destra è un po’ scollato, quindi non mi sento di poterlo immergere in acqua con molta sicurezza, per il resto tutto buono

Il device funziona alla perfezione ed a prima vista esteticamente è ineccepibile, anche la batteria risulta pari al nuovo.Guardando con un pizzico di attenzione in più la qualità non è proprio eccellente, ho trovato dei segni sul bordo anteriore dello smart-watch, niente di particolarmente grave, ma la cosa che più si evidenzia è che sull'oggetto che mi è arrivato risulta perfettamente visibile che è stato sostituito il vetro anteriore, in controluce e in condizioni di scarso contrasto a schermo spento, si vede perfettamente come la riparazione non sia stata effettuata in modo professionale. La colla che si stende fra vetro e touch screen non è stata stesa alla perfezione e non copre tutto lo schermo, i risultato è che si vedono i contorni della colla, è vero che si notano solo in determinate condizioni, ma si notano e questo va in contrasto con la descrizione che viene fornita al momento della ricerca. Non è in eccellenti condizioni ma direi più in buone condizioni, detto questo per il resto niente da dire sia per la consegna sia per l'imballaggio e tanto meno sul perfetto funzionamento. Peccato per quel difettuccio che un po rovina il giudizio. Non so se a questo punto lo terrò, valuterò nei prossimi giorni quanto questa cosa mi rimane per la gola.

Looked like it was taken directly out of someone's phone case, and not cleaned.I was expecting a lot better for seven hundred Euro.You know, with a little effort, stainless steel can be polished, to get rid of scratches.Man, I really don't like leaving negative reviews.I was buying this for one of the Ukrainian children living with me.I would have been embarrassed giving this phone to her.I'll give it two stars, since a phone was actually delivered to me.I immediately returned this phone.Bought a new iPhone 13 instead.This was my first experience with a refurbished phone.I 'd be very reluctant to buy a refurbished phone again.I'm giving five stars for the screen and storage, not having seen either, I trust that they were as described.In addition to this refurbished phone that I returned, I also bought an Apple iPhone 12 Pro, 128GB from Swappie.For the same price, it is like a brand new phone - in immaculate condition.Oh, and I'm still waiting for my refund from Ava Direct.I suppose I'll get it, some day...

El teléfono lo envío ciclozero, no creo que vuelva a comprar un reacondicionado, al meno de esta marca. Por lo demás genial, el cargador es “chino” y el cable parece original.

Nulla da dire riguardo al telefono che è pari al nuovo, tutto perfettamente funzionante, batteria al 99% e zero graffi o imperfezioni.Riguardo alla spedizione però, purtroppo, mi sono trovata davvero male. Non mi aspettavo la confezione originale apple in quanto in descrizione era scritto che sarebbe stato consegnato in una scatola anonima, però non mi aspettavo neanche di trovarmi, una volta aperto il pacco, il telefono già acceso e quasi scarico avvolto solo da una busta di plastica e dall’imballaggio sempre in plastica. Nessuna scatolina anonima come promesso dalla descrizione e anche il caricatore avvolto da una plastica sottile.Ad ogni modo il telefono funziona e pare non aver subito danni in seguito all’evidente carenza di un imballaggio come si deve.

Gekauft als generalüberholt. Gerät schaut brandneu aus, wie frisch vom Band gefallen: keinerlei Kratzer, Macken oder ähnliches! Wer braucht da noch neu kaufen?!Für mich persönlich war das 12 Pro jedoch leider zu groß und zu schwer. 1-Hand-Bedienung oft schwierig und in der Hosentasche hat man das Gerät deutlich gespürt. Des weiteren wirkt meiner Meinung nach das 12er (& 13er) Modell aufgrund des eckigen (Retro-) Designs dicker und unergonomischer als z.B. ein 11er Modell mit den abgerundeten Ecken. Gerät wurde deshalb umgetauscht. Rückabwicklung ohne Probleme!

Il telefono è pari al nuovo in condizioni perfette, arrivato con gls in una confezione improvvisata ma ben protetto. Il venditore ha aggiunto un carica batterie di iPhone X e precedenti in più la spilletta togli sim. L’iPhone è il modello americano perché presenta l’antenna supplementare per il 5G necessaria per gli Stati Uniti d’America che si trova sul lato destro del telefono. Per questo il prezzo è più conveniente ma ripeto il telefono è pari al nuovo è solo una questione estetica che può interessare come no. Comunque venditore con ottimi prodotti ma deludente per quanto riguarda l’assistenza. Avevo mandato un paio di mail per la tracciabilita del pacco e non ho mai avuto risposta. Anche sul numero di cellulare ho mandato un messaggio whatsapp che ancora non riceve, ho anche provato a chiamare ma era sempre spento. Ma a me interessa che il telefono funzioni e che sia in ottimo stato.  Comunque Incrocio le dita e darò notizie in seguito.

Ho acquistato un Iphone 12 proPensavo acquistando un prodotto ricondizionato che avesse qualche imperfezione, invece zero, nessuna, il prodotto è pari al nuovo. Arrivato in tre giorni, buona confezione, pacchetto con logo ""loop"", dentro caricabatterie e chiavetta per sim, oltre le istruzioni. L'ho portato a mettere la cover ed il venditore si è complimentato per lo stato del cellulare. Che dire fa foto splendide, il riconoscimento facciale è perfetto per l'home banking e per le altre app, la velocità è portentosa, il suono anche. Un consiglio anche se condizionato scegliete il venditore e non badate a risparmiare. C'è sempre il detto di chi più spende, meglio spende.

Diese Rezension beschreibt NICHT das iPhone 12, sondern den Kauf bei ""Amazon Renewed""/""Mobihub.de"".LieferungDie Lieferung wurde nach zwei Tagen zugestellt. Neben dem iPhone lagen noch ein No Name-Ladegerät und eine Sim-Nadel im Paket. OVP und die originalen Apple Zubehöre waren - wie in der Artikelbeschreibung erwähnt - nicht enthalten.Äußerer ZustandDer äußere Zustand des iPhones entsprach ebenfalls der Artikelbeschreibung: aus 30 Zentimeter Entfernung waren überhaupt keine Gebrauchsspuren erkennbar. Selbst bei genauer Betrachtung erwiesen sich alle Oberflächen als makellos. Das möchte ich extra hervorheben: Das Gerät ist ziemlich genau ein Jahr alt und hat trotzdem eine neuwertige Optik.Die Schalter/Taster am Gehäuse sind ebenso in Ordnung. Einziger kleiner Schwachpunkt: Der Lautlos-Schalter ist sehr schwergängig. Es wirkt, als ob im Inneren des Schalters fest gebackener Staub wäre. Die Funktionalität ist dadurch jedoch nicht eingeschränkt. Man kann den Schalter halt nicht ""so nebenbei"" betätigen, sondern muss sich darauf konzentrieren und die Rückmeldung am Display kontrollieren.TechnikDas iPhone war auf Werkseinstellungen zurückgesetzt und konnte problemlos gestartet/installiert werden.Im Betrieb treten keinerlei Fehlfunktionen auf.Der Akku ist bei akzeptablen 89 %. Das liegt im Korridor der Artikelbeschreibung (""über 80 %""). Es lässt aber auch auf eine intensive Nutzung im ersten Lebensjahr schließen.FazitBei Renewed/Refurbished-Angeboten ist natürlich keine allgemeine Aussage möglich, da sich jedes Exemplar vom anderen unterscheiden kann.Für ""mein"" iPhone kann ich sagen: bisher ein Kauf ohne Reue. Das Produkt entspricht der Artikelbeschreibung. Es gibt keinen Anlass zu Kritik.Und sollte doch noch ein Fehler auftauchen, würde die Garantie von 12 Monaten greifen.

Il prodotto oltre ad avere qualche segno di usura (che comprendo possa avere in quanto ricondizionato) aveva delle macchie di grasso che potevano benissimo essere quantomeno tolte prima di metterlo in commercio.La cosa imperdonabile è sicuramente l'audio danneggiato. Ho ascoltato varie canzoni comparandolo con un'altra 12 pro e con il mio si sente distorto. Persino comprando la suoneria, nel mio caso si sente che non è pulita ma con una leggera distorsione. Per me che lavoro nel settore musicale è un guasto imperdonabileNon ha alcun senso acquistare un ricondizionato se poi non vengono fatti i test a dovere per sostituire parti danneggiate...Per questo richiederò il rimborsoPer questa ragione richiederò il rimborso

Prodotto rigenerato, consegnato in tempi celeri. Il prodotto si presenta in una scatola generica Loop, lo smartphone all’interno compreso di cavo e in uno scatolo separato il caricabatterie da 30w. Il telefono è in perfette condizioni estetiche, batteria al 98% (nel giro di qualche settimana scesa al 96%). Unica pecca, durante la prima configurazione ho notato con mio profondo dispiacere, una piccola, quasi impercettibile macchiolina nera nel lato basso/sinistro del display confinante con il bordo del display (sicuramente Pixel Bruciato). Non ho chiesto la sostituzione perché resterei a piedi(senza smartphone) e ne ho necessità per lavoro. Per me questo problema è un pugno in faccia perché da quando l’ho notato mi porta nervoso (mi cade l'occhio lì) visto la fiducia riposta è il prezzo pagato.

Tras estar bastante escéptico a comprar un iphone reacondicionado, me animé teniendo en cuenta la garantía de amazon y que en caso de que tuviera cualquier problema lo podía devolver y listo. Pues bien, el teléfono ha llegado en muy buena condición. Ningún rasguño en la carcasa y un pequeño arañazo casi imperceptible en la pantalla principal, que además viene cubierta de un protector. La salud de la batería está al 92%. La verdad es que para mí este punto es muy importante y un 92% para mí si es aceptable. Seguiré probándolo pero por ahora solo estoy teniendo buenas sensaciones y si todo sigue así me quedaré el dispositivo. Muy contento.

Modello destinato al mercato americano in quanto provvisto di modulo 5G mmWave che si può notare da una tacca appena percettibile al di sotto del pulsante di accensione, ma non sfruttabile in Italia (per ora).

Wie von Apple zu erwarten, hat dieses Telefon keinerlei Macken, hängt sich nie auf und sieht optisch (bis auf die gewöhnungsbedürftige Notch) nicht schlecht aus. Die Kameras funktionieren einwandfrei und während eines Videos kann es perfekt zwischen den verschiedenen Linsen wechseln, ohne das das Videomaterial darunter leidet. Da es das erste Apple iPhone für mich ist, muss ich mich noch von umständlichen Android hin zum einfach zu bedienenden Alleskönner umstellen. Der Batteriezustand ist leider nur bei 88% gewesen, aber er hält trotzdem den Tag durch.Klare Kaufempfehlung an dieser Stelle für das iPhone 12 Pro in der 128 GB Variante.Da ich leider keinen 5G-fähigen Vertrag habe, kann ich dazu nichts sagen, aber LTE /4G reicht für normale Zwecke vollkommen aus.

Tanti nuovi e diversi ricondizionati.Se si ragiona con calma e a sangue freddo si capisce che si può ottenere ottimo prodotto di modello precedente ( rispetto quello che si vende adesso) a un prezzo davvero interessante ( non regalato).Preso su Amazon e lo utilizzo da due mesi. Non vedo nessun minimo difetto, funziona perfettamente, batteria nuova e nessun graffio o segno di usura. Vi consiglio vivamente di considerare ricondizionato al posto del nuovo

Telefono bien, de momento funciona, salud de bateria por debajo del 85%, arañazos y cosas visibles en los bordes que tambien presentan un desgaste grande, la pantalla responde bien parece original. En unos meses actualizo.

il prodotto estetica mente molto bello, ma visto che e ricondizionato la prima volta mi e arrivato con dei componenti non riconosciuti dal sistema, la seconda volta mi e arrivato un iphone importato di conseguenza non compatibile con le frequenze italiane, dopo la seconda volta ho restituito il prodotto.il venditore e stato molto disponibile e cordiale

Destiné a remplacer un ancien Iphone. Les sensibles à l’ecologie peuvent être satisfaits et rassurés de cette pratique du reconditionnement. De l’excellent travail par le vendeur, et pour l’état demandé de la machine a l’exterieur et de la batterie. Bravo. Continuez. Je referai encore.

Compré el Iphone 12pro en condición supuestamente excelente por 809€ , Según la descripción y sus términos, no debería tener arañazos ni desperfectos estéticos en pantalla, laterales ni marcas visibles a 30cm de distancia, lo cual no se cumplió en ningún aspecto. Cabe decir que fue el único que rebajaron 100€ en 1semana y decían que era el último en stock, a pesar de que repusieron 1 o 2 más, sin embargo al pedir un cambio, me dijeron que no tenían ninguno en stock en esas condiciones. Para mi sorpresa, me encuentro lo que veis en las fotos. Un terminal en Condiciones satisfactorias y además me querían cobrar 12€ de envío para la devolución. Tuve que recurrir a Amazon y a las cláusulas de Amazon Renewed para llevar a cabo la devolución para recibir el reembolso integro.Experiencia muy mala...

Avevo bisogno di sostituire il mio iPhone 7 per via della memoria, attualmente di soli 32 GB.Scorro tra le offerte di Amazon e mi capita questo iPhone, nel formato da 512 GB, a 989 euro.Lo acquisto, forte della garanzia Amazon di un anno. Acquistato e spedito Venerdì, consegnato martedì mattina.Il telefono arriva in una confezione non originale, completo di cavo usb-c lightning, estrattore sim e, udite udite, caricatore usb-c da 30 watt.Il telefono è praticamente perfetto; ha solo una piccola ammaccatura nell’angolo inferiore sinistro, perfettamente camuffata dalla cover. Batteria al 91%, garanzia Apple fino al 8 gennaio 2022. Che altro chiedere di più? Personalmente nulla.Lo consiglio? Si, al 1000%

L'iPhone est arrivé rapidement, bien emballé et avec l'ensemble des accessoires (non-Apple mais fonctionnels). L'écran est impeccable, la tranche chromée et l'arrière de l'iPhone également. Aucune rayure. La face arrière dépasse légèrement du cadre, peut-être qu'elle a été remplacée et n'est pas d'origine ? Si c'est le cas j'aurais aimé que cela soit partagé dans la description.... Santé de a batterie à 98%, ce qui est plutôt très bien pour un reconditionné.

Rimpiango il vecchio 6 plus, che ho cambiato dopo sei anni, causa  vetro rotto e batteria esaurita, mai cambiata. Il 12 pro, anche se ricondizionato con batteria al 90%, ha una ridotta durata della batteria, di gran lunga inferiore alle prestazioni dichiarate e attese. L'unico aspetto apprezzato è il grandangolo e l'uso con poca luce della fotocamera.

 Come descritto nella presentazione del prodotto, l’iPhone arriva in una confezione anonima e non presenta evidenti segni di usura. purtroppo le videocamere nella parte posteriore sembrano essere particolarmente state soggette a graffi all’interno delle tasche o come stato maneggiato.Mi riservo di fornire un ulteriore aggiornamento della mia recensione dopo averlo provato per almeno due o tre settimane

No viene en su caja original ni con cargador-cable original. Pero está completamente NUEVO, ni un solo rasguño, ni al sol. La batería está al 86% lo cual está bien ya que prometen un mínimo de 80%. El terminal va super bien para lo que un iPhone se le espera.En mi caso estoy contento con este producto reacondicionado. El tiempo dirá si ha sido una buena inversión.

Mi sono rivolto ad Amazon per l’acquisto del cellulare rigenerato sicuro che non sarei rimasto deluso. Le aspettative sono state ampiamente confermate. Il cellulare è assolutamente pari al nuovo, con una capacità residua del 96% della batteria e l’assoluta assenza di imperfezioni. Ottimo acquisto come sempre Amazon è una garanzia in più.

 Prima e sicuramente ultima esperienza con un telefono ricondizionato. La confezione poteva essere curata meglio mettendo una pellicola protettiva adesiva sullo schermo,Il telefono era stato ripulito sommariamente aveva polvere e sporcizia sia nell attacco di ricarica della batteria che bello sportellino sim che intorno alle fotocamere inoltre non ho potuto valutare niente altro in quanto. On sono riuscito neanche a configurarlo perché dopo selezionata la lingua alla selezione del paese il telefono si bloccava e dopo venti secondi mi rimandava alla selezione della lingua.

Pagato rigenertao circa 850€. Esteticamente molto bene, ma batteria al 90% (ok che ancora buona ma x 850€ la potevano cambiare), problemi di connessione bluetooth (sia watch, sia airpods, sia altre marche….no), problemi di connessione con la macchina.Restituito subito
"
5617,B08PCDP3LM,3,"
The phone arrived in perfect conditions the only problem I’ve seen is with the battery it dies quite faster than expected but that also might be related to the usage I give to it but it doesn’t lasts all day long.

Acquistato dopo aver visto alcune recensioni, ma sono rimasto un po’ deluso. Batteria al 89% e con alcuni graffi sul lo schermo e al entrata del carica batteria. Il se ascolti una canzone il telefono si scarica in maniera folle. Pensavo davvero che avessi più qualità.

Absoluter Fehlkauf! Habe das iPhone mit ausgezeichnetem Zustand bestellt. Das Gerät kam absolut verschmutzt an. Die Lautsprecher sind völlig verdreckt und dicht. Die Akkuleistung betrug gerade mal noch 85%. Also definitiv nicht generalüberholt! Noch dazu war eine fremde Simkarte im Telefon und es kamen ausländische Nachrichten an. Die Verpackung wurde mit Aufklebern komplett zugeklebt, dass eine schadensfreie Entfernung nicht möglich war.Suchen sie sich einen anderen Verkäufer für ihr Gerät. Katastrophe. Nie wieder!
"
5626,B08PCDP3LM,5,"
Also ich bin echt begeistert. Die Lieferung erfolgte wirklich sehr schnell und der Zustand ist wirklich 1a. 100% Batterie, kaum äußerliche Gebrauchsspuren. Echt Top!

Absolut zu empfehlen. Ist mein erstes iPhone, ich wollte zusätzlich zum Preis auch die Umwelt schonen und daher ein refurbished kaufen. Allerdings war ich etwas unsicher was mich wohl erwarten würde… alles super! Der Akku liegt bei 98% Kapa, und der Zustand ist echt der Hammer. Bis auf ein paar Mikrokratzer am seitlichen Rahmen alles top. Kann’s nur jedem empfehlen!

L’iPhone 12 pro che ho acquistato ricondizionato come condizioni “eccellenti” presenta delle imperfezioni estetiche ed inoltre una vite in prossimità del connettore lightnin è leggermente svitata.Durante le prime prove di funzionamento ho subito notato una bassa potenza e qualità dell’audio sonoro dell’altoparlante. Successivamente mi sono accorto che la cuffia per le chiamate audio non funziona. Provvederò al rimborso

Das Display ist super und die Akkulaufzeit ist wie bei einem Neugerät.Der Versand ging sehr flott und sicher verpackt.

Me ha gustado la rapidez. No me ha gustado que no tenga caja, ni cargador y cable original ni la aguja para sacar la sim. Tiene un precio elevado para ser reacondicionado con esas faltas.

Das gebrauchte IPhone12 pro kam wie angekündigt in einer neutralen Verpackung mit Ladekabel und Zubehöradapter. Die Lieferung war schneller als angekündigt. Der Akku bei 93%, also alles super…?Leider konnte ich nur über den Lautsprecher telefonieren, die Hörmuschel funktioniert nicht.Apple hat hierzu auch schon mitgeteilt:„Apple hat festgestellt, dass es bei einem sehr kleinen Prozentsatz von iPhone 12- und iPhone 12 Pro-Geräten aufgrund einer eventuell fehlerhaften Komponente des Hörermoduls in manchen Fällen zu Tonproblemen kommen kann. Betroffene Geräte wurden zwischen Oktober 2020 und April 2021 hergestellt.Wenn dein iPhone 12 oder iPhone 12 Pro beim Tätigen oder Empfangen von Anrufen keinen Ton aus dem Hörer abgibt, ist es möglicherweise für Service qualifiziert.Qualifizierte Geräte werden von Apple oder einem autorisierten Apple Service Provider kostenlos repariert“Nur war dies bei dem gelieferten nicht mehr möglich, da die Garantiezeit abgelaufen war - das Telefon also nicht mehr „qualifiziert“ war.Das hätte eigentlich bei einem Test auffallen müssen. Werde das Telefon daher zurück schicken.

Offensichtlich ist das Handy mehrfach auf einen harten Untergrund gefallen.Ebenfalls wird keine Original Verpackung geliefert, das wird in der Artikelbeschreibung nicht erwähnt.Rückabwicklung schwierig, Händler reagiert nicht.Einzig positiv ist die schnelle Lieferung per DHL Express, wofür der Händler nichts kann.

Ich habe ein kaputtes Gerät zugeschickt bekommen. Das Beste an der ganzen Bestellung war das kaputte Ladekabel mit Adapter. LeuteFür 800€ Ist das eine echt große Fehlinvestition.Wenn das Handy schon kaputt ist schickt doch wenigstens ein funktionstüchtiges Ladegerät.Amazon enttäuscht mich zum 3 mal!Am Besten ist es man geht persönlich in einen Laden und kauft es direkt beim Händler.

Leider kam bei mir ein defektes Gerät an - meine Kopfhörer vom Vorgängermodell funktionieren nicht. Nach mehreren Versuchen mit verschiedenen Original Apple Kopfhörern (die alle auf einem anderen Gerät einwandfrei funktionieren!!), kann ich nur sagen - Finger weg von Refurbed. Es ist immer noch zu viel Geld für ein nicht intaktes Smartphone! Dann lieber gleich bei Apple ein neues kaufen.
"

Handy war optimistisch entsprechend der Vorstellung (kleiner optisch gut sichtbarer Kratzer entsprach nicht der Vorstellungwar aber akzeptabel für den Preis). Nach wenigen Minuten des Aufladens war klar, dass das Handy zurück zum Verkäufer geht, denn der Ladevorgang wurde immer wieder unterbrochen und dann wieder verbunden. Enttäuschend da dieses Problem doch im Vorfeld hätte erkannt werden müssen!

I wanted to buy the iPhone 14 pro max but it was out of stock at the time, this phone was my second choice and I’m honestly glad I bought it. Despite lacking a few of the flagship features found in the 14 pro,(such as a 120 hertz display, a few camera upgrades and the dynamic island) it still punches above its weight it terms of quality. After looking at the specifications of this phone and comparing it to the pro model, there are far more similarities than differences. The camera is still spectacular and apart from the macro lens, you would struggle to see the differences in pictures taken with both phones. To summarise, it’s a great phone that’s worth the money
"
5731,B0BDJY2DFH,5,"
Apple return to making a large version of their normal handset for the first time since the 8 plus and what a brilliant bit of kit it is.I find the cameras on a standard iPhone superb and more than good enough for my needs. For the iPhone 12 & 13 I’ve had to get the Pro Max to get the larger screen.Don’t get me wrong, the pro max is a great phone but unless you’re a serious photographer it’s likely the camera’s never going to reach its potential with the average user.Being able to buy the 256GB version of the standard iPhone for more or less the price of the 128GB pro Max is a real yes please moment.As an avid product red buyer I’m also delighted to be able to go back to red. The Pro Max has never been available in any of the colours I like so I’ve always hidden it in a case.The iPhone 14 Plus is fast, the battery life a massive improvement, the cameras are excellent and the price point, whilst expensive, offers the average user more for their money.
"
5732,B0BDJY2DFH,5,"
Purchased the new iPhone 14 after getting fed up with my old iPhone 6s for a year or so?This is great technology and although it was expensive, Amazon at least gave me 5% off. Could not get anything as trade-in from Apple, so this was a bonus. Changing over to the new iPhone is now very easy.
"
5733,B0BDJY2DFH,5,"
I never had a plus iPhone and I didn't want to spend that much money to get the Pro Max, so this iPhone 14 plus was perfect, the size of the phone and the battery are great.

I love this phone. I've never had an iPhone so from my perspective this item is insanely good.The screen is large, battery lasts long and the camera is extremely good (it supersedes what I had on my previous phones). It's expensive but worth the money.However, from what I understood, the refresh frame on the screen on the Plus version is a bit lower than the Pro. So perhaps if you are picky when it comes to iphones, look into that because it might bother you. It doesnt bother me at all (due to my previous phone being total garbo).5/5 stars! Love it :)

Not much change from the 13 series but I come from series 11. It’s a huge leap. Amazing camera. Very fast. Clear screen. Amazing camera. Brilliant operating system. Crash detection on this model. Get at least 256gb one as you’ll need it. You will need to pay iCloud storage too as 5gb free isn’t enough.

The iPhone 14 Plus is extremely bad value. Apart from a slightly larger screen, there are no standout features that make this superior than last years iPhone 13. Even worse, if you pay a little bit more, you can get the flagship iPhone 14 Pro! My biggest question is who did Apple make this for?!

J’ai mis 2 mois à me décider, entre choisir un iPhone 14 , 14 plus ou 13 pro max … désirant un écran assez grand le choix c’est donc fait entre la qualité photo du 13 pro max et la légèreté et l’autonomie du 14 plus . Perso mon utilité personnelle se contente de l’objectif du 14 plus ( et il est déjà pas mal !) question autonomie croyez le ou non le 14 plus me fait 48 h voir plus ! ( jeux , réseaux , Visio …) le 13 pro max pour la même utilité fait un peu moins de 48h (testé) . J’ai donc opté pour le 14 plus et j’en suis ravi, le prix reste élevé mais justifié pour un iPhone de ce genre

Migrating from a iPhone 7 plus after long five years, where the single complaint was battery life, I decided for an upgrade. No charger was provided, but at the end, I've accumulated so many, that this was really not an issue. But a USB-C cable was provided, which is a good help for faster charging. Migrating Apps and settings was really the best experience I had: By starting the new Phone I've had the option for migration, which required just a confirmation on my old device. Passwords were ""automagically"" transferred and in less than one hour everything landed on the new device. Everything was working, including Apple CarPlay and other Apple stuff. Third party Apps were almost Ok, except for very special cases like Bank Account Apps and Authenticators.Other concern was FaceID, since the previous used the fingerprint sensor, but this also worked like a charm, after following the configuration wizard.

5756,B0BDJY2DFH,5,"
Certes l’iPhone et iOS sont une combinaison parfaite. L’écran est très agréable pour naviguer, visionner des vidéos, jouer. Une finition et des matériaux de bonnes factures. Un poids contenu malgré sa taille. Mais le prix, le prix… cher pour une appareil qui ne profite que d’un écran plus grand et recycle le processeur de la génération précédente. Rien de nouveau pour le reste, si vous désirez rester au format plus compact, alors prenez un iPhone 13, le 14 ne vous apportera rien de plus, enfin si, une facture plus salée.
"
5757,B0BDJY2DFH,5,"
Super schnelle Lieferung und Abwicklung. Beim starten hat er zwar ein Update verlangt, aber war nicht schlimm. Ich kann im allgemeinen noch nicht viel darüber sagen, da ich es noch komplett einrichten muss und mir ein Panzerglas drauf machen lassen möchte. Es ist schon recht groß im Gegensatz zum alten und schwerer. Aber man wusste ja die Größe des Handys laut Hersteller. Wie es sich im Alltag bewährt, wird sich raus stellen. Ich muss es jetzt in Ruhe einrichten. Farbe finde ich okay. Vielleicht in ein paar Monaten mehr.

Bin vom Iphone 12 umgestiegen da ich, ende fünfzig, einfach ein wenig größere Buchstaben brauche (scheiß Altersweitsichtigkeit). Ich bin äußerst zufrieden mit dem Wechsel, whatsapp, Zeitung, Email  etc. sind jetzt (zur Not) auch ohne Lesebrille lesbar. Das Pro max war mir schlicht zu teuer, dessen sicher super Kamera wäre für meine Bedürfnisse überzogen, die Kamera des ""normalen"" 14/14 plus ist schon super für mich. Ob 60 hz oder 120 hz Anzeige ist mir egal, ich bin kein Gamer. Alles in Allem ein tolles, großes Telefon mit dem man für die nächsten Jahre bedient sein wird.  Ansonsten ist es natürlich unübertroffen wie Apple alles zu einen Ökosystem zusammengeführt hat, Iphone, Ipad, Iwatch und Apple TV harmonieren perfekt zusammen, ohne das übliche Geärgere wie bei Android üblich sobald es um mehr als ein Gerät geht.Update nach ein paar Tagen Nutzung im Vergleich zum iPhone pro max meiner Freundin: was sofort auffällt ist dass das Pro deutlich schwerer ist, meiner Freundin ist es egal, deren Handy ist in der Handtasche die eh ungefähr 2 kg Kram enthält, ich habe das Handy in der Jacke, da ist mir das leichte Plus deutlich lieber. Der zweite große Unterschied ist der Akku, das Plus schafft bei mir fast zwei Tage, das Pro nur gut einen.Ich bin auch nach dem Vergleich sehr zufrieden mit der Entscheidung für das Plus und gegen das Pro

Ich bin sehr zufrieden mit dem Smartphone. Dass es sich hierbei nicht um das 120 Hz Display handelt, fällt eigentlich nicht auf. Nur wenn man es mit diesem vergleicht, im normalen Gebrauch merkt man es nicht außer vielleicht beim Spielen eines Spiels. Ansonsten ist es wirklich sehr gut in der Verwendung, der Akku hält wirklich lange und auch die Kamera macht gute Fotos.Insgesamt finde ich das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis deutlich besser gegenüber den pro Varianten.
"
5761,B0BDJY2DFH,4,"
Le téléphone est arrivé sans problème via le transporteur, un code est demandé pour garantir la livraison et la boîte est scellée.Je dirai juste que j'ai été surpris de ne pas trouver d'écouteur filaires, pour un tel prix ce serait le minimum sachant qu'Apple fait déjà pas mal d'économie sur le chargeur qui n'est pas fourni non plus.Il n'y a pas non plus de coque ni de protège écran...Le contenu de la boîte se résume au téléphone et au câble usb-c vers lightning. Pour un tel prix on pourrait s'attendre au minimum à avoir un protège écran basique et une coque, le temps d'acheter le nécessaire pour faire mieux.

5762,B0BDJY2DFH,5,"
Wie immer bei Apple, ein top gerät. Die preispolitik bezüglich des speichers ist zwar fragwürdig mit ca 400€ differenz zwischen 128GB und 1TB. Aber mir persönlich reichen 128GB in dem fall. Es ist kein schnäpchen und die arbeitsumstände sollen ja auch nicht die besten sein, doch das müssen die verantwortlichen in den griff bekommen.Im vergleich zu android läuft beim iphone alles flüssig und das gefällt mir.Wer auf ein paar spielereien wie die kameranotch und die kamera pro funktionen verzichten kann aber trotzdem die größe des pro max möchte macht hier nichts falsch. Wenns vom geld her geht. In schulden sollte sich keiner wegen einem smartphone stürzen nur um mithalten zu können. Auch sollte man vielleicht vorher das smartphone mal in der hand haben und das normale mit dem plus vergleichen. Das normale liegt top in der hand, das plus erfordert schon öfters mal beide hände. Somit könnte man sich eventuell paar hundert euro sparen und das normale mit 6,1 zoll nehmen. Es ist auf jedenfall ein unterschied der sich auch in der hosentasche bemerkbar macht.

I've been a long-time user of Android and I'm also a tech enthusiast. I've been using a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2 since it was released. At the time, that seemed like a cool purchase but as time went on, I found myself having very little use for the fold functionality and so I'd often just use the smaller front screen - not ideal for typing but in those situations, I still rarely wanted to open up to the larger screen. The cameras were decent, but at the same time I always preferred the photos from the Huawei P30 Pro I'd had before it. Android has long suffered with becoming bloated and slow over time.I also found that the battery life was becoming less than ideal. For context - many days I don't use my phone much. Some days I don't use it at all. To be finding my battery draining 15-20% in 10 hours overnight when I'm not using it felt like too much. I like to keep my phone battery charged above 50%, so if I ever needed to take it anywhere where I would be using it at least some of the time, I'd have to ensure I'd got a battery pack with me too.When considering a new phone, I wanted something that wouldn't drain battery significantly while not being used, a larger single screen, and great cameras. I wasn't entirely sold on moving over to Apple, but having recently switched to using a Macbook and having gotten an iPad earlier in the year, I was still open to the idea.All reviews came down to 2 options - the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra or the iPhone 13 Pro Max. Since I didn't want to find myself with a device that was becoming slow and bloated or randomly losing huge amounts of battery when not being used for hours, I settled on the iPhone 13 Pro Max.It is by far the fastest phone I've ever bought. It starts up from cold boot in around 15-20 seconds (by comparison, the Z Fold 2 and every other Android I've ever owned would often take over a minute to reach the home screen, and another few minutes to be usable).The battery life is exceptional. In the usual 10-hour overnight downtime, the battery often only drains 4-5%. I've actually managed 2 days of moderate usage (including camera, social media, and some light gaming) and STILL had 55% battery remaining. All this usage was while at home connected to wifi. This is head and shoulders above any other phone I've ever used. Most Android devices I've used would be at around 20% battery remaining with similar usage patterns. I feel confident that I could manage 4 or maybe even 5 days of non-usage before the device needed charging if I really needed to. I also feel confident that I don't need to keep the phone charged above 50% because that still gives me over a day of moderate usage. My long-term battery anxiety has vanished since getting this phone.The cameras and photos they produce are great. The long-exposure photos (up to 30 seconds) of the night sky turn out fantastic. They don't look as great as what you'd get from a decent full frame DSLR and good quality lenses, but this is a phone that weighs around 15% of what a typical camera setup weighs with a much smaller imaging sensor. The macro mode quality is OK, but to get better quality, it's sometimes more feasible to use the 3x lens - this gets you sharp focus on the subject with great detail, and a nice background blur.The speaker quality is great for music. Admittedly I don't listen to music or movie audio through phone speakers often, but the times I do, it's very nice to have great stereo and bass response. It's not going to compete with larger speakers or devices but for its size, it does an admirable job.The screen is very bright and can be seen even in direct sunlight, but you can also set the brightness to very low if you're using it in low-light environments such as a bedroom at night and it won't sear out your retinas like some other devices at their lowest settings. HDR content on it is almost too bright, but I'd expect nothing less from the technology.I did only give this device 4/5 for value for money primarily because even after all these years, I still think the price of top-end smartphones has reached excessive levels. However, comparing it with the rest of the current market, this is a great option and one I would highly recommend. Even as a long-term Android user, the benefits this brings to me far outweigh anything the competition can provide.

iPhone 13 Pro Max; 2nd one I've bought since Jan 2022 (my wife's got the 1st one; I treated myself to the 2nd one)...Unfortunately it had constant wifi & 5G connection issues (it'd connect and then drop, constantly, and had to soft reset, constantly); this is not good for a c£1200 phone!!!Other than that; it's a belting phone with superb cameras and battery life and if you want the best Apple can offer you this is it!The issues are sods law with this mobile; it won't happen to them all, so don't let this put you off. Just wanted to be honest about it!Having seen they've released the Green one I may buy that; when Apple get around to refunding this one (they're taking their time over it as well as terrible tracking via their UPS service)For now I've got the Poco F3 mobile and in all honesty; it's really surprised me at how good it is for £1k less! Ok; hasn't got the camera power; but it's a great screen with easy usability (I like Android and iOS so at home with either)However I'm lucky that I've still got an 'as new' Pixel 4XL 128GB and that phone and its camera, IMO, are still VERY hard to beat! It's still a superb phone, but I needed a separate phone for my personal use as well as business...I'll report back when I buy the Green iPhone 13 Pro Max 😉

Brilliant phone, after moving from a iPhone 11 Pro to a iPhone 13 pro max. Battery life is a game changer for me lasts me full day with heavy usage until night when I put it on charge and even then it’s on 20-30% I’m writing this review at 1:30am BTW.Camera is great especially the macro mode you can capture the close ups really well. Low light not a problem. The cinematic mode is a very nice feature and makes your videos feel like a movie.Refresh rate on these is beautiful and glides through.Charges up very quickly. Would advise anyone to use Apple approved charger and nothing else.I did not want to pay all upfront so I got the 5 month installateur plan with 0 interest which is great.Overall I would say this has been a great purchase for me and delivery was next day.Thank you Amazon

I previously had a I phone 8 plus. This had an excellent camera on it and it was because of the quality of the pictures that I sold my Fuji Mirrorless Camera. Reading the reviews on the 13 I decided to upgrade and although I have only had the 13 for a few weeks I am very impressed with it. It offers excellent pictures in all light situations and offers greater versatility compared to the 8, although the 8 is in my opinion an excellent camera phone. I am still learning many of the available functions. To date very pleased and yes is expensive but you only live once.

I have had every incarnation of the iPhone since 2007. Yes, I have had others in between (Android) but nothing comes close really. Obviously this is my opinion and people will disagree.The reason I say is at the top is that- the build quality is second to none- the screen is phenomenal- face unlock really is the best out there- battery life is amazing (heavy use on some days and I still have 30-40% remaining)- iOS is comprehensive and makes the whole package simplistic and feature rich- everything just works- accessories are plentifulThere are more things that knit together, such as my family all have iPhones so iMessage and FaceTime are great features if you are in the ecosystem of iOS.I am extremely pleased with my iPhone 13 Pro Max and will only change it when the new iPhone comes out.

I purchased this phone after a friend accident my broke my current. After it arrived, I immediately noticed a paint scratch on the phone and received no apology, just £40. £40 does not cover the cost to repair this.The battery life starts poorly, it was not close to 100% and as a refurbishment it should have a brand new battery.Overall I’m disappointed by the quality for the price paid, I was expecting almost perfect condition. I would not recommend buying a phone here.

I decided to finally upgrade from the iPhone X to the iPhone 13 Pro Max (like many users it seems!), and I'll say straight off the bat its worth it. I seriously can't remember in recent memory there being better advancements in 1 year, with the only thing I dislike being that the connector is still lightning and not USB C.My iPhone X was a pain this past 12 months, with the battery in particular a constant source of frustration. It was showing 82% battery health, but I would be lucky to get more than a few hours. The 13 Pro Max literally lasts a whole day of use, and I still don't need to charge it. It has 8 hours (over 30%!) more video playback than the 12 Pro Max and 15 hours more than my iPhone X, ideal for those of us who watch a lot of videos on our phones. Can't forget the 50% more audio playback too!The 120hz screen really is a game changer for iPhones, and makes swiping such a smoother and more enjoyable experience - something really underrated considering how often we'll swipe over the course of a day. The 1,000 nits (1,200 nits with HDR content) compared to my iPhone X's 625 nits makes a huge difference when viewing the phone in sunlight.The A15 processor compared to the iPhone X's A11 is just an annihilation. Geekbench has the 13 Pro Max at 85% better single core performance and 97% better multi-core, so if you use intensive apps or games this will be worth the upgrade alone.Finally with the camera, the specs may look similar on paper, but the photos are a night and day difference. I have always justified phone upgrades in the past due to not having a standalone camera, but this is the first time I can genuinely say I don't think I miss not having one.10/10

I get the new iPhone each year and as usual, this phone does not disappoint.Naturally each new phone should be better than the predecessor and this is no different however there are a number of areas there they have improved hugely.The battery life is incredible. I am coming from an iPhone 12 Pro which I wouldn’t call a phone with a bad battery anyway but with modern phones being power hungry, I would generally be out of battery and need a top up before the end of the day…. Not with this phone! I have been heavily using the phone and have been getting two days out the battery with the pro max.The camera is by far the best camera I’ve ever seen on a phone. Nothing else compares in relation to the clarity. There are other phones that have a better optical zoom which this phone tops out at 3x, but for me it’s enough.I could go on about other things such as the ProMotion screen and the premium feel and the striking new colours (I got the Sierra Blue), but I’m sure you already get the idea.This is the best phone available at the moment on the market.
"
5834,B09G91CF3D,5,"
I’ve owned a good majority of iPhones starting with the original! For me this is definitely the best having not upgraded since the 7plus and only sticking to sim only contacts! I have fairly big hands/long fingers so am able to reach the whole screen with one hand! Anyone changing from Touch ID to Face ID may have an issue at 1st but you soon forget the home button. The cameras are excellent I’ve not fully tested to the maximum abilities but is more than enough for the average photographer! Battery wise I charge my phone every other day compared to everyday with old iPhones (average usage 5h30m according to screen time) this includes listening to music and using tv streaming mainly football) all in all couldn’t ask for a better a phone highly recommend at least 512gb for those who take a lot of pics/vids plus downloads

Great piece of kit, just like every other iteration before it.Love the screen size (pro-max) and even though I have the phone in a cover, the blue colour is good too!As for price, we all know these things are stupidly over priced, but we want them so we buy them!Cheers

Love my new iphone. Decided to get top of the range after my old iPhone 8 Plus ceased to work so effectively.Better lasts for ages. Love the gold colour. Arrived on time the next day, so don’t know why people had trouble getting theirs. Amazon is alway clear about how long a delivery will take.Anyway I fully recommend and also recommend the added bonus of paying interest free for 24 months.I love Amazon!!

5838,B09G91CF3D,5,"
Amazing phone in every aspect, which is hard for me to say having previously been a devoted Sony user. Battery life great, weight and size good. Camera is amazing! All with the added knowledge of knowing you have a secure and reliable phone. Yes they’re bloody expensive but you get what you pay for, and they do hold their money well. I am converted!

Mixed review.Apart from being an oversize behemoth with unexpected advantage of exercising my lumbricals, it does its job. What it loses in sleekness it gains in clarity of pictures and speed. Was meant to be a pivot to switch to apple products but not impressed enough to make the switch, so staying with only this Apple product until the euphoria of having a new high end phone dies down

I decided to treat myself to a new phone after having my iPhone X from new for nearly 4 years. The camera is excellent on the 13 Pro Max, I can capture photos of star in the evenings (albeit in the Welsh countryside), the screen is crystal clear and considerably bigger than my iPhone X. It is an awful lot faster with the A15 chip as opposed to the A11 chip, I can achieve a lot more in a short space of time which is always a winner.Physically the size is a considerable difference, which is what I wanted. I wanted to feel like I'd upgraded and had a new/different phone. I am petite and the 13 Pro Max surprisingly fits quite comfortably in my hands, which was a worry of mine. I went from the 64GB iPhone X in black to the 256GB iPhone 13 Pro Max in Sierra Blue and have 0 regrets.I would highly recommend.
"
5849,B09G91CF3D,5,"
The phone is amazing as usual and the battery is good too!! I feel like it could be better because mine heats up during charging however there’s no issues with the phone.

I love Apple products but they have disappointed recently with their service however Amazon never fails so thank you!

The best yet. Everything is amazing. The processing power means I can use it for business related dictation whilst walking the dog using Siri and the voice to text accuracy is phenomenal. That’s just one app example. For me - my best investment of 2021. And the battery power is on another level. Basically a full charge is giving me a full 2 days based on heavy intermittent use. And the ability to stream high Rez 24 bit music tracks on 5g Networks…..don’t get me started. It beats my home broadband connection by a wide margin - that yellow buffering  line on Qobuz fills the screen immediately and the listening experience is sublime.

Going from a 7 Plus to this was a bit mind boggling. Being a hobbyist photographer I'm surprised how much the camera system has improved, showing there's merit to Apple's marketing campaign for this generation phone.The quality of the still and video is amazing, coupled with a superb battery life and 'promotion' interface making this a dream upgrade! If you have skipped two or more generations of iPhone and you're considering an upgrade, now would definitely be a good time (providing you're willing to wait longer for the shipping).

Brilliant all rounder. Excellent sharp big screen, fantastic speakers- great for netflx on the go. Photo and video experience is brilliant- probably the best on the market. Battery life very good. Generally very good OS. Only minor gripe is the predictive text/spelling still lags behind google/android. But that’s splitting hairs really. Highly recommended

5859,B09G91CF3D,5,"
Outstanding Phone! The battery life in unreal.  I never charge my phone above 85% to preserve the battery integrity (makes for better resale values) I have yet to finish the day with less than 50% charge (I don't play games on it) The Camera is amazing, although the movie focus thingy is a bit gimmicky IMO. Although I am sure some would find it useful.  The screen is gorgeous and Pro Motion makes the world of difference.  You will never go back to a 60Hz screen after using it for a while.

My 12 pro max had connectivity issues with wifi and bluetooth so I am not sure how much different this should be compared to the 12 but the speed difference between this and the 12 is amazing. Of course, there isn't that much of a difference between the two spec wise so I am amazed to see how much better this is than the 12 I had. Some of that may be that the phone was more faulty than I realised but for me, it is so much faster and much more vibrant than the Iphone 12 pro max

5861,B09G91CF3D,5,"
This phone is fantastic what can I say apple never fails to impress. If you’re looking for an iPhone upgrade and want a bigger version this is the one. The sierra blue is absolutely gorgeous the flat edges feel so good in your hand battery life is the best compared to any iPhone I’ve ever had totally impressed with this yes it has a hefty price tag but with apple you know you can’t go wrong and the quality and premium feeling is second to none.

It’s a pretty amazing device,13 pro max is massive,so you need both hands to use it.I love it,it takes amazing photos,internet is also faster and the screen is stunning.I had been let down in the past with battery life but this device can easily survive almost 2 days without charging and also charging became really fast.It’s a great device with high price tag but if you consider using it for couple of years then end of the day I think it’s worth it.

It’s the same phone as Iphone 12 pro max apart from Battery. It has made a significant difference in how long the phone lasts however It is not an upgrade justified by it’s price tag. Apple have mastered the skill of conspicuous consumership with drug dealer style addiction in getting consumers accepting drip feed style changes to flagship model.In summary It’s an improved battery and no other significant change that majority of users would spot a difference between 12&13.

This thing looks a beauty, runs silky smooth, super responsive and the battery and camera are brilliant so far.  All things the old phone were no longer and hadn't been for about 5 years.  Reasons for taking this long to upgrade?  I was coping ok-ish but this year I pulled the trigger as the upgrade seemed significant with the 120hz, camera and battery combo.  Of course coming from an iPhone 6 Plus even an iPhone 11 Pro or older would have probably done alright, but this is the phone, this blue colour, the best iPhone ever as of now until the next one.  The phone looks absolute class and even nicer in person than in pictures.

Replacing my iPhone 8 Plus, so huge difference in terms of speed, battery life and camera quality......battery is very good for the first time. The sound is one of the thing that also impressed me a lot, really good sound again compared to 8 Plus. Also the screen is very bright even in a sunny day, very good when using sat nav, finally I can see it without having to make shadow. I miss my finger scanner though.... also don't like that the lenses are sticking out but that is not so bad overall, I can live with that.I do recommend the phone especially if u have an old phone as I had.

Things I don’t like:-Apple locked in ecosystem and their greedy behaviour to force developers to use subscriptions to increase Apple 30% commission means the customer is losing as developers aren’t incentivised to develop open source and free apps.-face recognition is a hit and miss, much prefer fingerprint recognition.-it’s quite a heavy phone, can be uncomfortable at times, especially once you’ve added a case.

Must say I didn’t think that the 13 Pro would be any different from my 12 Pro but there is definitely a lot more features. Really great device especially when you pair it with your watch.

Disappointed to find USB Cable does not fit UK sockets.  You need to buy an Adaptor separately.

Never thought apple products would be this bad. Have been using Iphone for the past 10 years, and this is the worst iphone I have used so far. Terrible touch, doesn't recognise face. I felt cheated and I was not sure if I was sent an original Iphone. I had to return it as it was not worth a penny.
"
5943,B09G91CF3D,3,"
Firstly when you use you don’t need lots of storage so 256 is max why cloud and or home server synology etc but cost of unit should have stayed under £1k replace every 2yrs but Apple has got greedy! So wait till phone is 500£ and buy your self a decent camera! Don’t b fooled!

 1. Keyboard is flashing and this cause a lot of mistakes.2. When it do pictures it can show half from one camera and half from another camera(( like 2 different views with a line between.Can’t understand it is problem of the phone or OP.
"
5945,B09G91CF3D,1,"
The camera is the worst I’ve ever had on a phone, every image is dark and grainy thanks to the ‘digital zoom’.Downloading a 3rd party app then makes the camera as it should be, but 4 months in and I’ve had enough. Thank you to Amazon for replacing it.

pretty good
"
5950,B09G91CF3D,5,"
even though this was bought as a gift for my partner, the quality shows and from what I hear, the battery life lasts for quite a while. not used the face recognition so couldn't review this feature.
"
5951,B09G91CF3D,4,"
Everything on the phone is great... except for not having the fingerprint reader, coming from a phone with a fingerprint reader it feels awful to have to input the code all the time because either I have my mask on, or I'm in my bed with half my face in the pillow. It really makes the difference in terms of usability and would should seriously consider that.
"

Honestly the best phone I’ve ever used , amazing camera , I stopped using my DSLR because of it. No regrets at all

I've leapt several generations and gone from a stone-age iPhone 6S Plus to this, the iPhone 13 Pro Max 256gb in Sierra Blue. My old phone, which I still use, was causing me grief because its battery wouldn't last half a day and the camera was pretty ordinary.I've had the 13 Pro Max for about a month now, and I'm still >mind: blown< by its battery. Talk about night & day improvement! It's incredible. 48 hours is normal, no problems, and on a couple of occasions it's stretched to 3 days. I know this dreamland scenario won't last forever, but at the moment this new phone has transformed my usage and ability to plan ahead. It seems an extraordinary achievement. It charges fast, too - I think I can get from near-zero to 100% in about 2.5 hours, maybe 3.Then there's the camera. This, too, makes for a quantum leap forwards compared to my iPhone 6S Plus and it's possibly the No.1 reason I wanted to upgrade at all. I need to learn a lot about the phone-camera's abilities as far as creativity is concerned, but even for a simple point-and-shoot thicko like me, I can see huge advances in picture quality. Especially in low light. I was expecting great things, and I have not been disappointed.My one gripe that (so far) won't go away is the facial recognition system - especially when wearing a COVID face-mask. I have to say that I prefer the old thumb fingerprint technology, for what I feel is a good reason - with my iPhone 6S Plus I can open up the phone from pretty much any angle, and I'm talking mainly about when it's flat on my desk at about 45 degrees to my face. It doesn't really matter what angle it's at, I can open the phone up without needing to  pick it up. This is not the case with the 13 Pro Max - and it's getting a bit annoying. If the phone is not pointing at my face, I have to pick it up - and pretty fast too, otherwise the face recog disappears and security reverts to the PIN. I've lost count of the number of times I've had to use the PIN to operate my phone, and I'm talking 10-20 times a day at least, whereas with my old phone it would be once or twice, if that. With the 13 Pro Max there is no fingerprint ID as far as I know (humble apologies if I'm wrong) and I wish there was, because I definitely prefer the old to the new. I suppose the level of security has been enhanced (with facial recog) which has to be an important benefit, but I don't really like it.It's been slightly underwhelming in the sense that so many things I used to do on my old phone - by which I mainly mean use of apps - is hardly any different on the new one. Yes, the visible screen is much bigger despite the unchanged 6.7-inch phone body length, but in many respects the use of ubiquitous apps such as Facebook, Messenger, Whatsapp and text messages is very little different from before. I guess these apps have little or nothing to do with Apple, so it's hardly surprising.When I think of the cost of this new 13 Pro Max, and the resale value of my iPhone 6S Plus (in near perfect condition but worth maybe 50 quid), the law of diminishing returns kicks in and in some ways I regard the new phone as incredibly expensive and poor value. But the cost has to be put to one side, and you have to admire the technological advances made and quite simply wonder at the extraordinary abilities of such a small device. It's obviously right up there with the best phones of 2021, and while the cost has made my toes curl, I'm pleased with my purchase (which was made directly from Apple).

For the price I was expecting the GPS to be top notch, unless under direct sky the GPS takes 5-10 minutes to find me, I have a POCO F3 that finds me instantly even in buildings and whatnot, embarrassing….

 the gold is incredible. It looks like you got it straight from the jewellersThe main difference i would say is the screen seems more responsive and reactive.I think thats to do with increased touch and screen reaction time.Your iphone 12 pro max case wont fit. Because the buttons on the side are a touch higher.My hands on review for looks is, it looks really similar to my previous iphone.Usually every year they make it look different.But this time it looks similar
"
5960,B09G91CF3D,5,"
The first touch of this iPhone is great - firm, durable, not heavier than my older iPhone 7 Pro (I was worried it would be), well- made as you expect from Apple. My biggest delight was to set it up. You know, I have lots of apps in my older iPhone, lots of data, and I was wondering how I would transfer all to my new iPhone. Having the experience from switching from iPhone 3 to iPhone 7 after 10 years, painful and difficult as the phones did not communicate, nor my old MacBook communicated with the 7th generation of the iPhone, I was a bit worried. iPhone 3 to iPhone 7 means 4 generations, iPhone 7 to iPhone 13 means 6 generations. Apple thought this through for me. The phones do communicate and I saw the easy option to make the initial setup letting the phones do all the job by themselves. So, I followed the instructions, let the phones do their job, and followed my own business while the phones followed theirs. Yes, there is some fine-tuning and likely watching some tutorials as the iPhone 13 is different, however, the initial worries did not materialise. This is exciting.

I started off with the iPhone 3G years ago but went on to Samsung when the S5 came out and have had every Samsung S range up until last year. But after playing with my wife’s 13 pro I thought wow they’ve come along way since I changed over and decided to take the plunge. Bit expensive going on to the Apple eco system!  But worth it.
"
5962,B09G91CF3D,5,"
First iPhone brought, the speed of this phone is way over my expectations, it is so fast smooth and jumps through any task with so much ease, the best phone you will ever need if your looking for a decent phone for the power of a pc but in small form factor, then I would recommend this phone. This phone is worth every penny.
"
5963,B09G91CF3D,5,"
This device is absolutely stunning! It is perfect for people who love Apple Devices. Its sound quality, facial recognition and super smooth touch are all perfect! 100% better battery life. The battery doesn’t go down for upto a day and half. Its such powerful battery. Love it

the new iphone 13 pro max takes stunning photos, if you're into photography then you will love this. With the new IOS 15 the whole phone just feels and runs amazing, despite it looking pretty much like the 12, you'll know everything from the insides to the outsides are better.I video call daily so it's great having a 4k selfie cam, can use facebook messenger and facetime in the best selfie quality you can get on a phone.The phone feels extremely smooth with the 120Hz display, swiping all around doesn't make me feel sick due to how smooth it is now, this has been a long wanted feature of the iphone and I am glad they finally added it.The phone has lasted me OVER a day with a whole charge, amazing, i love it so much.No charger again, sadly, but I got my old ones.Also get a good case, this phone needs it im sure especially a this price.
"
5971,B09G91CF3D,5,"
The photo & videos are the best I’ve seen on any phone differently any iPhone. Well worth the upgrade.

The camera is fantastic and the amount you can do with it is amazing, the quality of the pictures are the best I have ever seen

5973,B09G91CF3D,5,"
I was waiting for an Iphone with 120hz and finally here we have it, the camera continues to impress and improve, much prefer the aesthetic of the 13 compared to the 12 with the bigger lenses that mean business, having gone from iphone to try the samsung s21 ultra I'm over the moon to be back on an iphone, apple have just nailed a beautifully smooth user experience, it's refreshing and easy to run/setup.The new sierra blue colorway looks better to the eye than in photos (in my opinion)- Battery life has blown my mind, battery percentage goes down so slowly and charges up extremely fast. what more could you want.The one area of concern for me with the pro max is the weight and size, I sometimes wish I had gotten the pro as the size of this phone often feels like a burden more than a joy, I've seen people refer to the pro max feeling like a paving slab! but after a lot of use I am getting used to it and doesn't take anyway from the impressive performance of the phone.

I purchased the iPhone 13 Pro Max from my mobile service provider and it arrived a day after release day.I was initially torn between getting the normal size iPhone 13 Pro, or going the whole way and getting the Max; my concern, like many, was will it fit comfortably into my pocket. Long story short, I went for it, and I’m so glad I did.I’ve upgraded from the iPhone X so my observations are influenced by this:Camera: The camera is amazing, it actually does take photos at night and makes them clear (due to the extended exposure and LiDAR Scanner I assume).Battery: The battery life… it charges quick and holds its charge for so long, my iPhone X needed charging twice a day, I could get 2 days out of this with general usage.Size: The size - I thought if I wasn’t going to go big, I might as well stay with my old phone, and as I said above, it’s great, typing is easier, watching stuff is better, even reading on the go (turned landscape) is great and it fits comfortably into my front trouser pocket.Sound: The sound… I compared a track on my iPhone X to this phone and this phone (13 Pro Max) is much louder and clearer - I don’t need to default to my UE Boom when listening to audio books anymore.Overall, yes it’s expensive, but if you use the camera, listen to music or audio books, read, game, and watch series in your phone, the iPhone 13 Pro Max may well be the ideal phone for you.NOTE: The 4K recording that will come out this autumn/fall is only available on 256GB storage and above, the 128GB will only allow you to record at 1080p due to the size of the recording - still good, but go into the purchase knowing the full facts.NOTE: it only comes with the cable, not a plug. If you own an iPad Pro or newer MacBook you’ll have a USB-C plug already, if not, you can use an old charger as the connection to the phone is the same as previous models.If you found this review helpful, I’d really appreciate it if you could give it a thumbs up / click helpful. It lets me know my reviews are helpful, and is a good incentive to keep reviewing. Thank you.

Thanks to it's A15 bionic chip, with a 6-core CPU and 5-core GPU (for gaming and graphical work/apps) the The iPhone 13 Pro Max is THE MOST powerful smartphone in the world.  There is nothing this phone cannot handle and it means Apple will continue to support the phone with iOS updates (i.e. security/software updates) for the next 5 to 6 years - longer than any other phone manufacturer!The battery comfortably lasts 2 days - and sometimes longer with light use, which is particularly useful if you travel regularly.The screen is also very good and if you're someone who needs a powerful smartphone for work, then it stands to reason you use a phone a lot... and therefore the larger screen of the Pro Max will pay off.The camera on the Pro and Pro Max is outstanding and the new 'Macro Mode', found on both the Pro and Pro Max, is a lot of fun to use where I have been taking photos of objects just 2cm away!  In fact it's the first time I have felt a smartphone camera can compete with a more professional camera.If you want or need the most powerful smartphone in the world then get the Pro or Pro Max.  The main difference between them is the screen size, weight, battery life and price.  Aside from that they have exactly the same features.

Although I’m not the biggest fan of Apple I’ve had iPhones since they were introduced.Frustratingly they are very good hence continuing my/love hate relationship.I upgraded from the iPhone 11 Pro which I thought was excellent.The camera on the 11 Pro was superb plus things like it’s waterproofing was reassuring.I upgraded for irrational reasons but I don’t regret it.I did find this nonsense game of having to wait an inordinate amount of time from”launch” to being able to buy somewhat boring and completely unnecessary.I also went for the Max version which I wasn’t sure about.I don’t have big hands and it seemed to big for being easy to carry around in my trouser pockets.This is still something I haven’t got fully used to but I do find the larger display much easier to use.I temporarily borrowed the 11 Pro and it seemed “tiny” although I never thought this when I owned one!!I’m not sure how much further Apple can take the Camera technology which is quite frankly outstanding.I was offered a “free” Apple introduction to my new iPhone which I had to book in advance but this was a let down offering nothing of any material value.In spite of Apple producing great Smart Phones I really struggle with their business model which I sense could collapse like a pack of cards when something really innovative comes along.But until that day comes I guess I’ll stick with what I know, but don’t love!

Beh, non c è molto da dire. Questo Iphone ha una batteria infinita. La qualità dei materiali e delle finiture è spettacolare. Difficilmente si può trovare un prodotto con questa qualità. Ovviamente il prezzo è alto, ma offre un prodotto eccezionale. Ormai li ho avuti tutti e non cambierò sicuramente

The phone was in perfect condition! Really something to change your opinion on refurbished devices.I was particularly fond of the packaging! Thought was clearly put into waste and the came with a charging cable and plug (not original, but no way a problem at all).The battery ‘health’ was at 100% which was incredible to see, so not sure if this was changed, or whether the phone was very new (certainly looked it).FaceRecognition wise I have yet to try, will update if any issues! (Thought I very much doubt it with the way it came).Only problem, is I’d knock £100-200 off the price, because, well, why not ;) , but in all seriousness, perfect condition and happy so far!

A good seller who replies within 1 day.Phones are in quite good condition. Packaging can be improved. Price is very decent. The devices should be cleaned better before they get dispatched to the customers.I got 1 x iphone 13 pro max 256gb ""excellent"" condition which was excellent indeed. 94% battery but I had to spend some time cleaning the edges and cameras of the phone from dirt.I also ordered 1 x iphone 13 pro 256gb accidentally ""excellent condition"". This was not a real excellent since it came with lots of scratches on the screen. the battery life was 99% though.Overall, I recommend the seller since you're backed up by Amazon. He communicates well and he listens to his customers
"
6011,B09MGFJN9R,4,"
The phone arrived with no damage to the outside which is to be expected as I ordered it in “excellent condition” it seems to be working well no problems noticed yet, only had it for over a week, battery life was 91% which is what disappointed me the most as I would expect higher for this condition.
"
6012,B09MGFJN9R,5,"
Looks like new, works like new. Genuinely can’t see a single scratch. Battery life is still at 97% which is grand. Arrived early, cameras and Face ID all work. Screen is likely the original as True Tone still works. You just need to have a paper clip handy to get the sim tray open because it doesn’t come with the original packaging (pretty standard for refurbished phones in my experience). Great phone, should last well!

The phone is literally like a brand new phone. There is 1 tiny scratch on the screen which you cannot notice unless you try to look for it and the battery life is fantastic. The battery health is 98% which is practically new. Would highly recommend buying this over a brand new phone as you get more or less a new phone for much cheaper price

I had this phone for nearly a month and most of my friends were complaining about sound quality . I actually thought that they might not have good signal because of the wind , but it was poorly for Wi-Fi too. Kind of feeling bad for blaming their devices for the fault.It is cutting through phrases and freeze on video call. FaceTime is glitching and it is not from iOS because I have another 12 pro max which has no issues.I requested to return the item, but this is a small inconvenience. The rest of the phone is great, but if you can’t talk to the phone it is a BIG issue.

I have upgraded my iPhone 11 Pro Max to the 13 Pro Max.If you’re debating going for the new 14 Plus, I would instead look into purchasing a renewed 13 Pro Max. Not only do both phones have most of the same features, the 13 Pro Max also has ProMotion 120hz display which is an extremely noticeable difference moving from the 11 Pro Max.People will most certainly have different experiences buying a renewed phone, however I received mine in almost pristine condition (only a slight hair line scratch at the bottom of the screen, only visible in certain angles), the battery is at 99% health which is basically a new phone.All in all I would recommend going for a renewed phone if you’re looking so save the extra £££ and still receive the latest features.

Iphones hot spot is complete and utter garbage and I'm not the only one that's noticed. I used to use my 10yr old Samsung S8s hotspot for everything. It wasn't even 5g enabled. It was consistent, devices connected automatically and there was no problems. After switching to iPhone I never thought I'd be stepping back 15 yrs. I now effectively do not have a hot spot. Devices do not connect automatically (Even my Mac which connects without fail to my old android) if devices do connect they regularly disconnect and or just stop working. I had never seen the exclamation mark symbol on the wifi status bar on Mac until I regrettably switched to iPhone. iPhone doesn't even let you go in and see what is connected to the hot spot either, you just have to guess. The way you have to make the hotspot discoverable is ridiculous too, you need to leave it on the settings screen, but if you're using an app like trying to get an Alexa or a smart watch connected you have to come off it, so its no longer discoverable. I had to use my android to connect my Alexa to my iPhone. Just ridiculous, no option to make hot spot permanently discoverable but I suppose it's neither here nor there because it often doesn't work anyway! I write this review on my Mac with my iPhone plugged in via USB and wifi off because surprise surprise, the hot spot isn't working. Please note I've wasted countless hours on resetting network settings and trying this that and the other thing. The problem is it's an iPhone and iPhones have absolutely garbage connectivity and no amount of resetting or changing settings will change that. There is countless online threads on iPhones non existent hotspot, some of which go back years. it's 2023 and iPhone still acts like it's 2004 and tethering doesn't yet exist. Will be changing back to android asap

I purchased the refurbished iphone 13 pro max, and i cannot lie, i could not point out a single flaw.

I have upgraded from iPhone 12 Pro and what a difference!+ 120Hz ProMotion display is buttery smooth and superb;+ battery life is exceptional (lasts all day easily with a very heavy use!);+ A15 is a power monster of a processor and nothing can hold it back;+ 6GB of RAM is more than enough and iOS runs like a rocket;+ very premium feel and perfect finish, which as always is expected from Apple;My main 2 reason for upgrading was superb battery life (compared to 12 Pro)and 120Hz high refresh rate display. Those 2 reasons are big enough reasonsand massive improvements that a phone is worth upgrading to!

I initially was going to return the phone as there was a very visible scratch on the screen. I changed my mind as it is a reconditioned phone. I purchased a screen protector and all at the moment is good. The phone itself is easy to use and a little bigger than I am used to but I am pleased.

Well like most people I needed a new phone, especially with my old Iphone 5 (yes I know, a relic) no longger being supported by IOS and of course it was on the way out which is no good especially for social media uploading such as YoutubeI knew I wanted another Iphone but I don't spend enough to warrant a contract, so I looked around and found the Iphone 11; a new one was quite expensive though and not wanting to part with that kind of cash, I went for a refurbished/renewed oneThe Iphone 11 arrived a few days after purchase (I went for the excellent condition) and I must say I was highly impressed; the phone itself looked brand new and I couldn't see any marks whatsoeverThe battery life was 91% which I thought was good, even though most are 80%-90%; the phone runs incredibly fast and the camera is excellentThere was also no dust on the speakers of the phone and the set up was dead easy, I do recommended getting a case as well as gorilla glass screen protectorsWould I buy another renewed/refurbished phone....hell yes I would!!

Let's make it clear I really really wanted to love this new-to-me phone. Initially, it was a brilliant upgrade from my iphone7.  Sadly, there were signs of things not going right quite soon after purchase (approximately 2 months ... a general 'lag time' when using certain apps or functions).  It occurred sporadically initially, so I just ignored it & hoped it would spontaneously resolve (in retrospect, not my smartest idea).  Closing down the phone & restarting it seemed to resolve the problem at first, so I persisted.I had registered the phone for its 1 year warranty, so I was confident I had a year to test out the phone see if it could serve its purpose.Four months from purchase, the phone gave up the ghost completely. Several goes were required to try to restart it. I breathed a sigh of relief when it came back to life.  Sadly, the phone was still not behaving reliably if at all and the battery was lasting less than half a day (when I managed to revive the phone), even then the phone would barely function. It had to be returned.It was stressful enough to have to purchase another phone & ensure all the data was transferred asap (who can survive for long without a phone these days?).  Iphone to android transfers are not designed to be a user-friendly process, and there was the added expense of course.  However, as I was well within my 12 month warranty period & it was clearly a defective item to start with, I was confident of a full refund .Although the sellar was prompt in their responses at first, they were far less than reasonable. They deducted 40% from my refund for the time the phone was used! When I politely queried this, they quoted Amazon policy that ""new items had to be returned unused & in original condition for a full refund"" (note this item was NOT new); and ""used items, needed to be returned with no additional damage"".  Ignoring the fact I had indeed returned to them their Used & Defective, not fit-for-purpose item with no additional damage.  They also added the ""small deduction"" was made for time the phone had been used!Firstly, how is 40% for 4 months use, (not all of which was with a fully functioning phone), a ""small"" deduction?  Secondly, how could I know the item was defective without using it?!They have now stopped responding to me (unsurprisingly) & I will have to take this further via Amazon as the sellar is being ridiculous and unreasonable, if not acting outright illegally. It cannot be Ok for the company to charge 10% (monthly) of the full cost of a refurbished defective item, for its use! More than likely it will be sold on again (they did indeed tell me the phone had been fixed & would post back to me) to another unsuspecting customer. Obviously I declined their offer.Please consider if you want to get yourself into a similar position with this most unscrupulous sellar who clearly is not interested in supplying goods that actually work.

Phone received in good order aside from poor sound coming out of the earpiece. Fortunately, this was caused by dirt and was easily fixed by cleaning the earpiece.I had to immediately update the phone to iOS 15.7 but this wasn't a big deal. One just needs a decent internet connection.Battery health is at 86% which is lower than I had hoped for but well above the minimum promise of 80%. This is still enough to take me through the day without worry.Face ID worked perfectly! :)Willing to buy again if the need arises.

My iPhone arrived within a few days offl placing my order, in a plain box with an unbranded charger and genuine Apple lightning cable which was fine. Condition was excellent with no scratches, scuffs or marks to the phone body or screen. Battery capacity indicated to be 88% which seemed quite good.I have been using the handset now for almost 2 weeks and it lives up to the IOS mantra, having an iPad and an iCloud account set up was very easy.I was really surprised at how chunky and heavy the handset feels in comparison to my Android smartphone, there is also a lot more bezel around the screen, which means the screen tends to appear smaller. This means that some apps present quite differently on screen which takes some getting used to. This is a return to IOS as my last was an iPhone 7 and although iphones have got bigger the handsets seem to have become thicker. This was really noticeable once I bought a Spigen case and made it a little awkward using the iPhone one handed.The quality of sound via Bluetooth is very good whether on a headset or in the car it just seems richer than the sound from my Android handset. I think this was largely down to being able to apply a loudness setting to the audio output which is not present on my Android device.Overall I would definately recommend looking at purchasing a renewed/refurbished device on Amazon as I saved over £150 on the price of a new one. As long as you don't mind it not arriving in Apple packaging etc and not being at 100% battery health why not?As with all Apple products there are the guaranteed software updates and the promise of a relatively pain free user experience.

I received my iPhone 11, very quickly and well packaged, I was pleased to see it included a new charger and lead. The phone was in an unused condition, without a chip or mark on it. My only disappointment was, I was changing phones purely because my iPhone 8’s battery had dropped to 78%. The 11 was showing a disjappointmenting 85%, and still struggles to make the day
"
6088,B082BHJ9G8,5,"
The phone looks like new & I like the screen size, the battery lasts quite some time as well (maximum battery capacity says 88%). Hesitated to purchase as it was a lot of money but am so glad I made the plunge. I tried an iPhone X before this but found it got hot quickly & the battery didn't last long (even though the battery capacity said 100%) so I returned that one for a refund. I have not felt this phone get hot as yet. I am so glad I went for this one.

I recently purchased refurbished iphone 11.  Stated was in good condition.  Was in excellent condition - no scratches on screen.  I also got a cover for it and tempered glass screen protectors, which were not mentioned in the description.  The phone came with charger and cable as stated and delivery was excellent also.  Would defo. recommend.

6092,B082BHJ9G8,5,"
So happy with my new iPhone 11. Arrived really quickly with an after-market (but new) charger and cable. I’d paid for the best quality renewed phone available, so was disappointed with the battery life on the one I was sent. Contacted customer services, who - without question- asked me to return the phone (for free) and within 3 or 4 days, I had it back with a brand new battery fitted. Couldn’t be happier with the phone or the customer service, wouldn’t hesitate to recommend, or buy from again.
"
6093,B082BHJ9G8,4,"
The battery came with 85% of useful life!!  I was not very satisfied with it, I wish it was more useful life.  I need him a lot because I work with him, if I had time I would like to change him.  But the rest is very good
"
6094,B082BHJ9G8,4,"
The phone is in perfect condition physically and keeps its charge well. The worrying issue was that when I first started using it there was an Apple alert flagging that the screen had been changed.There had been no mention of this in either the listing or the literature that came with the phone. I've only ever bought used iphones (and always via Amazon) and this is the first time that this has happened.Occasionally the screen does not seem to be responsive, but overall it's not an issue.Overall the phone works ok.

Hi I have just bought a 128GB iPhone 11 from 4 gadgets, the service was fast and I had my phone within a couple of days. Unfortunately the phone that arrived was a 64GB It was in excellent condition just not enough space. And obviously a small mistake had been made, no big deal mistakes happen! I depend on my phone for work so all the time it was away I couldn’t work and lost out on quite a bit of money! I called up and spoke to Julia who couldn’t have been kinder and did everything within her power to help resolve the issue, the phone was sent back and the right one delivered the next day, Thank you Julia for helping me I really appreciate all you did for me..The phone is I good working order the only issue is the Battery health is at 90% and won’t charge past 95% so I’ll need to change the battery soon. Will have to do for now as can’t afford anymore time off work.

Battery 87% was thinking to send it back it’s a present for Christmas the paint around the charging port has also come off and there’s a small deep scratch in the screen I think they should state the quality of the iPhone before you buy it I looked through so many and so many reviews went for this one and I am a bit disappointed but hopefully they like it. Other than that screen works microphone works camera works and it charges just disappointed with the few marks but good price

6098,B082BHJ9G8,5,"
Fantastic !! Just as a great as a brand new one !! Battery life is fantastic01/12/22 had this 6mths now and you wouldn’t know it’s refurbished, it looks and feels brand new !! Will definitely be buying refurbished products in the future

when bought had software problems and contacted the seller for help, but they were not interested and stated that software problems was a apple problem and to contact apple, also the battery was not an apple battery so did flag a battery problem, which now a month later has stopped, very disappointed with this company and the problems that came with it at the price, not a happy customer, your's Kev.

Got this phone for my son as couldn't  afford a brand new one of this make.  He has had it for some time now,  plays lots of games on it,  and it still Happy with it.
"
6102,B082BHJ9G8,4,"
The phone arrived without scratches at all, looks brand new on the outside. Battery health was 87% and not performing as new but still solid.Definitely worth it over paying full price for a new phone.
"

6105,B082BHJ9G8,5,"
So far 10 out of 10 apart from a message saying it’s not a genuine apple part for the display, does not seem to be causing any problems, all my emails apps work, phoning people no problem I can hear them and they can hear me, as I have bought unlocked phones before and my friends said I sounded like I was under water! I phone 11 is about 700 pounds new so to by this for 349 and the only issue is a pop warning about the display it’s a bargain
"

Not as described, sides are very scratched and the battery life is only 85%. Not in as new condition…

I was apprehensive about buying a reconditioned phone but I was completely wrongPhone is practically new, no surface scratches, excellent battery life with only charging once per day. Fast, reliable and efficient delivery.Would definitely recommend

6108,B082BHJ9G8,5,"
I bought an IPhone 11 the day I broke my phone and it was delivered the next working day, sooner than the expected delivery date. Initially, I was skeptical due to the low cost but the phone has arrived in perfect, like new condition, with no scratches on the screen or cameras. It also came with an Apple charger and other accessories. The battery health is at 83% which I am happy with and the phone works as it should. Overall very happy, fantastic quality for the money.
"
6109,B082BHJ9G8,1,"
Despite a gaurentee of over 80% battery life, the battery was only at 75%. I sent back using the label provided a month ago but the seller is denying receipt so won’t refund me. They are now saying I should have incurred costs by sending recorded delivery. I’ve reached out to Amazon but no response so far.

6110,B082BHJ9G8,5,"
I needed a new iphone but didn't want to buy new for environmental reasons - rather renewed. I was apprehensive though but was recommended buying via Amazon by my daughter who had done the same and was very pleased.Phone arrived the next day which was a lovely surprise as delivery date had been 6 days (due to upcoming new year holidays). One small scratch on the screen but apart from that in excellent condition and works just like a new phone. Would recommend.

Just bought one came a day after they posted it which was the first working day after I ordered.The phone is in perfect condition, no scratches on the phone at all. The battery health is at 89%.It did not come in an original Apple box but they say it won’t on the info so not fussed. Came with usb cable, UK usb plug and a sim remover tool.Overall I’m very happy with the phone and would recommend Loop-Mobile.

This renewed IPhone 11 was a great deal. Works as new, looks as new and feels as new. Battery capacity was 93% and it lasts for 2-3 days before recharge. Let it drop to about 10% and charge to full.

On 1st inspection item looked great, not a single mark to say it was used. (Excellent condition)When switched on it was very apparent that there was an issue with the screen. Top left hand corner - no pixels at all. (This should have been noticed on testing)Had to argue and threaten legal action to get a refund. Not a great experience.

I'm extremely disappointed with the quality of the phone.  There are multiple scratches on the screen, the back of the phone and scratches around the camera lense itself.  There is a lot of sticky material at the top of the phone.  I paid extra for an 'excellent' refurbished phone, but this certainly does not meet my expectations!!
"
6135,B082BHJ9G8,5,"
The phone is as advertised. Working condition, well protected in transit. I’ve only had it on for a day, but so far it’s functioning perfectly.It did arrive with fingerprints on it, but they were easy to clean off. Overall, can’t complain.

So I took a chance after reading some poor reviews and it was well worth it. Phone battery charges to 98% . There is not a single mark on the screen. It’s as if it was new. Everything works as it should.  An excellent 128gb space top notch and delivery was very quick.

I wanted to buy the iPhone 14 pro max but it was out of stock at the time, this phone was my second choice and I’m honestly glad I bought it. Despite lacking a few of the flagship features found in the 14 pro,(such as a 120 hertz display, a few camera upgrades and the dynamic island) it still punches above its weight it terms of quality. After looking at the specifications of this phone and comparing it to the pro model, there are far more similarities than differences. The camera is still spectacular and apart from the macro lens, you would struggle to see the differences in pictures taken with both phones. To summarise, it’s a great phone that’s worth the money
"
6166,B0BDHYZ6ZN,5,"
Apple return to making a large version of their normal handset for the first time since the 8 plus and what a brilliant bit of kit it is.I find the cameras on a standard iPhone superb and more than good enough for my needs. For the iPhone 12 & 13 I’ve had to get the Pro Max to get the larger screen.Don’t get me wrong, the pro max is a great phone but unless you’re a serious photographer it’s likely the camera’s never going to reach its potential with the average user.Being able to buy the 256GB version of the standard iPhone for more or less the price of the 128GB pro Max is a real yes please moment.As an avid product red buyer I’m also delighted to be able to go back to red. The Pro Max has never been available in any of the colours I like so I’ve always hidden it in a case.The iPhone 14 Plus is fast, the battery life a massive improvement, the cameras are excellent and the price point, whilst expensive, offers the average user more for their money.
"
6167,B0BDHYZ6ZN,5,"
Purchased the new iPhone 14 after getting fed up with my old iPhone 6s for a year or so?This is great technology and although it was expensive, Amazon at least gave me 5% off. Could not get anything as trade-in from Apple, so this was a bonus. Changing over to the new iPhone is now very easy.
"
6168,B0BDHYZ6ZN,5,"
I never had a plus iPhone and I didn't want to spend that much money to get the Pro Max, so this iPhone 14 plus was perfect, the size of the phone and the battery are great.

6173,B0BDHYZ6ZN,5,"
I love this phone. I've never had an iPhone so from my perspective this item is insanely good.The screen is large, battery lasts long and the camera is extremely good (it supersedes what I had on my previous phones). It's expensive but worth the money.However, from what I understood, the refresh frame on the screen on the Plus version is a bit lower than the Pro. So perhaps if you are picky when it comes to iphones, look into that because it might bother you. It doesnt bother me at all (due to my previous phone being total garbo).5/5 stars! Love it :)

Not much change from the 13 series but I come from series 11. It’s a huge leap. Amazing camera. Very fast. Clear screen. Amazing camera. Brilliant operating system. Crash detection on this model. Get at least 256gb one as you’ll need it. You will need to pay iCloud storage too as 5gb free isn’t enough.

The iPhone 14 Plus is extremely bad value. Apart from a slightly larger screen, there are no standout features that make this superior than last years iPhone 13. Even worse, if you pay a little bit more, you can get the flagship iPhone 14 Pro! My biggest question is who did Apple make this for?!

J’ai mis 2 mois à me décider, entre choisir un iPhone 14 , 14 plus ou 13 pro max … désirant un écran assez grand le choix c’est donc fait entre la qualité photo du 13 pro max et la légèreté et l’autonomie du 14 plus . Perso mon utilité personnelle se contente de l’objectif du 14 plus ( et il est déjà pas mal !) question autonomie croyez le ou non le 14 plus me fait 48 h voir plus ! ( jeux , réseaux , Visio …) le 13 pro max pour la même utilité fait un peu moins de 48h (testé) . J’ai donc opté pour le 14 plus et j’en suis ravi, le prix reste élevé mais justifié pour un iPhone de ce genre

Migrating from a iPhone 7 plus after long five years, where the single complaint was battery life, I decided for an upgrade. No charger was provided, but at the end, I've accumulated so many, that this was really not an issue. But a USB-C cable was provided, which is a good help for faster charging. Migrating Apps and settings was really the best experience I had: By starting the new Phone I've had the option for migration, which required just a confirmation on my old device. Passwords were ""automagically"" transferred and in less than one hour everything landed on the new device. Everything was working, including Apple CarPlay and other Apple stuff. Third party Apps were almost Ok, except for very special cases like Bank Account Apps and Authenticators.Other concern was FaceID, since the previous used the fingerprint sensor, but this also worked like a charm, after following the configuration wizard.

Certes l’iPhone et iOS sont une combinaison parfaite. L’écran est très agréable pour naviguer, visionner des vidéos, jouer. Une finition et des matériaux de bonnes factures. Un poids contenu malgré sa taille. Mais le prix, le prix… cher pour une appareil qui ne profite que d’un écran plus grand et recycle le processeur de la génération précédente. Rien de nouveau pour le reste, si vous désirez rester au format plus compact, alors prenez un iPhone 13, le 14 ne vous apportera rien de plus, enfin si, une facture plus salée.

Super schnelle Lieferung und Abwicklung. Beim starten hat er zwar ein Update verlangt, aber war nicht schlimm. Ich kann im allgemeinen noch nicht viel darüber sagen, da ich es noch komplett einrichten muss und mir ein Panzerglas drauf machen lassen möchte. Es ist schon recht groß im Gegensatz zum alten und schwerer. Aber man wusste ja die Größe des Handys laut Hersteller. Wie es sich im Alltag bewährt, wird sich raus stellen. Ich muss es jetzt in Ruhe einrichten. Farbe finde ich okay. Vielleicht in ein paar Monaten mehr.

Bin vom Iphone 12 umgestiegen da ich, ende fünfzig, einfach ein wenig größere Buchstaben brauche (scheiß Altersweitsichtigkeit). Ich bin äußerst zufrieden mit dem Wechsel, whatsapp, Zeitung, Email  etc. sind jetzt (zur Not) auch ohne Lesebrille lesbar. Das Pro max war mir schlicht zu teuer, dessen sicher super Kamera wäre für meine Bedürfnisse überzogen, die Kamera des ""normalen"" 14/14 plus ist schon super für mich. Ob 60 hz oder 120 hz Anzeige ist mir egal, ich bin kein Gamer. Alles in Allem ein tolles, großes Telefon mit dem man für die nächsten Jahre bedient sein wird.  Ansonsten ist es natürlich unübertroffen wie Apple alles zu einen Ökosystem zusammengeführt hat, Iphone, Ipad, Iwatch und Apple TV harmonieren perfekt zusammen, ohne das übliche Geärgere wie bei Android üblich sobald es um mehr als ein Gerät geht.Update nach ein paar Tagen Nutzung im Vergleich zum iPhone pro max meiner Freundin: was sofort auffällt ist dass das Pro deutlich schwerer ist, meiner Freundin ist es egal, deren Handy ist in der Handtasche die eh ungefähr 2 kg Kram enthält, ich habe das Handy in der Jacke, da ist mir das leichte Plus deutlich lieber. Der zweite große Unterschied ist der Akku, das Plus schafft bei mir fast zwei Tage, das Pro nur gut einen.Ich bin auch nach dem Vergleich sehr zufrieden mit der Entscheidung für das Plus und gegen das Pro

Ich bin sehr zufrieden mit dem Smartphone. Dass es sich hierbei nicht um das 120 Hz Display handelt, fällt eigentlich nicht auf. Nur wenn man es mit diesem vergleicht, im normalen Gebrauch merkt man es nicht außer vielleicht beim Spielen eines Spiels. Ansonsten ist es wirklich sehr gut in der Verwendung, der Akku hält wirklich lange und auch die Kamera macht gute Fotos.Insgesamt finde ich das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis deutlich besser gegenüber den pro Varianten.

Le téléphone est arrivé sans problème via le transporteur, un code est demandé pour garantir la livraison et la boîte est scellée.Je dirai juste que j'ai été surpris de ne pas trouver d'écouteur filaires, pour un tel prix ce serait le minimum sachant qu'Apple fait déjà pas mal d'économie sur le chargeur qui n'est pas fourni non plus.Il n'y a pas non plus de coque ni de protège écran...Le contenu de la boîte se résume au téléphone et au câble usb-c vers lightning. Pour un tel prix on pourrait s'attendre au minimum à avoir un protège écran basique et une coque, le temps d'acheter le nécessaire pour faire mieux.

Wie immer bei Apple, ein top gerät. Die preispolitik bezüglich des speichers ist zwar fragwürdig mit ca 400€ differenz zwischen 128GB und 1TB. Aber mir persönlich reichen 128GB in dem fall. Es ist kein schnäpchen und die arbeitsumstände sollen ja auch nicht die besten sein, doch das müssen die verantwortlichen in den griff bekommen.Im vergleich zu android läuft beim iphone alles flüssig und das gefällt mir.Wer auf ein paar spielereien wie die kameranotch und die kamera pro funktionen verzichten kann aber trotzdem die größe des pro max möchte macht hier nichts falsch. Wenns vom geld her geht. In schulden sollte sich keiner wegen einem smartphone stürzen nur um mithalten zu können. Auch sollte man vielleicht vorher das smartphone mal in der hand haben und das normale mit dem plus vergleichen. Das normale liegt top in der hand, das plus erfordert schon öfters mal beide hände. Somit könnte man sich eventuell paar hundert euro sparen und das normale mit 6,1 zoll nehmen. Es ist auf jedenfall ein unterschied der sich auch in der hosentasche bemerkbar macht.

This iPhone is a huge step up from any other I’ve ever seen or used and I’ve had iPhones since the iPhone 3g. The camera is stunning and I’m a semi-professional photographer. I’m not going into a deep review of it all but suffice to say it really does live up to the hype for once, and that’s rare!The screen is stunningly clear and simply gorgeous to look at. The whole phone really makes the very most of the latest iOS 16.1 operating system but by the time you read this it will have been developed even further for sure. Using this phone is just a dream and if you’re in a 5G area, you will be blown away by its speed.This is technology at its very best and if you want the best mobile phone available today, I heartily recommend you go for this. It even has a battery that will get you through an entire long day! Not that it matters too much as I can charge mine from empty to 80% in under an hour.This isn’t the place for the kind of review this phone deserves but I can say with confidence you will not regret buying it.As a side issue, my friend and I ordered our phones on the exact same day, he from Apple and me from Amazon. I got my phone at least two weeks before he did!

 Upgraded from 12 pro max, & it was a genuine improvement. The notch has gone & has been replaced by a much smaller version, but with a mini screen/readout. Cameras are vastly improved along with screen & refresh rate.  Not impressed with the new esim!! Couldn’t put old sim in this latest apple effort & get it up & running straight away. Now having to figure out how to transfer my old number?!

When I first got the iPhone 14 pro max it was fantastic but just after one week sometimes the screen doesn’t respond and is very frustrating closing down the app and reopen it just to get it working .all in all this phone is not worth the money and the only difference in the pictures it takes is only noticeable when you crop the picture so unless your a photographer but then you would have a decent camera it don’t make any sense to get this phone and the always on bit I switched off lol

I’m gonna be realI’ve come from some generations behind but notice nothing yeah the dynamic island is cool and speaks that this is the new phone but you’ll never use it past answering calls and media playback….the phone is neverchanging and thus you end up with a reshaped version of the same thing we been getting since the iPhone 11Say what you will but the phone is mid, the delivery waiting time is beyond words (not at all worth waiting months for rather get another phone)And thus in conclusion ….. think carefully before spending on this it all depends on your financial standing and value of this productBless up fellow mindless consumers !

So after a good few years of Samsung phones, we return to Apple, and what a huge disappointment. Forget that the Samsung Galaxy S22 is an Android phone and not iOS (duh!), it's so much smaller, so comparing the two is exactly fair, but the idea was that Apple's flagship would exceed Samsung, it simply doesn't. The camera was worse for us too, but maybe for others, it isn't. As for iOS, yes is speedy, very swish, and the battery life is really good. But those were the only two positives for us. The display on the Samsung still stuns, the display on this iPhone is nothing bad, but nothing special either, for this much money, better was not just expected, it was a necessity. This review will probably get a 1000 downvotes, but we felt conned buying this by reviewers raving about it, are they all paid to do so? Sold it three weeks later and went back to the S22 Ultra. Lost £100 in the process, so not happy about that. If you're thinking of buying one, try the S22 Ultra, unless you're locked into iOS, it will impress.

This iPhone is the same built from the iPhone 12 Pro Max. The only difference between them is iPhone 14 pro max has Dynamic Island not the notch.  And Always-On display AndProMotion technology with adaptive refresh rates up to 120Hz. Apart from that you are buying  the phone twice. Just minor upgrades. Apple need to innovate.
"
6270,B0BDJ9B66D,1,"
This review is not about the phone quality, it is about Apples customer service. I ordered the iPhone 14 Pro Max on 19th September and the money was taken a few days later on 23rd.Delivery was shown as by 23rd October. It is now 27th October and the delivery info has changed to ‘we will email you when it is in stock’.It’s bad enough having these extended waiting times, but what other business takes the full payment with no realistic delivery time for the item?You can’t even contact them!

Basically the same as the previous phone. no need to upgrade.

Amazing screen, volume clarity improved, CAMERA SYSTEM is the best. Every shot you click, it's gonna be the best shot you've ever clicked on any mobile phones.Dynamic Island is simply superb, while listening to music, receiving air drops, ring/silent. On every action you do , the island responds and it's styles are good.On a last note, it's the beast.

It has a nice feel to it the screen brightness is very good and fast to open the app and closing the app.I did not like waiting 10 weeks to receive my iPhone it should have been shipped to me by the 28/09 not the 1/12.I have used iPhone 13pro max the performance wise their is not much of a different between 14pro max to 13pro max some one who going use it day to day doze not care for the brightness of screen or the dynamic island if you can get a good deal on a 13pro max go for it.

Nachdem ich ein iPhone 12 Pro Max von Herbst 2020 in Verwendung habe, bei dem mir die Speicherkapazität langsam nicht mehr ausreicht und ich die Video-Verbesserungen seit dem iPhone 13 Pro interessant finde, ist jetzt die Zeit für ein neues iPhone.Das iPhone 14 Pro Max ist wieder sehr hochwertig verarbeitet und weiter im bewerten Design seit dem iPhone 12, dass schon an Generationen 4 bis iPhone 5S erinnert.Für mich wichtigste Neuerungen: -Haupt-Kamera deutlich verbessert mit bis zu 48 Megapixel! Allerdings im Alltag nur weiterhin 12 Megapixel und somit wohl kaum Größenunterschied der Dateien. Gut, denn wer mehr Pixel voll ausnutzen will, kann auf RAW umstellen (viel Bearbeitungs-Potential, aber riesige Dateien), bei normalen Fotos hingegen wird einfach die Qualität verbessert.  Die Brennweite entspricht jetzt einem 24mm, also etwas mehr Weitwinkel (13 Pro: 26mm).-Ultraweitwinkel-Kamera verbessert, soll auch bei Macro-Aufnahmen besser sein-2fach Zoom wieder da: Wie beim iPhone XS kann man nun wieder auch 2fach Zoom optisch nutzen - ein Bildausschnitt der Hauptkamera statt eine eigene Linse. Nachteil: Vermutlich weniger Qualität bei schwierigerem Licht, als bei 3x-Kamera-Super Retina XDR Display: Das Display soll sich noch weiter verbessert haben. Es scheint mit enorm brillant und scharf. In hellen Umgebungen soll es sogar bis zu 2000 Nits Helligkeit bieten, also auch bei starker Sonneneinstrahlung noch hell genug sein (bis zu doppelt so hell wie vorherige iPhones). Allerdings kann sich das Display bei warmer Umgebung und gleichzeitigem Laden per Powerbank etc. eventuell dimmen und nicht mehr die volle Helligkeit bieten, das fand ich beim 12 Pro Max problematisch und kann es bisher beim 14 Pro Max noch nicht beurteilen.-Neuer Prozessor bzw. Chip mit vermutlich etwas mehr Leistung, im Vergleich zum normalen iPhone 14, das weiterhin mit dem Prozessor vom Vorjahr kommt (nur 1 Grafikkern mehr ist im normalen iPhone 14 nutzbar nutzbar, wie beim 13 Pro).-Always-On Display: Wie der Name sagt, kann das Display permanent an bleiben und bei niedriger Bild-Wiederholrate energiesparend Infos anzeigen. Kann z.B. am Schreibtisch auf einem Ladeständer ganz praktisch sein… Wenn man das iPhone umdreht oder in die Tasche steckt, sollte sich das Display aber nach wie vor ganz abschalten.-Dynamic Island: Statt der bisherigen Frontkamera- und Gesichtserkennungs-Einbuchtung am oberen Displayrand, gibt es jetzt eben einen kleineren, abgetrennten Bereich, der zusätzlich rundherum den Display-Bereich einbindet, um Infos wie Musikwiedergabe etc. anzuzeigen. Eine nette Spielerei, die aktuell nur der 14 Pro-Serie vorbehalten ist.-Kinomodus (für Videoaufnahme) weiter verbessert und in 4KVorteile im Vergleich zu älteren Geräten (für alle, die überlegen, umzusteigen):-LiDAR Scanner (seit 12 Pro): Zukunftssicherer -ein großer Vorteil für Fotografie und Filmen bei wenig Licht, verbessert den Auto-Fokus der Kamera. Außerdem wird es vermutlich zunehmend mehr AR-Anwendungen etc. geben, welche von dem neuen Scanner gebrauch machen können.-Ultra-Weitwinkel-Kamera zusätzlich im Vergleich zu iPhone XS oder älter-Tele-Objektiv mit 3 fachem „Zoom“ zum im Vergleich zum iPhone 12 Pro (Max) (2,5fach Zoom) oder nur 2 fache „Zoom“ bei iPhone XS oder älter-Fotoqualität bei wenig Licht noch mal deutlich verbessert, im Vergleich zu älteren iPhones (Generation XS und abwärts) finde ich den Unterschied gigantisch, besonders auch bei Videoaufnahmen in Dämmerung… seit dem iPhone 12 noch einiges verbessert.-Kamera im 14 Pro Max sensorstabilisiert -also noch besserer Schutz vor Verwackeln bzw. Vorteile für Videoaufnahmen. Ein großer Vorteil zu älteren Generationen vor iPhone 12-Action Modus: Für Videoaufnahmen in Bewegung eine deutliche Verbesserung, seit iPhone 13 Pro (Max), kann manchmal einen Gimbal einsparen… allerdings nicht bei voller Auflösung.-In bis zu 1 TB Kapazität erhältlich, seit dem iPhone 13 Pro (Max)-Apple ProRAW-Foto-Unterstützung (seit iPhone 12 Pro). Man kann in der Nachbearbeitung mehr mit den Fotos machen (Farben anpassen etc.), allerdings deutlich größere Speichergröße. Natürlich jederzeit umschaltbar.-ProRes und Dolby Vision HDR Video: Lässt sich aktivieren um extrem hochwertige, gut bearbeitbare Videos aufzunehmen, z.B. ideal für Nutzer, die danach in Final Cut Pro schneiden möchten etc… Natürlich entsprechend hoher Speicherbedarf.  Verfügbar seit iPhone 13 Pro bzw. 12 Pro bei Dolby Vision HDR.-6 GB Arbeitsspeicher (RAM) -kein Fortschritt im Vergleich zu den Vorgängern seit iPhone 12, aber im Vergleich zu älteren iPhones (vor 12) oder Nicht-Pro Modellen.-lange Zeit Updates: Im Vergleich zu den meisten Android-Geräten wesentlich längere Unterstützung von neuen Betriebssystem-Versionen mit vielen neuen Funktionen und sogar darüber Hinaus noch Sicherheitsupdates.-iOS entwickelt sich zunehmend weiter und bringt jedes Jahr wesentliche Neuerungen auch für alte Geräte.-Guter Wasser-Schutz (nach IP 68) -seit dem iPhone 12 eine deutliche Verbesserung zu Vorgängern-5G-Unterstützung: Wer noch iPhones vor der 12. Generation nutzt, der bekommt hier auch eine interessante Verbesserung-Akku-Laufzeit im Max macht auf mich einen guten Eindruck. Ein ganzes Stück besser, als in der normalen Pro-Version… bisher konnte ich kaum Unterschiede zu älteren Max-Modellen feststellen.-MagSafe: magnetisches System zum Anschluss von Qi-Ladegeräten und anderem Zubehör an der Rückseite, seit dem iPhone 12 verbaut. Seit 2 Jahren erscheint immer mehr nützliches MagSafe-Zubehör, wie Auto-Halter, Ständer, Wallets und vieles mehr…-ein wenig größeres Display als etwas ältere Vorgänger-Modelle (11 Pro Max,  XS Max) - aber auch etwas größeres GehäuseNachteile:-Noch kein neuester WLAN-Standard wie 6E, immer noch die selbe maximale Geschwindigkeit und der selbe Standard wie schon seit Jahren, dadurch nicht so zukunftssicher-Leider immer neue Gehäusegrößen - so passen alte Hüllen nicht mehr… (MagSafe-Zubehör wie Wallet oder Ständer sind allerdings mit allen iPhones ab 12 kompatibel)-Kein Kopfhörer-Anschluss, wie schon seit dem iPhone 7. Kabel-Kopfhörer/Headsets lassen sich aber einfach per Lightning auf Klinke-Adapter anstecken, oder Zubehör direkt mit Lightning-Stecker (z.B. Apple EarPods).-Face ID im Vergleich zu Geräten mit Home-Button: Manchmal wäre das Entsperren mit dem Fingerabdruck-Sensor praktischer, wenn das iPhone z.B. flach am Tisch liegt. Das hat Apple am iPad Air im seitlichen Knopf integriert. Fände ich zusätzlich zu Face ID sehr wünschenswert.-Kein Netzteil/Ladegerät mehr im Lieferumfang seit iPhone 12. Aus Umweltgründen sind die dadurch verkleinerten Verpackungen zwar sicher ein Vorteil. Und viele Nutzer besitzen schon genug Ladegeräte, aber eben nicht jeder. Aber es gibt auch viele sehr günstige 18W oder 20W-USB C-Netzteile, die zumindest fast genauso schnell laden, wie das Original.-iPhone-Preise in der EU leider deutlich angestiegenNeutral:-Wohl kaum Verbesserung der Tele-Kamera, immer noch nicht mehr als 3x „Zoom“ bzw. mehr Tele-Brennweite. Die Konkurrenz bietet da teilweise deutlich mehr… Nur bei wenig Licht soll sich die Qualität verbessert haben, vermutlich aber nur per Software.-Lightning-Stecker: Ich finde den Lightning-Stecker der iPhones immer noch technisch sehr gut -die Kabel halten sehr gut und der Stecker ist ziemlich robust. Auch mehrfache Abstürze bei einigen iPhones direkt auf den Stecker haben bisher bei mir keinen Schaden verursacht. USB C scheint mir da etwas anfälliger und die Stecker brauchen auch ein wenig mehr Platz.Andererseits gibt es für USB C eben viel mehr Zubehör wie Docks und Adapter -da ist die Auswahl für Lightning leider begrenzter. Aber am Smartphone finde ich das nicht so wichtig, beim iPad finde ich USB C wichtiger. Adapter auf USB und SD-Kartenleser gibt es ja u.a. für Lightning auch.Fazit:Meiner Meinung nach ist das iPhone 14 Pro Max derzeit auf jeden Fall das technisch fortschrittlichste Smartphone am Markt. Die Max-Variante hat inzwischen wohl keine technischen Vorteile mehr zum normalen Pro, außer eben neben Display einem größeren Akku.Für Fotografen und Videofilmer sehe ich das iPhone 14 Pro (Max) jedenfalls als ideale Wahl. Die Videoqualität finde ich toll und für viele Foto-Aufgaben ist es schon komplett ausreichend, wenn auch weiterhin kein Smartphone Vollformat-DSLR/DSLM-Kameras ersetzen kann.Für Nutzer älterer Modelle: Wer noch ein iPhone 12 Pro (Max) nutzt, der wird vor allem deutliche Kamera-Fortschritte sicher zu schätzen wissen, vom 13 Pro(Max) sollte der Unterschied nicht besonders groß sein.Rein die Geschwindigkeit bei der Nutzung hat sich nach meinem Eindruck die letzten Jahre nur leicht verbessert und auch ein 11 Pro oder 12 Pro (Max) können bei den meisten Alltagsaufgaben sehr gut mithalten, selbst ein XS Max finde ich noch schnell genug - auch für etwas anspruchsvollere Nutzer.

Dieses Gerät stellt zwar nur ein minimales, aber solides Upgrade zum Vorgänger dar.Das Display ist knackig scharf und butterweich dank 120 Hz Bildwiederholrate. Der Sound ist super und auch beim Empfang 4G/5G, sowie Telefonie gibt es keine Beschwerden.Die Dynamic Island ist ein nettes Gimmick und wird hoffentlich noch mehr Anwendung finden als bisher.Ein Aufrüsten des Speichers ist nicht möglich, daher sollte vor dem Kauf abgewogen werden, was man braucht bzw. künftig brauchen wird.Mit 1 TB ist man aber immer gut bedient, da 4K Videos und RAW Fotodateien sehr viel Platz brauchen.Der Ultrawide Sensor ist noch immer nicht mit einer optischen Bildstabilisierung ausgestattet…das ist nicht gut, aber verschmerzbar. Der Unterschied der Kamera zum 13 Pro Max ist kaum vorhanden. Wer aber von einem 12er oder älter kommt, wird das Upgrade merken.Noch immer gibt es nur 6GB RAM. Hier wären 8GB mal überfällig.Jedoch weiß das neue Schwarz als Farbe sehr zu gefallen und passt ausnahmslos zu jeder Hülle.Auch hier klare Kaufempfehlung für Leute mit dem nötigen Kleingeld ;-)Auch muss Amazon lobend erwähnt werden, denn ich hatte das Gerät zunächst bei Apple selbst bestellt. Nach wochenlangem Warten stellte sich am Tag wo es ausgeliefert werden sollte und die Tage danach heraus, dass ein UPS Mitarbeiter wohl mehr Lust auf das Gerät und es einfach behalten hatte, obwohl ich es bezahlte…was in einem wochenlangen Hin und Her mündete. ABER bei Amazon lief alles reibungslos und unkompliziert ab. Hier wurde das Gerät sehr schnell und zufriedenstellend geliefert! Dafür nochmals vielen Dank, dass das hier alles SUPER läuft!!!!

Une nouvelle fois, c’est du grand Apple.Pas déçu de mon achat, c’est un achat plaisir que j’ai effectué, mais reste quelques détails à amélioré pour qu’il puisse être parfait.Ayant possédé l’iPhone 12, avant de passer vers l’iPhone 14 Pro Max, la différence se voit tout de suite au niveau de la taille de l’écran et surtout des 3 focus de l’appareil photo, c’est extra la plage d’effet et de filtre que propose l’application « appareil photo ».Côté design, c’est du grand classique étant une grande fan de la marque, c’est un design cylindrique et cette finition propre à la marque quand retrouvé depuis l’iPhone 4 et 4s.La grande nouveauté de cette iPhone 14 Pro Max c’est le Dynamic Island, qui est top, il permet l’affichage simple et intelligent des notifications sur le téléphone (notamment quand en reçoit des appels, messages etc).Pour moi, les futurs axes d’améliorations qu’Apple devrait prévoir sur les nouveaux modèles, c’est de voir le positionnement des objectifs de l’appareil photo qui pour moi commence à devenir redondant et du déjà vu, de plus je remarque que la qualité de l’appareil photo selfie n’est pas vraiment top.Le détecteur de réduction de bruit, n’est pas vraiment vraiment efficace dans des lieux très fréquentés (par ex : rue commerçantes, centre commercial etc). Il faut parfois faire répéter son interlocuteur pour entendre ce qu’il nous dit.Je trouve aussi qu’Apple devrait commencer à réfléchir à alléger l’iPhone tout en proposant un téléphone résistant et de qualité.En conclusion, je recommande cette iPhone, vous ne serez pas déçu, il est simple d’utilisation, agréable à utiliser au quotidien c’est du grand Apple comme d’habitude.

 Ich beziehe mich hier auf meine iPhone 13 Pro Max Bewertung (https://www.amazon.de/gp/customer-reviews/RJSH8YJZQ0YPD) bzw. allgemein ein Vergleich zum Vorgänger.Zum Vorgänger hat sich ""theoretisch"" etwas getan, aber merkt man davon etwas im Alltag!? Ich bin mit meinem 13 Pro Max sehr zufrieden gewesen, daher wird es das 14er schwer haben dieses noch zu ""überbieten"" und am Ende gibt es doch wieder eine ""Verschlechterung"" bei der Kamera.⚪ Gleich geblieben ⚪o Wunderschönes Design (natürlich wieder Geschmackssache), aber die Hochglanzränder sind weiterhin extreme Fingerabdruckmagnete, obwohl sie nun dunkler sindo Qualitativ sehr gut verarbeitet (Optik und Spaltmaße), aber sehr schwer im Gegensatz zur Konkurrenz und die Materialien erwecken einen sehr anfälligen Eindruck, so dass das Handy bei mir sofort in einer Hülle mit Panzerglas (beides von Spigen) gelandet ist - sehr schade, da man nun nichts vom schönen Design siehto Lightning auf USB-C Kabel dabei und immer noch kein USB-C am Geräto Display und Farbwiedergabe wieder mal sehr gut (kein Gelbstich oder ähnliches)o Der Bug, dass bei einer Displayhelligkeit von NULL schwarze Pixel nicht schwarz, sondern grau anzeigt wurden, ist zum Glück weiterhin behobeno Weiterhin sehr gute, wenn nicht sogar die besten, Lautsprecher (in dieser Größe) was Lautstärke und Qualität betrifft!o Das 13 Pro Max hatte eine sehr gute Akkulaufzeit und das 14 Pro Max ""kann"" hier auch mithalten. Warum kann? Je nach aktiviertem Feature, wie z.B. Always-On-Display, hält das 14 Pro Max dann verständlicherweise etwas kürzer durch. Aber wie immer muss man dem iPhone ein paar Tage geben bis es sich ""einpendelt"".✔️ Positives und Negatives zur Kamera ❌+ Allgemein ist die Kamera wieder etwas besser geworden. Warum etwas? Da sie sowieso schon auf einem sehr hohen Niveau ist. Jetzt, je nach Modus, mit 48 MP statt 12 MP. Merkt man die im Alltag? Nicht wirklich!+ Die Makrofunktion wurde nochmal etwas verbessert, ABER ...- ... aktiviert sich aber für meinen Geschmack manchmal schon zu früh+ Videos und Fotos in dunkler Umgebung sehen jetzt nochmal besser aus und ...+ ... der Portraitmodus ist in dunklen Lichtverhältnissen mit dem Tele‑Objektiv (3x und auch 2x) wieder besser geworden (war beim 13er schlechter als beim 12er und machte unscharfe Fotos, wenn von Hand geschossen wurde)-- Was gefühlt schlimmer geworden ist, ist die Objektivverzerrung. Gerade in Aufnahmen auf ""kurze"" Distanz (2-3m), also bei Gruppen oder Personenaufnahmen, verzerren Gesichter deutlich schneller.✔️ Positives und Negatives zum Display+ Dynamic Island statt der Notch. Ich mag die Veränderung und war für mich mit einer der Gründe umzusteigen. Was mir gefällt ist, dass man viele Funktionen mit einem Blick sieht (wie Timer, Musik, etc. pp.), ...- ... allerdings stört es in diversen Apps etwas mehr, da es nun noch weiter ins Bild ragt als die Notch (für mich überwiegt aber der Vorteil)+ nochmal heller als der Vorgänger, was die Benutzung in praller Sonne angenehmer macht+ ProMotion: sieht irgendwie nochmal flüssiger aus oder aktiviert sich schneller bzw. geschmeidiger als beim 13er+ Always-On-Display gefällt mir zwar sehr gut, aber habe ich aufgrund der Akkulaufzeit deaktiviert. Mir wäre eine Status LED (in diversen Farben je nach App) immer noch lieber* * * Fazit * * *Im Grunde hat sich nicht so viel getan zum 13er Pro Max, welches für mich weiterhin das Beste iPhone ist! Lohnt sich also ein Upgrade? Nein, dann würde ich das Geld lieber sparen und eventuell auf das 15er warten. Die einzigen Features die im Alltag auffallen und sinnvoll sein könnten ist die Dynamic Island und das Always-On-Display. Die Kamera macht keine deutlich besseren Fotos als der Vorgänger, so dass sich hier ein Upgrade lohnen würde. Mir viel hier sogar die Objektivverzerrung viel extremer bzw. negativer auf, als bei den anderen beiden Vorgängern. Man hat das Gefühl, dass das Kamerasystem mehr auf Landschaftsfotografie ausgelegt worden ist, als auf ""normale"" bzw. ""nahe"" Distanz.Wenn die Rezension hilfreich war, würde ich mich über ein ""Nützlich"" sehr freuen. 👍

Ich nutze ein iPhone seit dem ersten iPhone überhaupt, mit wenigen Ausnahmen hatte ich alle Modelle.Nebenher aber auch immer Android Geräte, aktuell das Galaxy S21 Ultra und Note 20 Ultra, sowie das Z-Fold 4. Dabei geht es mir fast immer nur um die Kamera. Voreingenommen, oder Markengebunden bin also ich keinesfalls.Nun zum aktuellen iPhone 14 Pro Max.Zuvor hatte bzw. habe ich immer noch, dass iPhone 12 Pro Max, das 13 Pro Max habe ich übersprungen.Das 12 Pro Max wandert nun in die Vitrine.Ich gehe nicht auf alle technischen Einzelheiten ein, denn die dürften bekannt sein.Was ich aber aus persönlicher Erfahrung konstatieren kann ist folgendes:Die Kamera ist der absolute Wahnsinn. Fotografie ist seit Jahrzehnten meine Leidenschaft, daher weiß ich, worauf ich achten muss. In noch keinem anderen Smartphone habe ich eine derart überragende Kamera erleben dürfen. Selbst einige meiner HighEnd Digitalkameras, wie Sony RX100 VII haben da massiver Schwierigkeiten mitzuhalten. Selbst meine Alpha 7 III macht nicht alles besser.Die Abbildungsleistung, die Detailtreue und der ausgewogene Nachtmodus beeindrucken mich tief. Die Makrofunktion ist ausgewogen und sorgt für viel Spaß. Der Pro RAW Modus ist genial gelöst, macht er die Qualität nochmals besser und erlaub es dem Fotografen alle Eingriffe professionell vorzunehmen.Damit kann man gestalten und im Nachhinein die Situation retten, wenn es einmal schnell gehen musste.Der Telebereich wurde leicht angehoben und erfüllt die meisten Ansprüche. Selbst höhere Zoombereiche sind machbar, auch wenn die dann digital aufbereitet werden, sind sie doch imponierend gut.Benötigt man mehr Tele, wie ich das oftmals brauche, muss man jedoch zu anderen Phones greifen. Daher nutze ich nebenher das Samsung S21 Ultra und sobald es vorgestellt wird, werde ich das S23 Ultra erwerben.Die Kamera des iPhone 14 Pro Max wurde in den letzten Tagen von vielen namhaften und anerkannt seriösen Profifotografen weltweit mit viel lob, regelrecht überhäuft. Zu Recht, wie ich es selbst erleben darf. Sie überzeugt auf allen Ebenen und das nachhaltig und beeindruckend.Der Akku begeistert nach wie vor. 2-3 Tage, bei meinem Nutzungsverhalten sind kein Problem.Das iPhone 14 Pro Max ist ansonsten ein Feinschliff auf allen Ebenen. Sei es die hervorragende Konsistenz des iOS in Bezug auf die Hardware. Oder die geniale Integration der Notch in die Dynamic Island. Eine Lösung, die elegant und intelligent zugleich ist.Genau das macht Apple aus. feinschliff, statt dieses Hecheln nach den Superlativen. Immer ruhig, aber stringent alles verbessern, unaufgeregt.Natürlich das iPhone schwer, natürlich ist die Kamera groß. Wie soll das auch anders sein, wenn man diese Leistung fordert und dann schlussendlich auch bekommt. Wer das nicht möchte, der muss sich ein kleineres Modell kaufen. Wer seine Präferenzen woanders sieht, für den gibt es genug Auswahl.Doch mit einem iPhone, wie dem 14 Pro Max, bekommt man das derzeit beste Gesamtpaket aus Software, Hardware und Leistungsfähigkeit. Ein Gerät das 5-7 Jahre mit Updates unterstützt wird, jedes Jahr, zeitgleich, weltweit.Kritisieren könnte man den immer noch vorhandenen Lightning Anschluss, doch das wäre Jammern auf hohem Niveau.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  Ich bin jedenfalls rundherum zufrieden und kann hier eine glasklare Kaufempfehlung und aussprechen und 5 Sterne vergeben.

Upgrading from IPhone 13 Pro Max , the differences are few, considering the dynamic island to be the biggest one.  Overall the quality of the phone is top notch , as usually. There is also an improvement at the cameras , which is even better.In conclusion, if you are already at the Apple ecosystem this device will not disappoints you.As if it's worth upgrading from 13 Pro Max , this is something that I cannot say it for sure  , depends on how often you are used to change devices.

Alors déja je tien à souligner sois la chance, sois l’effort d’Amazon d’avoir fais l’effort que je le reçois avant Noël ( date initiale 9 Janvier) donc malgré tout ils ont assurés. Ensuite concernant l’iphone pour ma part je passe d’un Iphone 12 pro max a un iphone 14 pro max, j’ai tout de suite remarqué l’écran. La rapidité et la force du GPU cet iphone est magnifique. L’a couleur Violet intense parcontre est belle mais a mon gout tire un peu vers le noir faut bien regarder pour voir la différence un peu déçue par rapport a cela car au final j’aurais pu l’avoir plutôt encore car je voulais absolument la couleur violet intense, sinon RAS tout est niquel.

Dieses Modell ist viel erfolgreicher als das vorherige, da das iPhone 13 Pro Max die Kamera nicht gut fokussieren konnte.  Ich möchte erwähnen, dass der Preis etwas hoch ist, da die Änderungen des neuen Modells nicht groß sind

Das beste iPhone was ich bisher mein Eigen nennen durfte. Die Ergebnisse der Kamera sind nahezu auf Profi Niveau, das 120Hz OLED Display macht einfach Spaß. Der Sprung vom 11er aufs 14er war sehr lohnenswert. Auch die Dynamic Island ist eine tolle Neuerung und jedes mal aufs Neue ein Hingucker. Einzig der Preis ist Apple typisch völlig überzogen, aber mir ist es das Wert. Empfehlung meinerseits!

zu meinem iPhone 12 Pro Max. Die Specs brauche ich nicht anzuführen die gibt es bei Apple umfassend. Zum Telefon, ich habe den Eindruck das Display ist heller schärfer und reagiert schneller. Die Verbindungen sind stabil und gut, Air sowie Wifi. Da ich nur eine Hand, die linke habe ist es für mich wichtig das iPhone einhändig bedienen zu können, und meine Hand ist keine ""Bratpfanne"", dies funkioniert wegen der schnellen und genauen Funktion des Displays sehr gut Nun aber zum Zuckerstück des iPone 14 Pro Max die Kamera. Da muss ich sagen, sehr gut, die farbtreue, die tiefenschärfe, ein gut und schnell laufender Zoom ein guter HDR Modus. Mit dem entsprechenden Bildbearbeitungsprogramm lassen sich mit den Bilder hervorragende Bilder erzeugen. Fazit, ich bin zufrieden und mehr will ich nicht.

Wer ein IPhone 13 Pro hat, für den rechnet sich das Upgrade nicht. Bei der 128GB Variante ist der ProRes Modus nur für 1080P / 30 fps freigeschaltet, also wer mit 4K mit ProRes filmen möchte muss noch tiefer in die Tasche greifen und eine Variante mit mehr Speicher kaufen. Ansonsten macht das Handy aber echt Spaß, besonders die „Dynamic Island“ gefällt mir. Es ist einfach mal was neues fürs Auge und eine kleine Spielerei. Der Akku ist wirklich ein Monster und hält zumindest bei mir locker 2 Tage trotz relativ intensiver Benutzung. Insgesamt macht das Handy einen sehr Qualitativ hochwertigen Eindruck, liegt schön in der Hand und die Performance ist auch beeindruckend.

Switched from Samsung S21 Plus, and I went into it not expecting to like it that much, I just heard social media apps are better optimized for IOS and since I need them for my work I decided to go for it.I was pleasantly surprised! Apps really do work so much better, and the user experience is more smooth overall. The only complaint I have is that the numbers aren’t on the main keyboard and I want the option to add them there, and it feels a little bit slow in comparison to Samsung, as if all the animations are weighing the phone down.Other than that, I’m loving the change!

Ich hatte bisher ein iPhone 11 Pro benutzt und wollte unbedingt auf Max umsteigen. Daher habe ich mir das iPhone 14 Pro Max zugelegt. Das iPhone 14 Pro Max hat mich bis jetzt positiv beeindruckt.Der Unterschied zu meinem alten iPhone ist enorm. Das iPhone 14 Pro Max ist flüssiger, leistungsstarker und und schneller. Über die Kamera muss ich echt nicht viel schreiben. Sie ist faszinierend. Die Bildauflösung ist sehr hoch. Dadurch steigt auch die Qualität der Fotos, die man macht. Die Farbe Dunkellila hat mich begeistert. Sie lässt das iPhone edel wirken und ist zudem eine ziemlich extravagante Farbe. Im Großen und Ganzen kann ich berichten, dass ich mit den iPhone sehr zufrieden bin. Einen Stern ziehe ich wegen dem hohen Preis ab und dass es zu dem Preis keinen Adapter zum Laden dazu gibt.

I upgraded to the iPhone 14 Pro Max from an iPhone XS.So far the battery life is exactly what apple has promised. I am a rather light user. I typically browse the news when I’m traveling to work, perhaps listen to some music for my hour long commute. Same commute back home. And I still have more than 50% battery life!Such a huge improvement from my iPhone XS which could hardly make it through to evening.I like that the camera has now a wide angle lens, a 3 times zoom telephoto lens and something called cinematic mode which I still have to try out.All in all, I am very much impressed and happy that I bought this phone.

Ich benutze seit 2013 hauptsächlich iPhones, mit 2 Android Handys, die als Zweitgerät benutzt wurden/werden. Mein Handy davor war ein 12 Pro Max welches ich geliebt habe. Wie immer fing mein 12PM an zu spinnen, sobald neuere Modelle erschienen. Das war zur Zeit der 13er Serie so (bei der waren die Neuigkeiten nicht einen Wechsel Wert), dasselbe passierte auch mit der 14er Serie, bei der musste aber nun ein neues Handy her.Ja die Dynamic Island sieht toll aus und wird, sobald sich mehrere Apps angepasst haben, sogar etwas besseres; Ja der Kinomodus ist toll, man kann aus allem ein Meisterstück kreieren; Und ja, das Akku hält etwas besser als mein 12PM (mit nur 82% Akkukapazität), aber hier hört es auch schon auf.Wenn ich die Möglichkeit hätte, würde ich das Gerät zurücksenden, ich bin kurz davor direkt zu Apple zu rennen aber gedulde mich noch.Die Kamera war (und teilweise ist immer noch) eine Katastrophe.Zu Beginn dauerte es bis zu 11 Sekunden, bis die Kamera reagierte (also konnte man spontane Fotoaufnahmen vergessen), da meine Geduld zu dem Zeitpunkt schon am Ende war, weiß ich nicht wie lange es tatsächlich maximal bräuchte. Also musste ich stets die Kamera App aus dem Hintergrund entfernen (schließen) und neustarten. Es passierte also nicht nur in den Apps von Drittanbietern.Normale Videos sind furchtbar, man sieht den Übergang zum Makromodus, da kann ich mittlerweile fast keine Videos mehr aufnehmen, ohne Brüche in der Aufnahme festzustellen. Da ich Produktaufnahmen, Social Media Content und weiteres aufnehme, ist dies für mich ein No-No-No!Viele Apps stürzen auch nach mehreren Updates ab, sollte sich zwar bald beruhigen sobald es wieder ein Update gibt oder die App Hersteller an der Kompatibilität geschraubt haben, nervt aber trotzdem.Ich weiß, dass viele von diesen (und dutzenden weiteren) Problemen durch diverse Updates beseitigt werden (können) aber ehrlich gesagt finde ich die Preise in Deutschland eh eine Frechheit, dann auch noch ein Gerät zu erhalten, welches noch nicht ausgereift ist, finde ich absurd.Ich habe das 512GB Modell nur ausgewählt weil es das einzige schnell lieferbare war, musste also nochmal tiefer in die Geldtasche greifen aber bin sehr enttäuscht. Mein nächstes Handy wird kein iPhone sein, das steht schon mal fest.

Sehr zufrieden!Mega schnelle Leistung. Always-on-display ist für mich sehr von Vorteil (obwohl der Akku vielleicht deswegen ein bisschen leidet), da ich nicht immer den Bildschirm anfassen muss, um zu sehen was für eine Mitteilung ich bekommen habe, oder wie spät es ist. Face-ID im Landscape-Modus. Tolle Kameras (besonders mit 48 MP in RAW Format). Heller Bildschirm für draußen in der Sonne. Sehr gute Lautsprecher und sogar ist die ""Dynamic Island"" besser und schöner als gedacht.

 The first time I used an iPhone … I found it a wonderful device, excellent features that suit me very much, but I have a small remark. I hope Apple will listen to me. My problem is I wish them to make a phone with a stylus, as Samsung does, because this helps me a lot in my work.  Thank you and I wish you further progress

Ich ersetze mit dem iPhone 14 Pro Max mein mittlerweile vier Jahre altes Xs Max, da ich nicht zu den Menschen gehöre, die jedes Jahr das neueste Modell besitzen müssen. Und das Upgrade ist in dem Fall schon deutlich. Es ist extrem schnell, das Display ist äußerst hell und scharf und die Kamera macht wirklich brillante Bilder. Zudem bin ich mit 5G nun auch auf dem aktuellen Stand. Always-On benötige und nutze ich nicht. Was mir nicht so gefällt ist der Kamerabuckel, welcher beim Xs Max deutlich dezenter ausfällt. Auch der Preis ist mittlerweile recht schmerzhaft. Wenn es sich aber genau so wacker schlägt wie mein Xs Max, dann kann man das wohl noch verkraften. Amazon und DPD haben übrigens verlässlich und pünktlich geliefert.

I like the build quality of Apple products, and the iPhone 14 Plus makes no exception. The cameras are amazing, especially if you use them with a third party app. It is not much more to say about this phone, it does what it should do and it is very reliable. The only minus point is that in 2022 we still have the old lighting port instead of the much faster usb c.

Die technischen Sprünge zwischen den iPhone-Generationen sind nicht mehr so groß wie in früheren Jahren, jedoch kommen gleichwohl jedes Jahr neue sinnvolle Verbesserungen hinzu.USB-C wäre sicherlich auch schon für das 14er wünschenswert gewesen, aber das ist sicherlich klagen auf hohem Niveau.Kritiker die einen Mangel an Neuerungen ausgemacht haben, müssen die aktuelle Generation ja nicht kaufen. Für alle anderen ist es ein super Smartphone, welches einen gut durch den Tag bringt und tolle Fotos schießt.

Ceux qui mettre moins de 5 étoiles franchement c’est honteux car toujours rien a dire sur les produits Apple ils sont top.Forcément si on prends un iPhone 13 et ensuite le 14 on vois pas de grande différence. Mais quand vous prenez un 11 pro et vous passez à un 14 pro ba wouaou ! C’est fluide, photos magnifiques ! D’ailleurs les objectifs c’est du big objectif 🤣 parfait ! Du apple quoi….

Zum Vergleich habe ich mein iPhone 11 Pro Max.Schnelligkeit, Qualität der Fotos, die neue Dynamic Island und die neuen Lautsprecher sind toll geworden. Bisher gibts nichts zu meckern, dass sollte es auch meiner Meinung nicht, bei einem HANDY!! für knapp 1.600€.War sicherlich nicht mein letztes iPhone!

Habe seit dem iphone 3GS iphones und mein letzter Wechsel war nun vom 11 pro zum 14 pro max. Grundsätzlich wie üblich ein gutes Gerät. Nur die Neuerungen auch bei einem größeren Sprung (11 pro auf 14 pro max) sind zu vernachlässigen. Es gibt eigentlich in meinen Augen nur noch wenige Features die für ein ""Must-have"" taugen. Das Hauptaugenmerk auf die Kamera finde ich auch nicht so toll (vielleicht für Spezialisten unabdingbar) - auch mein 11 pro hat schon super Fotos gemacht. Dynamic Island - nett, aber auch nicht mehr. Satelliten-Notruf - steht im wahrsten Sinn des Wortes in den Sternen, wann dieses Feature für Europa aktiviert wird. Hauptsächliche Gründe für den Wechsel bei mir waren: besseres Display (ja das ist durchaus merklich) und die bessere Akkulaufzeit. Der Wow-Effekt ist aber bei diesem Wechsel ausgeblieben.

I found the overheating issue while charging and it's not tolerable. Also when in camera mode, it gets quickly warms and when I transfer the video to Adobe premiere pro, the contrast gets demolished. For this overheating issue, I sent it back. Other all is okay. The phone is perfect. The look is great. The Camera is great. I don't understand why the price is higher on amazon than apple website. It should be less.

Hab jetzt immer ein Jahr ausgesetzt und zuvor das iPhone 12 Pro Max gehabt jetzt das iPhone 14 Pro Max, werde es zurück schicken. Keins der ,,neuen,, Merkmale rechtfertigt den Preis und ich bin wirklich ein Apple jünger. Also gehts zurück, wenn ihr nen 13 pro habt mach das Upgrade noch weniger Sinn. Leider ist der Wert Verfall durch die Marktsättigung inzwischen auch zu spüren. Also lieber iPhone 13 Pro und warten oder in den saueren Apfel beißen.

Beim Transfer der Daten stürzte das Teil ab und der Bildschirm blieb schwarz. Reset. Nochmal.Endlich läuft es.Die Farben des Bildschirms sind übersättigt, soll wohl dadurch ""hochwertiger"" wirken. Die Kamerasensoren auf der Rückseite sind riesengroß, wie bei einem Chinahandy.Apropos China:Bei der Bedienung kommt plötzlich nervige Werbung. Apple braucht mehr Geld: Für ""Apple Arcade"" und irgendwelchen anderen Konsumkram. Alles im Abo natürlich.Apps gibts nur im Store. Manuelle Installation? Fehlanzeige.Netzteil? Muss man extra kaufen. Klimaschutz. Na klar. Als ob das bei nem 1500 Euro Smartphone noch ne Rolle spielen würde.Keine Ahnung wie man als Marktführer mit so nem lausigen Produkt kommen kann.

Overall a very good phone, and serves its purpose- finally replaced my old iPhone 7.  It needs a bit of getting used to slid to the next screen.Saved £££ during Prime Day.  Items arrived opened box and without a manual- but received an extra discount.  Very pleased with the extra saving!

I had one of these a while ago but it was the first that Apple brought out. When I got a new Apple I passed it onto the wife and she thought it was great, years pass and the phone packs up ( the battery) so I bought her the iPhone 12 upgraded version it’s taken a while to get her bearings on it but she getting there!

So the phone works amazing had it for a good few months now and has done me wonders but the only problem is the battery seems to not last as long as it should do I don’t know if it got damaged on the way or that’s me just having to much of expectations but other than that I would recommend having this phone

My last iPhone was the 1st Gen iPhone SE in 2016, it was great however it had a small 32GB storage, I got rid of it because I kept running out of space and iCloud drive wasn't great at the time, hence I got the 256GB capacity iPhone 12Been on Android for 5 years and it's been a welcome return back to iPhone, the phone is smooth, animations are immediate, FaceID has never let me down, with Apple's 20W charger, the charge time is pretty good too. iPhone 12 has wireless charging which makes it perfect to charge conveniently in the car.Battery life is okay, nothing to write home about, I'm a power user and I can get 6 hours of screen on time day to day, and very rarely have I killed it in one day.Design wise, if you loved the iPhone 4, you'll love this, it's an extension of that design idea, not slippery to hold like previous iPhones, this is Apple at it's best when it comes to industrial design.Highly recommend the iPhone 12, I think it's the pick of the bunch since the Pro models have the same A14 processor and unless you really want LiDAR and the extra macro camera, I think this is the pick of the bunch.

Ordered to replace my iPhone 11. Phone has a great camera, facial recognition, easy to use, clear screen quality etc… but the battery does not last long at all. I feel I am constantly having to charge it up where I could have the same usage with my iPhone 11 and the battery would last all day.

This was a replacement for my ageing iPhone 7plus and it was worth the wait. I got this before the iPhone 13 was release at a very good price, its screen, battery life and speed are all excellent and with the longevity of the apple devices and the support for several years of updates I had no hesitation to buy another over the android devices that have very poor support for anything more than one year. I have been delighted with the ease of migrating data from one phone to the next which used wireless pairing and seamless migration of everything from my old phone to the new one. The camera is also excellent and its a nice device to hold too. Shame I have to put it in a case for work due to the hostile environments I work in. Otherwise I would recommend this to those looking for an upgrade from an older device at a more affordable price
"
6407,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Had to send my XR back bad connection problems but usual excellent customer service from Amazon so decided to upgrade to a 12 not a lot of cosmetic difference between them nothing seem to change much on the working aspect of the phones keep giving fancy write ups re the camera but sadly a picture is a picture to me I don’t see the difference between any photos never really grasp the extortionate prices for I phones one is much like the other if you compare them on apples compare I phones there is very little difference in the phone apart from the price legalised extortion by apple really had all different models of iPhones since their conception only had trouble with the XR but the warranty covered that so see how this one goes
"
6408,B08L5P5B68,5,"
The only thing I was pleasantly surprised about after a few days usage is the battery life, which I expected to be worse after reading other reviews. I'm coming from an iPhone 7 Plus that I used for 4 years, so I was expecting to notice the upgrade. I easily manage to get 30-40% charge at the end of the day with normal use (about 1h in voice calls, 15 minutes videocall, occasional YouTube videos, texting and 3-4 pictures throughout the day).I'm not using the camera for pictures and videos much, as I prefer using my Fujifilm mirrorless for photography.I love the blue color, but I am biased as it is my favorite. I was tempted by the black one, which I believe is going to be the most picked one. Face ID works like a charm. It's unfortunate we are in a pandemic and wear masks when shopping, so Face ID won't work for contactless payments. It does quickly switch to passcode though, so you can avoid removing your face covering, as you are not supposed to. I have tried recommended methods to make it work with a face covering, but it did not work for me.

The iPhone 12 is a brilliant phone. I originally had an iPhone 8 and upgraded to the 12. The camera is brilliant - the pictures come out so crisp and look amazing. I like the more rounder edges of this iPhone as well. I got the iPhone 12 in blue and it looks so great, the picture of it doesn’t do it justice! The only downside of this is that due to the price I’d have hoped to have got headphones and I thankfully already had a mains plug but if someone else was buying an apple product for the first time then you will need to buy one or you aren’t able to charge your phone. The size is of this phone is great too, I’m so glad I didn’t go for the bigger size because this can fit into your pocket perfectly. I love that this has face recognition (what did I do before this?!) it’s so much easier to use now even though with having to use masks all the time right now it isn’t difficult for that but worth it if you aren’t needing to use Apple Pay!
"
6410,B08L5P5B68,5,"
I purchased the iPhone 12 to replace my iPhone SE on which the battery was failing and needed recharging more than once a day. As soon as I received the new phone (the day after I ordered it, excellent service) I transferred the contents to the new phone without having to get assistance, so other than being a bit bigger it is as easy to use as the last phone. The keyboard is bigger so easier for me to type. Face recognition, the first time I have used it is brilliant but I fear I may forget my passwords as it is easier to use. All in all it is a great phone I haven’t used the camera yet, but I’m pretty sure it will be better than my old phone. Now charging once every two days, for now. I can only say that I love iPhones and think they are worth the extra money.👍

The last time I bought a new iPhone was in 2011, since then I’ve always bought 2nd hand because of the cost, but this time Amazon let me get the phone on monthly payments.I went for the iPhone 12 256GB and WOW, I was impressed the 1st night I had it. I’m a photo taker and this phone just amazes me with the quality of the camera alone. All the photos were taken at night with NO flash and they look amazing.Siri listens for the 1st time ever!It’s soooooo loud compared to my old 7s Plus, it’s almost like I have a soundbar in my pocket!I love the colour, I went for the Green one, well it is different!It’s seriously fast too, once I ordered a 5G sim from my provider that is!I have zero complaints about the phone, worth the money as I know it will last!

Expensive for what it is, but then all the newest phones are.It is a nice phone though and I feel if you’ve had multiple iphones in the past, you know what it’s all about. It’ll take some adjusting to without having a home button at the bottom and a few additional button combinations and swipe patterns to get used.The camera’s are a noticeable improvement, and I do like the face id to unlock - and when I’m wearing a face mask it will still unlock if it detects I’m wearing my apple watch so it knows it’s me.The bigger screen is nice and I’m hoping the battery lasts longer with it being bigger but I have to say I do like having a phone you can operate with 1 hand and this does require 2 to reach all extremities of the screen.

I like it. No problem with it just like it’s says in description. Brand new. No damages. Working perfectly.
"

It's fairly responsive in touch and speed with opening appsThe camera doesn't feel that much improved but it's still very goodI'd say the best thing about the phone is the better CPU allow smooth operation and of course a better battery lifeI've given 4 stars due to the fact that Apple take the  liberty of removing earphones, chargers or adapters. I sincerely hope other companies don't follow suit.It's crazy enough paying almost 1k for phones nowadays and to receive nothing else additional feels like robbery

I bought this iPhone two days ago and it arrived today. I confess I was so afraid of being robbed on the way from UK to Dublin. Well, thank Gosh it didn't happen. I got it, recharged, put my acc on it, all my apps, SIM card and everything is absolutely fantastic. I don't think I need to write about the performance of the phone (because it's awesome) but I am sure to recommend if you are looking for a phone here in Amazon, check the sellers and the reviews and pray :DThank you

Phone arrived on time, the currier arrived to the door and we both was scared on the trade of parcel for password and at the end we made safe; nothing wrong with the currier, the shipping was excellent. I turned on the phone and the system started with aggressive configurations and queries for phone identifier, I text a software engineer in the group to restore IMEI and component serial, technically the amazon control team was using a foreign country identification for myself name, and I am attending the reset to first start of the phone to obtain primary original IOS addons and amazon shopping reference in UK.

6425,B08L5P5B68,5,"
This is definitely my favourite iphone I have had so far, the design is great and feels really nice to hold and feels really smooth to use with its fast speeds, the camera takes really nice clear pictures and the video quality is great, also the sound from the speakers is great and loud which is good when watching videos and listing to music on, the screen size is also perfect for me as not to big and not to small, nice to watch YouTube and other videos on and also good for gaming as games also run nice and smooth. This is the perfect mobile phone for me as does everything i want and just the right size. Highly recommend this iphone as very happy with it.

Apple rarely disappoint because they follow a formula that works. If you have used iPhone in the last 5 years. You come to expect what iPhone’s are capable with. This iPhone was purchased as an upgrade from an iPhone 8 Plus for my mum and it is an healthy upgrade. If you have an 11 or XR maybe wait till 14 because by that point their should be a noticeable upgrade.
"
6428,B08L5P5B68,5,"
We always save up and purchase our phones out right and then get a monthly sim only deal as you save a fortune over a 2/3 year contract. This iPhone isn’t all bells and whistles - not a huge difference from our previous iPhone 7 Plus - however the camera is significantly better and the battery life lasts a whole day without charging and the face recognition is quick and easy - even wearing glasses or a mask! . Having said that, I probably don’t use all the features on it - so may be missing out on some major upgrades - but for my needs it’s perfect.We are an Apple family and love them and if that’s the case, would recommend this phone.
"
6429,B08L5P5B68,4,"
Very good Smartphone - like ever - but one important thing is missing: FingerPrint reader. Nowadays where we are constantly using masks, just face recognition is not enough. It should have kept the fingerprint reader - in the same way I have in my old iPhone 8.I have a Xiaomi that costs 30% - and IT contains both, face and fingerprint options. This is a very expensive product, should bring everything - including the charger... come on!

Used Android phones for years, pretty much every pixel phone, and quite a few samsungs, thought it was time to try an iphone.Love it, nice design, quality, great camera and battery life.Everything about it feels premium.
"
6431,B08L5P5B68,3,"
Pros:It gives premium feel and rich experience, which is obvious.Camera is really good which iPhone is known for.Cons:Sometime it hangs all of a sudden. The app icons doesn't work at all. And I must restart the phone to make it work again. It may be one device issue but it shouldn't be even for one device given the price.While talking on WhatsApp call, my voice won't go through if the other person is talking.
"
6432,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Switching from Android to an iPhone for the 1st time was an adjustment but the phone is really easy to use, camera is great, battery life very good.All in all very pleased with the iphone 12

I bought this as an upgrade from iPhone 8. Love the face recognition , easy to set up from my old phone.Camera is better. And bigger screen.
"
6434,B08L5P5B68,4,"
I moved to iphone from samsung just for camera quality. however if you are looking for best pictures, u still need to go for pro or even pro max. Before buying, i watched quite alot of youtube videos which compare the cameras and donot really find a big difference. In real life, when you put both iphone 12 and pro cameras together, it makes a difference in my personal view. Especially when it is dark, or complete opposite too bright ! So if you are buying mainly for camera and paying this money, just try yo go for pro if you can, if not, it is a great phone, great battery life, super fast... best iphone generation...

Absolute disappointment. Never had so many issues with network connection on any devices I owned. Week mobile  reception, Wi-Fi is the worst won't connect or stay connected. Total garbage. Will sell it and never look on iphone again. Even Friking Poco F3 does better job for less than half price.

My old iPhone 7 broke. Bought this iPhone 12 to replace it. The colour blue is okay as expected. The bigger screen is what i wanted. Other functions are all similar to my iPhone 7, so i had no problem using it. It takes better pictures, comfortable to hold, battery life is okay so far as i turned icloud back-up off so the battery life lasts longer. I am quite happy with it.

6441,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Would take a photo but can’t because I’m using the phone because it’s so good! It’s apple so you should expect it to be good. Came well packed and I damaged. Came on the day it said and was perfect.

I’ve been needing to get a new phone for months and originally I was going to get an iPhone 11 but after the 11 being out of stock EVERYWHERE, I decided to buy the 12 since Amazon offered a pay-monthly scheme for it. The payments are £145.80 spread over 5 months which is really good and overall works out cheaper for me.The colour is gorgeous, the camera is excellent and overall it’s a very good phone. Really pleased :)

Great phone, a lot of money but they usually last long. The finishing on the back (shiny on the standard 12) is a bit annoying as it gets full of fingertips, the lack of headphones and charging brick is a joke for the money you spend.The building quality is amazing, the software is brilliant and the transition from another iPhone is amazing.
"
6449,B08L5P5B68,5,"
I bought this for my son and I don't know the first thing about technology but I know that he wanted a iPhone so I read the reviews and decided to buy it for him off Amazon, I checked around to make sure I was paying the right price and I do trust Amazon so my thinking was if it's not what he wants I can return it and get a full refund. He loves it and says it's much better than the phone he had which isn't a iPhone but a good one nethertheless. He went for a walk and sent me the above picture on his new iphone it was getting dark and the quality is exceptional compared to his old phone. He said it's brilliant and would highly recommend it.
"
6450,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Just bought this iPhone 12 in purple beautiful phone really great price on Amazon thank you! Very easy to set up and install from your old iPhone there is definitely a difference between the iPhone 11 and this iPhone 12 well worth buying this is  my favourite iPhone and I’ve  ever owned and I’ve had iPhones  since iPhone 4 very good experience buying from Amazon as i was able to pay monthly interest free instead of outright like I’ve done previously with apple just noticed it’s 20 % off today so even more reason to buy this stunning iPhone  from apple via Amazon as far cheaper than apple store

Great phone and easy to use.

Really nice phone to be honest. Always been an android user. Slowly been moving over to apple devices elsewhere and decided for this upgrade to switch. The eco system is fantastic and the iPhone 12 just completes it. The battery life is phenomenal, I’m not glued to my phone so obviously your mileage will vary. But it always last the day and will charge to 80% to preserve the life of the battery. As I don’t require a full charge each day. Really snappy and hasn’t let me down once yet on the 3 months I’ve had it.

All my Busines and family activity.I should not  have bought it. Facial recognition good. Battery life awful. Should gone for iPhone 13.
"
6454,B08L5P5B68,5,"
I changed from an 11 Pro Max to the 12 because I like to keep up to date, even though to be honest it doesn't feel any faster because it shares the same gig mem. But I was a little tired of the weight and size of the 11 Pro Max and enjoy the smaller form factor of the 12. Though I must say I didn't see the phone in person (in an Apple store) before I purchased online, and I wouldn't call it red, more like a dark salmon in colour. If I had seen it in person first, I would have gone for another colour. But then again, after the case is on, all I see is the camera cut out.

I’ve had an iPhone 6s for some years and decided to upgrade to an iPhone 12. I thought I’d notice a difference but apart from having lots of storage I’m disappointed with my new phone, nothing seems any different with it, for example battery life is still poor, downloading speed still quite slow etc, not sure it was worth the money
"
6456,B08L5P5B68,5,"
I decided to buy a new phone as opposed to a secondhand phone, although it’s very expensive it’s what I have been using for years! Still working out how everything works!
"
6457,B08L5P5B68,5,"
This iPhone 12 have been amazing the battery life would last even the whole day I love it only thing I dislike is that we weren’t given a proper charger
"
6458,B08L5P5B68,5,"
iPhone 12, is a phone worth purchasing. I found it abit challenging at first not being able to find my way around the interface, however, now I have adjusted, thumbs up.Face recognition is new to me and I now find it very useful when not wearing a mask 😂. Battery life is excellent.I also like the feature were I can set it on 4G/5G.
"
6459,B08L5P5B68,5,"
The iPhone 12 is superb it is the perfect middle of the road phone. Its updated to latest specs and software does what ever is needed.Its an excellent phone its screen is the perfect size, especially now that I just upgraded from iPhone 7. so its a world of a difference. the only issues are the price it is overpriced and the faceID which I feel is a step down from the more secure touchID and too much of a gimmick.The battery is outstanding it literally lasts all day - 2 days without recharge especially if you’re a light user!A superb all around phone.
"
6460,B08L5P5B68,5,"
The phone is as expected.However just pray you don’t have any issues.I had issues and Amazon and Amazon’s customer service is simply shocking.You pay over £800 for a phone and have a problem within 24 hours, I expect a replacing phone not a repair!!I ended up going to the apple store in birmingham who sorted the phone.I’ll never buy an item like this from Amazon again
"
6461,B08L5P5B68,5,"
I have been an android user since I switched from my iPhone 4 back in 2011. This design really takes me back and I’ve got to admit Apple have done a superb job here.I’ve recently used the pixel 2xl and the pixel 3a and considering google have done a really good job with their own stripped back software, for me it’s nowhere near to Apple.The iPhone 12 feels and looks premium and the iOS is a game changer compared to Android.Personally I prefer to purchase my phones out right than sign up to a 24 month contract. Depending on what sim deal you can find you could save around £400 to £600 over 2 years so it’s always worth checking.Overall it’s a great iPhone and looks fantastic in blue.!
"
6462,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Nothing new
"
6463,B08L5P5B68,5,"
This is a perfect phone. Perfect size ,weight, smooth and elegant design. Impressive battery life for an above average user. I recommend a 256 GB. The only area I am very slightly disappointed is the screen response and touch ( typing) not bad though. I felt the phone is slightly overpriced from that perspective. I also recommend  a green one . And also,I think i phone 12 is the perfect one unless you are OK with very heavy and big phones. I felt like the money I spent on this phone is not useless.  Go ahead and get it. You will not be disappointed.
"
6464,B08L5P5B68,4,"
Small improvement but does feel better to hold, the camera is miles ahead of the X too. Upgraded due to iphone X age had decreased perfomance, maybe hold out for next release if you are with an iphone x still
"
6465,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Having upgraded from an iPhone7 I’m absolutely loving the 12.  Have got used to facial recognition & swiping very quickly.  As always, transferring phone info over was very quick & simple.  I’ve watched a couple of YouTube videos to understand the extra/different functionality which has really helped.  Battery life is definitely much better than my 7.  All in all I’m very happy with the 12.
"
6466,B08L5P5B68,3,"
Well its an ihpone yes. We know they hooked us on and now we are tied to the ever more expensive models. We know that Apple earns a  ... load of money with them.But to deliver the phone without any head phones at all now is mean. Its only topped by the fact that it is delivered without an operational charger either. A new cable type which would not fit into any old charger.  So please spend how much extra?Its like selling a car without tyresIt is disgraceful,  it should be illegal.
"
6467,B08L5P5B68,5,"
I fell in love with the phone. But, my service provider couldn't facilitate eSIM. And it's very difficult to change eSIM for any emergency needs or we travel to other places and wants to use new SIM.Apple should have provided Dual Nano SIM's. eSIM's will be difficult process for everyone to get and configure it. I'm sure not even 0.5% of iPhone users are adaptive to eSIM.
"
6468,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Another year, another new iPhone and this time it is really a different from all iPhones before not only because supports 5G or of the new square design, but everything it’s new inside and out and looks and feels promising. Delivery from Amazon top notch only took 2 days. The phone itself works great, connectivity is much better than previous models and battery life is just as before, screen is crisp and colours are great, camera performance is excellent for day and night photos, stereo speakers are definitely the best of all phones I ever used,  they simply deliver immersive sound that matches cinema experience. All in all Best iPhone to date. Negative: well the price is on the higher end but we all know that.
"
6469,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Apple just keep making it easier to upgrade between their phones! The whole setup was effortless and face recognition is working well.This is the first time I’ve had an iPhone with no home button, but it’s very self explanatory and easy to use.
"
6470,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Upgraded from an iPhone 7 Plus and its so so much better. Crystal clear screen. Better cameras front and back. Face recognition is fantastic, So far battery life is excellent only having to charge at night and even then its maybe down to 40% after using a lot during the day. Wireless charging makes life easy once you have the charge pads/stands. Thought id miss the home button but No its an excellent phone.
"
6471,B08L5P5B68,5,"
the last iphone i had was the iPhone 5SE.  I then decided to switch to android. I had two Android smartphones over the last few years, one midrange and one top range but i was increasingly feeling dissatisfied with the Android experience.i decided to upgrade to the latest iPhone and that decision has proved to be the right one.  i am very satisfied with the iPhone 12.  It is superb and thoroughly deserves to be called a smartphone.  I couldn't be more pleased with it.
"
6472,B08L5P5B68,3,"
It is so pretty! the iphone 12’s design is so pretty in my personal opinion, it has amazing compatability with a lot of apps, the battery life seems good so far, i hope it stays like thatUpdate: Battery life has gone down so badly over the past year of having it, face ID has broken within 4-6 months of having the phone too 😐 Apple has gone downhill IMO, I've upgraded since
"
6473,B08L5P5B68,5,"
had a old phone that was small so this one is much better because it has a bigger screen.i like apple phones so bought this one.
"
6474,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Everything good iPhones are a great bit of kit.
"
6475,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Is really comfortable when you hold it in your hand.in your pocket too. It has quite good camera. The battery is not that bad. I charge it once a day and is enough for me. I listen to a lot of music during the day.  This shows that it can handle daily tasks really easily.
"
6476,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Have been a Apple iPhone user for the last 10 years using a iPhone 6 which has never let me down, this upgrade to the 12 was a big step for me but after 3 weeks of using the new phone I am glad I purchased this phone it is fabulous and easy to use I would certainly recommend the iPhone 12.
"
6477,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Excellent, I bought this for my mom for mother's day and she is very happy with the product!
"
6478,B08L5P5B68,5,"
It’s the first time to buy an Apple mobile phone on Amazon. I personally feel quite nervous, because I don’t know if it is really necessary to buy it on Amazon or go to the Apple store.  Start with the mobile phone, everything is normal, the quality is guaranteed and it is worth buying.
"
6479,B08L5P5B68,5,"
I bought this for my wife to replace her 6S and she absolutely loves it.The camera is superb and so is the quality when watching videos on YouTube.It is a solid phone with superb features.The lack of a charger I feel is irrelevant as you can use your old chargers anyway and the battery life is a massive improvement.The lack of a headphone jack is also irrelevant to me as I bought an excellent adapter which works perfectly with wired headphones.
"
6480,B08L5P5B68,5,"
I’d written off the idea of getting an iPhone after being disappointed with the iPhone 6 I had in the past but, after advice from family I ordered this and it’s perfect 👍
"
6481,B08L5P5B68,3,"
The phone is great everything works fine just display is worse than on my iPhone 6s. A little yellowish. I was thinking to return it back but after I watched many videos on YouTube I decided to keep it as many people has similar problem. First time disappointed by Apple quality. Apple saying there’s nothing wrong with display it’s tuned by factory to yellowish tint and it’s still within specifications
"
6482,B08L5P5B68,5,"
The only thing against this phone is my face's ability to either mute the sound or facetime someone mid-call.Apart from that battery life is excellent, face recognition is a real plus, and everything else works as well as you would expect an Apple product to.
"
6483,B08L5P5B68,5,"
I’ve always been an android user however this year I decided to treat myself to this Apple iPhone and it has not disappointed me wish I made the switch sooner.
"
6484,B08L5P5B68,5,"
My 8th iPhone and I couldn’t be happier. Got it at a good price. Purple is actually really nice. And it was £20 cheaper than the other colours.
"
6485,B08L5P5B68,3,"
£750 overheats after playing cod for more than 30 mins, even with graphics set to low and frame rate set to medium. It may be graphically 40% faster but only when not playing games especially COD. Game plays better on a Samsung s8 which is 5 years old. Very very disappointed with playing games on this massively overpriced, over hyped iPhone.
"
6486,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Really substantial upgrade from my iPhone 8, which was already a fantastic piece of kit. Just miss the sleek, more compact profile of my old phone too... this one is chunky in comparison. Having said that, the battery life, camera and screen blow the iPhone 8 out of the water. It really is effortless to take great shots with these two cameras! The screen is just fantastic. Feels solid, which is good because it is going to be with me for a few years yet given how overpriced these things are.
"
6487,B08L5P5B68,1,"
Bad experience getting this phone from amazon.  Call started to drop after a year. Amazon products support did not help keeping telling me the stuff which is common i.e restart the phin. Turn the aeroplane mode and then off etc. I have got the phone which doesn't work and have paid full price for it. Should have gone to Apple directly 🙄.
"
6488,B08L5P5B68,5,"

"
6490,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Fantastic phone.  Went from iPhone 7 to this one and never looking back even though I loved my 7.  Would not have any other product than Apple simply the best.  So easy to use and everything just went from one phone to this other with no sweat or swearing!
"
6491,B08L5P5B68,5,"
I’ve just upgraded from an iPhone 6 to this iPhone 12. Really pleased with it, very easy to use and very light. I am bias as I do prefer apple products to android.
"
6492,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Wonderful product and genuine without a doubt
"
6493,B08L5P5B68,5,"
It arrived the next day. The phone is slightly smaller than my old iPhone 8 Plus but it fits better in my hand now. The resolution is visibly better, not quite used to the face recognition yet but I’m sure I will get the hang of it
"
6494,B08L5P5B68,4,"
Coming from an old ‘window’ based phone, I found the iPhone great to use.. although not as intuitive to set up or find my way around.
"
6495,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Great phone. Snappy sharp and feels like good high-end quality. I really like it. It’s actually a perfect screen size for functionality in all senses for everyone. Not too big, and not too small, perfect for general use; browsing, Instagram, etc and brilliant OLED screen for Netflix with support for Dolby Vision. It is bright and responsive and fast in all conditions, including sunlight viewing. Do genuinely recommend, even though it’s a bit pricey.

 The appearance of the iphone 12 series has changed alot this time,the camera has also been enchanced a lot.The calculation and software have improved a lot, which is really great.especially the night shot taking is really good you can feel it on the screen,its tough level.If you are pursuing excellent camera functions and like Apple highly integrated ecological chain,then iphone 12 series is a very good choice and the choice will not make u regret it.Sending by my iphone12🥰🥰

Overall the IPhone 12 is a great phone bug like most apple products, you pay more for the apple logo on the back than the technology itself.

"

I am an Apple devotee, so, perhaps, slightly biased. As with all of the Apple products I have owned, superbly well made. Works and integrates with my other Apple products. Technology as it should be, in my view. One criticism, battery life could be better, but, I do get by with one charge per day.
"
6502,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Had it for two days now, used it constantly and only had to charge it once! I got in it purple and it’s really pretty, not too big which is nice and with a lot of nice features.
"
6503,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Bought this as soon as the iphone 13 was released because I knew the price would drop on the 12 and they would sell out quick. I was right.  Bought for a christmas present so haven't opened it.

Easy to use.  This is my first iPhone in over ten years and it’s lovely to use.  Takes amazing pictures.  Face ID - wow.  It just works.  Amazing.  Love the colour.After using this for a few days I’m not really sure I’ll go back to android
"
6507,B08L5P5B68,5,"
This is definitely the best iPhone I've owned and I've had them all since the iPhone 4 great build quality great battery life the screen looks amazing the stereo speakers are great too. The iPhone 12 doesn't come with charger or headphones which is a little disappointing but I use a wireless charger anyway so it didn't bother me . I usually go with product red but it looked a bit orange this year so got the blue version and I'm glad I did it looks stunning
"
6508,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Great everyday phone. One of the best iPhone I have had and used not to talk about the camera quality it’s absolutely great quality and battery life.
"
6509,B08L5P5B68,4,"
Got this for my wife for Christmas and she's enjoyed using it so far.However as a Samsung Galaxy S fan, I must say that a 60fps screen is a bit strange for flagship tier phones in 2020/21.

I love the way the phone itself is very colourful and I love all of the features including the face recognition and the layout of the apps is great. I absolutely love the screen size and it is just the right size to fit in your pocket

"
6514,B08L5P5B68,5,"
The Iphone12 is the best of the Iphones so far but the price is expensive ! However buying a sim free phone is cheaper in the long run as your not tied in on any contract! I am very happy with this phone you can do so much with it !
"
6515,B08L5P5B68,3,"
Frankly it was not much of an improvement on my IPhone 7, which my wife now has. The challenge of transferring data is far worse than the Apple solution suggests as it does not transfer music not bought from Apple. In addition, the developers seem to live in their own world which assumes that users are all geeks.

Not very good sound compared to Dolby on android but it is half the price of a top Samsung galaxy.Also could do with clearer display a bit of a let down but some apps are better and cheap for a 5 g mobile

Rip off. As has been said before, the lack of a charger is a total scam from Apple. Yes, Apple, you are reducing your carbon footprint and all that, but at the same time you are also making a tonne more revenue from accessory sales. If it was a genuine move, you'd supply a voucher code entitling buyers to order a charger for free. And the design to include a USB C cable? I mean what wall sockets have USB C? None. Who has a tonne of USB A power adaptors knocking around? Everyone. Simply including a cable that connects the phone to USB A would alleviate this issue, but no Apple in their wisdom assumes USB C is fine.I have  Macbook Pro which is generally fine and a phone could plug into that to charge, but I bought the phone for my teenage son. He'd never have an previous adaptor to use. I saw the light and switched to Samsung S series phones years ago. So his birthday present was almost useless out of the box - I wasn't even offered an upsell to get a charger at time of sale. I anticipate alot of moaning  in the coming days as he slowly starts to realise other short comings of this overpriced phone, but for me the no charger/USB C cable thing is a complete joke. AVOID!
"
6525,B08L5P5B68,3,"
5G on and off, used usb leads to charge which made sound muted, phone keep going headphones mode despite no headphones were attached. Requires phone to restart. Did not find Apple standard except the price which was as high as for Apple products.
"
6526,B08L5P5B68,5,"
The set up I had to do twice so make sure you update your old iPhone first. No instructions in box but lots of hints on phone. Took a while to work stuff out.
"
6527,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Everything about this phone is easy and very classy. It looks so very nice, easy to use, and a simple process transferring from one phone to another. I would recommend it to anyone.

 I bought this for my dad's birthday , the product description suggested its a ""New iPhone 12 128GB"", however it arrived in a brown Amazon box with bubble wraps inside. It didn't come with the official apple boxing and I have checked the serial number it was a refurbished iPhone.Won't recommend, this is not a brand new iPhone.
"
6530,B08L5P5B68,5,"
I was impressed with the delivery service, the phone arrived within 24hrs. Xfer of data from my iphone 6 was easy. Good phone at reasonable price.
"
6531,B08L5P5B68,1,"
I purchased this for 650 which is the same as apple store price for a new iPhone. This was advertised as new. However in the confirmation email it said old- like new. Battery life 98%. I immediately cancelled the delivery.
"
6532,B08L5P5B68,3,"
Okay - lots of good stuff: great camera, great speakers, amazing screen etc.  But one huge flaw: one of the points of upgrading to 5G is that you should be able to ditch your wifi (provided you're in a 5G area).  But, you can't, and here's why: you cannot back up your phone using 5G.  This makes no sense, as 5G is often faster than wifi.  So, that means I can't cancel my wifi that's costing me £35 a month - just to back up my iPhone!
"
6533,B08L5P5B68,5,"
It does what is written in the description.

I love this phone , the photo quality and edits are amazing.
"
6535,B08L5P5B68,2,"
I never write reviews on amazon, this is my first but I felt it was necessary as the iPhone 12 is an expensive product and I had high expectations for it. Undoubtedly Apple will launch and revision but for those of you who are thinking of buying this product, perhaps wait until everyone else who has ""tested"" this product for apple and exposed the bugs have helped refine the next version.Here are the issues I am experiencing:- Phone network reception just drops sporadically and does not restore itself, you need to restart the phone- Copy and paste does not work- The face recognition is not user friendly due to face masks or sunglasses, the thumb reader would be better under the circumstancesIf any of the above is a concern for you, consider something else.

I was hesitant at first with the price.I have always had Samsung mobiles but decided to buy Apple this time and what a excellent hand set this is.The operating system and performance it gives that’s why it’s one of the best iPhones on the market.

Can’t fault it . Photo id and Apple Pay are super easy to use! For some reason I expected iPhone 12 battery to last all day while watching videos which didn’t happen !
"
6552,B08L5P5B68,5,"
ok
"
6553,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Really pleased with this phone.Comes unlocked and sim free.Best iPhone to date.
"
6554,B08L5P5B68,5,"
I'm a Samsung person changed to Apple to see the fuss. An I love it all round easy to use. Brilliant phone.
"
6555,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Love this phone and after trying other competitors I won’t go past IPhone in future. Face recognition is spot on. Nothing I can say that’s bad about this phone. Highly recommend

I decided to upgrade from iPhone XR recently to IPhone 12, as I was led to believe the iPhone 12 had battery life/efficiency.Normal use on my previous IPhone XR would take my battery life up to late evening from a full charge the previous night, which I was more than happy with.Same charge on this IPhone 12 from Amazon gets me to about lunchtime. Totally disappointed in this product to say the least.  I’ve lost all confidence in purchasing from Amazon.I was led to believe the iPhone 12 had a so much better battery efficiency which was the reason of my purchase/upgrade.I can only assume this ‘new’ phone is a refurbished phone that no one else wanted and /or returned.I’m actually trying to finish this review before the battery runs out.  I kid you not.If I could give this review zero stars I would.Note to self==========Always go straight to Apple for Apple products, especially with the costs involved.  Never going to Amazon again for Apple products.

"

Replacement for iphone8. Took a bit of time to get used to different controls - eg no home button, but now love it. Combined with ios14 so easy to use. The only problem is it won’t recognise my face when I have a face mask on!
"
6560,B08L5P5B68,5,"
iPhones are so easy to use the battery life is good  pleased with purchase
"
6561,B08L5P5B68,1,"
Let me repeat, it didn't last 1, single, solitary week.Not 1.It didn't last 3 days.It lasted... 2... kinda.Galway through the second it started turning off with no warning.No problem, I'll just send it back... nah... Amazon don't like that. It's been over a month. I've talked to Amazon support more times in that period than I'd like to admit, more than I have to my grandparents. And they refuse to issue a refund. So, I have paid eight hundred pounds for the oh so enviable opportunity to peruse the Amazon support pages and struggle with their support team.The phone is probably fine but, and I can't stress this enough:DO NOT BUY THIS FROM AMAZON!Buy it from someone who accepts in person returns, like Apple or Curry's.AVOID AMAZON'S CUSTOMER SUPPORT AT ALL (and I do mean ALL) COSTS!
"
6562,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Love the face recognition, battery life and so easy to use. I wouldn’t be without it. Well worth the expense best decision ever to change my phone.
"
6563,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Do you like iOS? Do you want a reliable camera? Do you need iMessage? Get this and it'll last you a good four years.

"

"
6578,B08L5P5B68,5,"
I love my iPhone 12 so much that I just kissed it! Seriously though this is the one to get! The new design and incredible screen quality make the iPhone 12 so much better than the 11! And that’s not even mentioning 5G! Just buy it, you’ll love it!

"
6598,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Social media manager here, upgrade from iPhone Xr, not much a change except camera which is worth it for me. But it isn’t your job to take photos on your phone, but iPhone 11.
"
6599,B08L5P5B68,5,"
I had a iPhone X and upgraded to the iPhone 12I am a little disappointed that it has a few better upgrades from the iPhone XBut I think the technology on upgrades are very little
"
6600,B08L5P5B68,4,"
Battery life is rather disappointing after having had the XR which was excellent!
"

"
6606,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Upgraded from an iPhone 7 to the 12, so glad I did. The difference is like night and day.  If you’re looking to upgrade from an older iPhone, go for it.
"
6607,B08L5P5B68,5,"
I like this minty phone. I liked my dead iPhone 7. The face recognition is surprisingly good. I tried lots of different grimaces and it’s not fooled. Far far too expensive but otherwise a minty treat.

Bought this phone from Amazon on Prime Day - from a market place 3rd party seller sold 'via Amazon' and sadly discovered the phone had a 3rd party camera added to the phone and then sold as brand new.How do we know? - Apple confirmed that the serial number of the camera was not a genuine Apple camera serial number when they ran diagnostics and so this phone camera will never work and this iPhone was corrupted despite being sold as brand new boxed and wrapped. I will never buy an Apple phone or high-value phone from Amazon but only from the direct Apple shop - in the future. I would advise anyone to proceed with caution after my experience.Amazon has refunded me the cost of this phone.  Amazon is as always, excellent for their customer service so 5* for Amazon!  I am sorry that Amazon has such tricky sellers using their platform. It damages their reputation.

The phone developed a hardware fault within 30 days,contacted Amazon and was asked to return the phone for repair,almost 3 weeks later it was returned to me still in the same condition,took it to Apple which I should have done in the first place and it was repaired within the hourHave to say Amazon’s handling of this has been appalling I won’t be purchasing any more Apple products anytime soon
"
6715,B08L5P5B68,1,"
After less than 3 months the screen suddenly died. It’s now unusable and I’m told I need to spend £280 to get it fixed. Apparently the screen isn’t covered by the warranty. Absolutely disgusting, I’ll never buy another Apple product again. Not fit for purpose
"

Was great for the first month as soon as went past the returns window that’s when I started having issues, screen being intermittent, screen going black, calls dropping, phone not ringing I’ve had enough wish I never brought and that’s coming from someone who has had iPhone for the last 10 years

We upgrade our phones so you can expect better speed, better camera and better network, however, believe me, there is no difference whatsoever from iPhone 11 to 12, I have the disconnection issue since day one and its just worse than the iPhone 11I have found no speed difference with this upgrade and I have found that 11 camera is even better than 12 !!!  what is going on with Apple, they are just giving us the same old things in a new package !
"
6724,B08L5P5B68,5,"

Brand new phone, neary £700, it hardly holds a charge and takes 20 minutes to charge 5%.Apple checked the phone and said they would have provided a refund if I'd purchased with them, but as it's over 30 days old and I bought via Amazon, I'm offered the option of a 'repair'.Brand new phone, hardly used, needs to be repaired.I will never, ever buy an Apple product via Amazon again.

I recently purchased iphone 12 128 GB from amazon. I was excited to have this phone as it looks amazing and feels awesome in hand. However, Its battery doesn't lasted more than 4 hours of screen time. I am not sure if its just with me. I return this item to amazon and after 12 Days of returning this item finally I got my refund.I am disappointed with Iphone12 battery and amazon return service.

Bought this expensive phone, kept freezing. Within 1 month it failed completely and it seems you don’t get a refund but a repair which can take 2 weeks. Had to buy another phone and now have no confidence in the iPhone 12 and would rather have had a refund.

I thought I would upgrade from my XS Max to the iPhone 12. But I found out I had actually downgraded. I wouldn't go this route again.

The problem is Amazon delivery .. they say next day delivery but in fact you will never know. Their drivers play hide & seek .. very unreliable. My advise buy from a decent outlet .. not Amazon.

Phone arrived quickly.  After a few days the phone shut down and would not power back up.  Tried restart procedure but nothing so requested a return.  Item was returned with proof of postage on 28th June and still awaiting a refund.

I bought it 2-3 months ago but now the battery life decreased from 100% to 99%.

The signal drops out constantly when I’m trying to make calls and the internet looses its signal too. Keep needed to restart the phone which for the amount payed it is laughable.

The screen quality and battery life is not as good as the XR. Also, so many qliches and freezing that the xR never had.I’d go for the xR or 11 for a cheaper price and not an oled screen.

Do not buy, it’s not a new phone 12, arrived with the iPhone packaging removed, asked Amazon to sort it our told I have to wait three weeks don’t waste your money
"

The seller does not indicate the region of manufacture. The one i ordered was manufactured in Canada, which is why I can't loyalty cards to Apple Pay in the UK. My credit card works fine, so I have no complaints.

Phone quality is no better than Cheaper brands. Waste of money
"
6758,B08L5P5B68,1,"
It’s a great phone but it packed in working after 16 months - 4 months out of warranty. Apple want £465 to fix it even though they haven’t opened it to see what’s wrong. I’m hoping Amazon replace it under their 2 year warranty or I’ll have to invoke my consumer protection rights. £750 is a lot of money for something that stopped working after less than 2 years. Cosmetically it’s 100%. Not dropped or wet.Just waiting for Amazon to get back to my son, who bought me it as a special present.Gutted!

This phone i have only had a day and i have seen vast improvements to the older version of this phone and arguably the building blocks for this phone the iPhone 11. I bought the iPhone 11 and it was the replacement to my old iPhone XR. after having this phone for the short while i have the phone i have seen many aspects which make the upgrade worth it. This iPhone for starters has 5G and the phone also has a better chip. This Iphone has a new technology called super retina XDR display and this display is much better than the ones on the XR and 11 as they didn't even have the same pixel density as the iPhone 6! the other improvement is the the curved edges and this may sound like a weird point. However the phone is better looking and is more grippy to your hand, it also makes the phone feel newer as the older phones had slight curves in the screen which now look outdated. The sound quality is about the same as the 11 with stereo speakers. The next thing to point out is the bold colour choices, you can get plain white or black but there is also a purple, blue, green and red edition as well. I picked the blue colour and it is like a deep impact blue to the like of the blue you see many fords painted in the UK. The red is a slight salmon colour and you will think the phone is quite coral. the green is nice and looks minty. However the purple is a candy floss like colour and is a bold choice. However i don't think you will regret buying the purple one!. The last point of my review is the storage option and the base amount is 64GB and this is not enough if you have a lot of music and photos and apps then you will want the 128GB version at an extra £50 to the base model. if you are a hardcore Iphone user and feel as if you need 256GB of storage then my advice would be not to buy the basic 12 and get the Pro or pro max and get the upgraded storage option. Yes you will pay a bit more however you will not regret it as the pro and the pro max add a ton more features and have the more classy stainless steel bands and have 3 cameras. So thats my advice hope it helps!

I've always had cheaper Android phones, never wanted to spend Apple money. Not against the brand, but I don't like having expensive kit in my pocket. (I've had an old apple Ipad for years, so I'm not scared of Apple). Anyway, more recently I upgraded from a Huawei p20 lite - a £200 phone) to an Iphone 11, mainly driven by the better camera and thought It’s about time I treated myself to something a little more expensive, as I've never broken or lost a phone in my pocket.2 Weeks in and I'm still getting frustrated, I just can’t do the things I would expect from a phone!My main gripes are:*I have 25 Gb of photos on my Android, I just want to move them over. I don’t want my photos on the cloud, I have enough backups. I just want them physically on the iPhone. it seems the latest ios has blocked direct transfer from Windows (I can see the file, just cant paste to it). All other routes are extremely painful. Just let me drag and drop please!!!*Same goes in reverse – considering the main reason I bought the phone was for the camera. I own my photos, why can’t I just easily take them off my phone. I don’t want them in the cloud, I don’t want them hidden when I delete them. I want direct access to my own files please.*This was my first IPhone, so I was expecting the transition to be nice. Open the box and no USB adapter??? There is a USB C lead, but who has a USB C charger? All my wall plates around the house are USB A. My car is USB A. My PC is USB A. great, so I need to spend another £20 to use my phone, and another £20 updating all my leads in my car, at work etc.*To the above point, why isn’t this just a USB C standard?*If transferring photos is difficult, everything else seems impossible. Absolutely no visibility of folder structure in windows.*The phone is bulkier and a lot heavier than my P30 lite, and so far I haven't seen anything to benefit the extra mass or bulk.I really wanted to love this phone, but so far all I want to do is just return it and go back to my old phone which is 1/3 of the price.

Finally upgraded from iPhone 6s. Loving the speed, the screen, the camera’s Bokeh feature. Great phone. Bought it from John Lewis. To my disappointment they further reduced the price 2 days later. BUT I discovered they actually price match themselves and they gave me a refund of the difference - no quibbles. Excellent!
"
6764,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Love this new phone. Not had an apple iPhone before. It’s easy to use still learning about it but delighted with it so far.
"
6765,B08L5P5B68,5,"
My first iPhone since the iPhone 6, so far I am very happy with it. Coming from android I was happy with the The user layout. It is very intuitive and easy to navigate the build quality of the phone is very sturdy and light but so light it’s at risk of feeling “cheap”. This is really nitpicking. The phone’s snappy response means all tasks I throw at it are carried out smoothly and effortlessly.Bad points: no charger is a pain in the backside! Not having a usb c powerbrick to hand meant I had to revert to an old iPad charger I luckily had. Why they went for a lightning port to usb C I will never know as it is the most pointless and least available connection. (At least to me) I have now swapped back to a lightning to usb 2.0 and normality is restored (yes the charging is not as fast anymore) overall a good purchase in my opinion but I might not be able to say the same If I was coming from an iPhone 11 or similar.Overall, a good phone to consider if you are due an upgrade or like me have an older phone dying a horrid death! I’m sure there’s others out there who will say Android is better and to be quite honest I believe both have their flaws and benefits.
"
6766,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Ignore the reviews from people who haven’t bought one, that’s laughable. Yes the phone doesn’t come with headphones or a power plug but it’s hard to believe you would really need another power plug if you’re in the market for this phone. Just wasted plastic at this point. Having said that I did upgrade to a usb-c power plug and it charges from dead to full in 1hr 30 and fast charges to 50% in 30 minutes, the battery also holds charge a lot longer than a phone you’re likely to be upgrading from like an old 7, 8, X. The most impressive feature is the camera with night mode and wide angle. The Oled screen is also stunning especially if you turn the lights off and watch a Dolby vision video. This will be the phone that people own for 5+ years without needing an upgrade. When you think the iPhone X was released at £1000, this is a much more refined product and coming in £200 cheaper.
"
6767,B08L5P5B68,5,"
Absolutely love this phone and have no issues with the product itself. Word of warning though: if you don't own an Apple computer, you will need to purchase additional accessories separately. The lightning cable included in the box has a USB-C connector which can't be plugged into a standard Windows PC or plug from an older iPhone model.

Upgrading from the XR you see the difference between  4g and 5G. Overall the design on the apps and UI (user interface ) feels nicer to the eye and more snappy the oled screen is great for dark gritty films. Despite its price and apples ups and downs with privacy and god knows what else the phone delivers on many fronts however the worst part of the product lies with the battery. I hope one day I could make my battery last a week without a charge, I don’t use it too much and it lasts roughly 3 days but while at work I have to charge it every morning

I had struggled along for a while with my old 6s. Big mistake. Bought the twelve after reading all the reviews of 11-13.  Very easy to set up from cloud. Love the magnetic cordless charging. Battery life seems endless compared to old phone. I do lots of calls,emails and SMS/WhatsApp messages and calls. Don't use camera that much. Great phone.

Love the phone, great functionality, good size to see/hold and crystal clear screen etcMost people who buy these have already looked up the spec so I won’t go into that side, but I do know you will enjoy using this beautiful phone and all it’s features.There are some cheaper very good phones out there, but I like the reliability of Apple phones and they are always in good enough working condition to pass down to grandchildren when you upgrade

It was time to retire my 6s after many years of loyal service.I kept waiting for Apple to bring the fingerprint back but as it wasn’t happening got this one.Great phone otherwise but the face recognition doesn’t work half the time. It’s a problem in the shops, in the dark, when wearing a hat and sunglasses and sometimes just for no reason at all. Please bring back the fingerprint!Why Apple and not Samsung or any other phone brand? Cause of security! And because they stand up to Facebook and other companies that want your private data to sell you more stuff and make money off of you! Google for example should give their phones to people for free seeing how much they “spy” on their users.

I am an iPhone user and I’ve had iPhones since the 3G version many, many years ago.This is my 1st with an OLED screen. For me personally, iPhones have gotten a bit chunky over the last few years and have gotten thicker each year since the 6 and 6S.The iPhone 12 is only 7.4mm thick with a super glossy 6.1“ screen which reminds me of the iPhone 4 with its straight aluminium sides and for me it’s perfect.I have small hands and this is probably a little bit big for me to use comfortably but I think that 6.1” is the perfect size screen for trolling the net and using Safari so I’ll put up with having to use 2 hands every now and then.The battery is comparable to the XR I had previously and the blue colour matches my Apple Watch 6 perfectly.I bought the 128gb version to help with resale prices next year but 64GB for me would have been enough as I still have 102gb free after 2 months use. (As a guide I have 79 songs, 3 videos and 169 photos, I’m certainly not a heavy user! )If you are reading this and are thinking of buying one, the iPhone 13 will be out in a few months and it’s expected to have a slightly faster processor and a different camera arrangement and new colours. It may be the 12S, it may be the 13, but in my opinion you can always miss a year out.This phone is well made, takes great photos and has a sublime screen with iMessage as well as 5G (which I’ve tried using O2) and the benefit of the best App Store in the world. Buy it and enjoy the Apple experience.

 I have an iphone 11 and am very happy with it, I purchased an iphone 12 for my wife as a Birthday present and have been comparing the 2 phones, I really like feel of the iphone 11 which is an aluminium frame the iphone 12 does not have the same premium feel, it is a lot lighter in the hand, the 11 has rounded edges whereas the 12 has flat.Speed wise using you cannot tell a difference, we are both using 4G, when my wife changes her contract and opts for one with 5G her smartphone will be a lot faster.Both smartphones outperform the cheaper brands when receiving text messages, and Whatsapp and also email messages.
"
6798,B08L5P5B68,5,"
A fantastic product to use. Data transfer was a breeze. Battery life is excellent. A couple of minor glitches in software which I am sure will be fixed in future releases e.g. during a WhatsApp video call if you toggle between screens then video keeps dimming after every few seconds.

Great phone, amazing screen and just easy to use. Best feature of iPhones is the software and all the integrations with Apple products. I personally would have liked a bigger battery as it goes down relatively fast when using 5g during the day. But overall I must admit that for the average user (me) iPhone never lets you down.

There are plenty of reviews for iPhone 12's out there so I'll stick to the Amazon experience. The price undercuts purchasing direct. One day later I got a SIM-free iPhone 12 in the branded box ready to stick my own SIM straight in. Worked like a dream and I spent less than buying direct - especially as I was happy to get the blue as it was a bit cheaper for some reason (but who cares when it spends all its life in a case!).

Apple prices are always high in comparison with other iPhones, and Apple is mean with supplying essential accessories, like charging connectors. However, this is made up ( I think ), by quality, design and after sales service as well as providing at east 5 years of critical updates.

Off course it could be cheaper and the battery life longer but you pay for what you get.

It’s an iPhone and it does that well, nothing more to say really it’s compact and well priced. Not sure it’s any upgrade from an 11 in normal use ,

This will be a long and detailed review. I am writing this to guide those who are hesitant whether to get an iPhone or not, and which iPhone to get. I will start by focusing on the iPhone 13 Pro model, but I will speak more generally towards the end, especially when comparing iOS versus Android Products.iPhone 13 Pro Overview:I had the chance to unbox this device and set it up as my new main device. Prior to this I was using a Samsung Note and a Realme smartphones.- Box Contents and Eco-Friendliness:The iPhone 13 Pro box contains paper leaflets, sticker, a cable, and of course phone. The phone itself is wrapped in recyclable material rather than eco-unfriendly plastic. Part of the switch to Apple is what I personally see as an effort from them to go green, in addition to other reasons I will discuss below.- Design and Build Quality:The iPhone 13 Pro is simply amazing in terms of design. Holding it feels almost like holding the previous 12 Pro model, albeit the 13 Pro comes with noticeable bigger cameras and smaller notch.The body is flawless and the graphite option is the best in my view as I like neutral-lowkey'ish colours. The other colours are equally appealing but the graphite just felt suitable for my personal tastes. The side frame is stainless steel and the whole phone feels really solid. I have seen JerryRig's video where he tries to bend the iPhone 13 Pro and phone managed to survive and stay fully intact. Jerry also used a lighter to try and burn the screen, and it didn't! Despite being exposed to continuous lighter flames for around a minute (You should check it out).Compared to the 12 Pro, the iPhone 13 Pro is slightly heavier (209g vs 189g) and slightly thicker (7.7mm vs 7.4mm).- Specs:Stats are the last thing I consider recently since most flagships pack the latest technology and all fly through tasks easily. We seem to live in an age where the hardware capabilities is outweighing the requirements of most, if not all, apps and games.The iPhone 13 Pro packs a 3095 mAH battery which is bigger and better than the previous iPhone 12 Pro's battery. It has a Super Retina XDR OLED display with a 120HZ refresh rate (Finally they left the old 60HZ rate). The refresh rate is variable, meaning that drops for less demanding apps, which adds to the preserving of energy. The display is very bright and can be seen easily and clearly in bright daylight. It has a brightness of 1000nits with a peak of 1200nits. It packs the latest Apple A15 bionic 5 nanometer chip. This chip provides fast performance and adds to iPhones' AI capabilities. The GPU has five cores compared to four in the 12 Pro. The  iPhone 13 Pro comes with 6GB of RAM but we know that doesn't really matter since it is faster than phones with 12GB of RAM. So enough with the dull specs and lets talk about the actual performance!- Speed and Responsiveness:The iPhone, iPad and MacBook family is well-known for its flawlessness in terms of responsiveness, and this iPhone 13 Pro is no different. Expect a very fast performance that wouldn't degrade for years. Apps open fast and all operations happen seamlessly. Although the iOS 15 is relatively a new update, there isn't much bugs around, and a couple small bugs highlighted by customers have already been patched.- Battery Life and charging:The iPhone only comes with a lightning cable, so if you never owned an Apple device you may need to get a wall plug. The iPhone only requires 23W load, but it still supports a convenient level of fast charging, making it able to go from 0% to 50% in 30 minutes. I think Apple could have gone way higher in terms of load, and way lower in terms of charging time, but that would equally reduce the shelf life of the battery and makes it degrade quickly, so a sweet middle spot is more convenient for long term owners. A fully charged iPhone 13 Pro would sustain you for the whole day, with around 30% remaining at the end of the day. My test is based on a day of regular surfing, watching videos, taking pictures and videos (like stories and reels), and casual gaming (like candy crush). The battery performance is way better than the 12 Pro in my opinion, and second just to the 13 Pro max.Note: there are phones that go from 0% to 60 or 80% in way less time than the iPhone 13 Pro. As I have said those phones are speculated to degrade the battery life span faster and release a lot of heat, but it is up to you to decide your preferences, especially if you constantly forget to charge your phone at night and you require very fast charging.- Camera Quality and Modes:Over the years, iPhones never possessed the best camera title. Rather, they managed to earn the best round-up camera performance. For instance, there are telephoto lenses better than the iPhone 13 Pro telephoto, and a wide angle that's better than the iPhone 13 Pro. however, in my view there is no phone that combines a robust multi-lens performance as good as the iPhone does. If you want a versatile camera, an incredible bokeh effect, a crisp and sharp video with the best stabilisation I ever tried, and an amazing post-production processing and editing, then I am certain no phone can outweigh the current iPhone 13 Pro and Pro max. The quality is simply amazing and the software support accompanying the camera app is what sets this years head of the rest. I advise you to check videos that showcase the camera performance.- Software Support and iOS 15:There are many people out there who don't understand why people pay much for iPhones. These people are usually unaware of the seamlessness created by the Apple eco-system. Having an iPhone, iPad, MacBook, and to a lesser extent a watch and earbuds, is the only resort for you to understand how the ecosystem works. I was suspicious a year ago but once into the ecosystem, I am certain that there is no other combination of devices out there that can achieve the same ecosystem.The iOS 15 update, and soon the Mac Monetary update, are expected to take this ecosystem to an even higher league. For instance, and at this particular moment, I can copy the text I am writing on my MacBook and just press paste on my iPad or iPhone and it will paste. I can use my iPad as a secondary screen by pressing a single button. I can create a work routine or a set of actions once I activate Focus Mode, and my devices can even inform people on iMessage that I am busy or not available. I can start a task in one device, work on it somewhere else with another device without the need to login again or try to get access or upload stuff here and there.The ecosystem is indeed a closed system. This can be discouraging for some but it equally creates a chain of cohesive actions that facilitate your daily tasks.I will not talk much about iOS 15 and leave you the pleasure to explore that. Else you can check relevant videos to see the new features.- PrivacyPerhaps one of the main reasons that dragged me towards Apple in general is their emphasis on data protection and privacy. The new Private Relay and Hide my Email features are nothing but evidence on how serious Apple is about privacy. I feel more secure inside this ecosystem and more in control of what I want to share/not share with other parties.- Final Verdict:The final verdict is mixed and conditional. The main thing to say is that the iPhone 13 Pro, like the other flagships in the markets, packs the latest technology available. Whether it is right for you or not depends on how you answer the following:1. Do you own other Apple products? If you already own a MacBook, and iPad, an Apple Watch, or a combination of all then the iPhone would make things even better.2. Do you own an iPhone and you are uncertain about upgrading: If you have an iPhone 11 or lower then I would advise you to upgrade if you can afford the 12 Pro. The major differences would be the battery life, the display, and the cameras. These are MAJOR differences and will make you feel a huge difference. If you own the iPhone 12 Pro I would advise you to not upgrade, unless you really crave the latest technology and cannot live without the new cameras and higher refresh rate. You won't feel a MAJOR difference, but the difference will be noticeable.3. Are you switching from Android to iOS? My short answer will be: If you don't mind a closed system that would function better if you own other Apple products then definitely go for it. The future of privacy and protection seems better with the iPhone (personal view). Plus, with the iPhone you get loads of software updates and Apple will not discontinue their support after two years like most others do. Switching from Android/Windows to Apple is gradual and starts with one device. I started with one device and now own 4 devices that make my life easier.4. Should you go with the mini, the 13, the 13 Pro or the 13 max? If your current phone is smaller than the iPhone 13 and you hate bulky and big devices then go with the mini. If your priority is having the latest all rounder without necessarily flexing in terms of performance then go with the 13. If you want the most iPhones can offer, you game a lot, or you are into photography like me then go with the 13 Pro. If the 13 Pro looks small in your eye and you want something that falls between a smartphone and tablet in terms of size, along with the highest battery capacity possible then consider the 13 Pro Max. But before you decide on this, think about your budget and whether you can afford your preferred phone or not.5. Should you go for the 12 Pro over the 13 Pro? At this particular time NO. The 12 Pro is still expensive and I wouldn't pay that much for it. If you can afford a brand new 12 Pro then save a little more and get a 13 Pro. If you want a 12 Pro wait till January and prices may go lower.6. If you think that the iPhone is expensive then check other brands and you will realise that they are charging the same amount or almost the same amounts without offering the same level of support and updates.I may update this review as I use my phone and discover new stuff. I hope you find this helpful and I hope I managed to assist you in making a decision. I will include samples of pictures taken by my 13 Pro soon, I may also include a video or two.Important: If you read this review and found it helpful you might find my Apple Watch Series 7 review helpful as well. Just click on my profile picture and you will see it as the first review on my profile.

Maybe this will get something done!I am a very very unhappy customer.25th November I contacted customer services as my phone wouldn’t charge or power up at all. I was asked to send my phone together with the PIN number so the repairs team could access my phone and that it would take 14 days from receipt to fix or refund.I duly sent my phone with all the details requested.  Having not heard anything i called to check if it had been received as the status was showing as not yet and the woman confirmed it had been received that morning and would be 14 days from then.On the 13th i realised I still have not heard anything so run an amazon search in my emails and see UK Norwich Amazon come up in the search. I click the email to see if it was connected to the repair and it was an email saying that they had tried to contact me to give them information and as I had not replied they would be sending my phone back to me un repaired via DPD within 3-5 days.I emailed back to say this is the first email I have seen and what was the status of my phone. The response to this was it was not fixed and being sent via Royal Mail. I was very cross about this as not only have I been told different things with regards to timescales (it is at. This point 3 weeks without my phone). I respond to say as much and Gary at Norwich repairs respond highlighting his email saying he said Royal Mail and quite rudely telling me there was no mention of DPD. I responded with the email from Norwich saying DPD two days earlier and asked for a refund as they cannot repair, I was ignored.I contacted amazon directly to try and get this resolved. The first person i speak with, tells me they have escalated to the repairs team and no i cannot speak with a manager because they have left the room. I said I will wait, she put me on hold and then cut me off.  I call back and the man I speak with is more helpful but again the manager he puts me through to tells me, she is going to issue me a refund and confirms my card details and then comes back and says it has to be the repairs team and she has escalated it.I then get an email from Norwich saying my phone has not actually been sent to me yet. Despite it apparently being sent to me four days ago 13th December. The 16th Dec I call and speak directly to Gary and ask for the refund.  Gary said this is not something they can do and that Amazon have misinformed me and that he will reply in an email to say as much.I call Amazon back after Gary sent an email confirming it is no them who issue the refund and the man i speak to tried to help as best he can but again, he asks me to sen him screen shots of the emails which i do but we get no where. He is told to give me this email and; that I am to wait for my broken phone to be sent back to me which is delayed by 4 days already, and over the 14 days for a return or refund, for me to them get back in contact once I receive the broken phone to send it back to you to start this whole process back again.THIS IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH - This is terrible customer service. Please can you just refund me. You have sold me a phone that doesn’t work, i have done as you asked and I do not have the phone, amazon do. I should not be being asked to jump through hoops. I have rights as a consumer and I have requested my refund several times now.Please can you issue me my refund as you are unable to repair the item, you as yet have not sent me the item and I need to go and purchase another.I have been without my phone for 23 days now.Overall I have been sold a dud iPhone and then poor customer service. Am out of pocket by over £1000 and still without my money or my phone.

I hesitated for weeks before placing my order. I had an old iPhone SE that I loved and stubbornly refused to let go, replacing the battery a year ago. But the screen started to glitch in the summer, pink lines everywhere, black stain spreading at the top. Still I could not order a new one as I just did not like them; they seemed way too big. I liked the colour of the iPhone 14 but saw it in store and hated the glass back (fingerprints everywhere). Ended up ordering the 13 pro after watching many videos and I love it. Yes it’s much bigger than the SE but I got used to it in a couple of days. And the colour is beautiful. It is extremely expensive but hopefully I can keep it for years. The pictures taken so far are stunning. I recommend it.

It arrived so fast! I am using the cellphone for two months now and the battery it's good, but as I use it a lot I charge it every day. For me, the highest point is the camera, we get a very good image even with poor light. Also, the velocity to open the apps, change the screen or delete apps and photos is awesome. I really recommend the purchase.

Bought this as a “like new” big discount. It was sent quickly and when it arrived it came in the original package, cable and manuals were even included. To my surprise the device was shiny new, 100% battery health. On settings only shown that it had the rear system had been replaced and it was genuine.

I don't write reviews in general but this time my experience was so bad that I have to review this purchase.As from the headline, I bought three times an iPhone 13 pro, and each time I returned the product because in each case the iPhone was defective.At first, I bought a pre-owned iPhone 13 pro from Amazon Warehouse. The iPhone was in good shape with no scratches at all. Unfortunately, as soon as I switched on the iPhone, I realized the phone was not able to find any mobile network, as if the sim card was not present in the phone. However the sim card was inserted, meaning that this was clearly an issue of the iPhone. It was a Graphite iPhone, whose box is in picture denoted as 1. I understand this is a pre-owned phone and there could be some imperfections, but it is not acceptable that Amazon does not verify if the phone works or not. I guess the quality checks are quite poor if faults like this are not detected before selling the phone.I returned this iPhone and I decided not to trust Amazon Warehouse, so I bought a new one, you can see it in the two pictures denoted as 2. The phone was perfectly working but after a while I noticed a cosmetic imperfection on the camera section. As you can see in the picture, the black circle of the sensor has something like a smear that makes the circle not perfectly circular. I could not have done this damage because the smear is under the glass of the camera. At this point I thought: Why should I keep a defective phone, considering that I paid almost 1000 pounds for it and that, if I want to sell it one day, someone may notice the imperfection and give me less money?I guessed I had been quite unlucky with the two iPhones so I decided to return this second iPhone and to order a third one.The third iPhone 13 pro arrived in the conditions shown in the two pictures denoted as 3. I could not believe it, but there were a small scratch on the upper frame of the phone and some scratches on the grey band on the lateral frame. Notice that these pictures were taken immediately after removing the phone from the box, so I could not have caused these scratches. Again, for the same reasons as the previous one, I did not accept this iPhone and I immediately returned it.At this point my opinion was that it was not me being unlucky, but Apple production/quality check must be very poor and I really lost esteem for this company.At the end I bought a 4th iPhone 13 pro, which fortunately is in good conditions. But during all this procedure of returning and buying iPhones I lost a lot of time and patience and I put a lot of money since I had to buy a new one before the refund for the previous one arrived.I am really unsatisfied both for Amazon Warehouse for the first iPhone and for Apple for the remaining two.

Love the phone, it’s my first time using an IPhone and it’s surprisingly really easy. Huge upgrade from my S10 Plus.
"
6850,B09V4P7XP9,5,"
This iPhone is honestly amazing. The battery can last all day and the camera is phenomenal, the colour is beautiful and the screen is really good and charging is really quick as well.You don’t need a 14 pro/14, just buy a 13 pro/13 and you’ll be really happy because the 13 and 14 are literally the same phone but the 13 is cheaper and will last a really long time.Summery the 13 pro is an amazing phone and I recommend this to everyone.
"
6851,B09V4P7XP9,5,"
This is my first iPhone and it's been a great experience so far. The phone feels durable and I love the size - I am not a fan of huge phones, so if you are you should consider the pro-max. Would highly recommend.

Very happy with this phone.Is my first iPhone, as I always had Windows Phone and then Android, but now I don't think I could go back.Apple is super pricey so I think I will keep this phone for many years, but generally, I'm happy and the color is stunning.Great battery life, great photos, and videos, very smooth.

Bought for my eldest daughter to replace an iPhone 11 which had a cracked screen (since fixed and that phone now with my youngest daughter). This is a lovely phone and she's over the moon with it - as alwasy Amazon was exceelent, delivery was next day and we've had no problems at all.

Having loved from an iPhone X to this one has been a whole new world specially in battery life, very happy.

Once you’re hooked into the Apple ecosystem they’ve got you - I usually buy new phones every couple of releases/years so came to this from an 11Pro. Incremental updates rather than blow away features. I also buy the handsets sim free and this enables me to have a small £10 per month sim only tariff but it’s swings and roundabouts.
"
6861,B09V4P7XP9,4,"
Nice phone but way too overpriced
"
6862,B09V4P7XP9,3,"
Wasn’t what I expected
"
6863,B09V4P7XP9,5,"
Get the Pro. I'd never had a Pro before, I didn't see the point. The camera is the point! We all think ""Oh I don't take that many pictures anyway"", you definitely take more than you realise. The quality is stunning, there are so many modes and ways of editing, it's just superb!If anyone is coming from an XS, like me, this one does not have a glass back, I promise. It's titanium I think and properly damage resistant.The battery lasts astonishingly long. I got nearly 2 full days of regular use out of a fully charged 13 Pro battery when I got it.Just brilliant, 100% just spend the extra money and enjoy a quality product :)

Had a trusty iPhone 7 for the past four or five years then battery life dropped off and became near useless for a whole day without chargingUpgraded to the iPhone 13 pro, night and day for the battery, I can easily get two to three days usage. Size is good though slightly bigger than the iPhone 7, weight takes a little get used to. Performance and experience is better though the iOS is the same, overall very happy with the upgrade. Let’s see if it can last 4 or 5 years

Face  recognition was new to me and I love it. The lack of home button is new to me also and so much easier. The camera is terrific and the battery life will take several hours of continuous google maps use.

This iPhone is really handsome.The camera offers near perfect perfection and the zoom lens is an improvement this time around.The general functions on the iPhone are more fluid and the colour pixelation is greatly improved.Battery life has also been improved.Buy yourself this phone while you can because this is a real market leading winner from Apple.

Received this phone yesterday. It has a problem with a grey tint on 90% of the screen. Apple advise to return. Amazon refuse to allow me to return until Apple issue a letter of denial, whatever that is. Not sure what to do - - stuck with £1000 phone that doesn’t work and Amazon won’t exchange.Update: went to Apple store, who confirmed that there is a problem and said they would have replaced there and then if I hadn’t bought from Amazon. They did not know what a letter of denial was. Having spoken to a senior Apple engineer, advice was to insist Amazon accept it as a return especially as it’s less than a week old. Phoned  Amazon, very helpful man said he couldn’t action a return as it is a high value item. Am waiting another call….so less than a week, a non working phone and not sure what happens next…But moral is Amazon aren’t good if things go wrong …

6897,B09V4P7XP9,5,"
Best iPhone ever, until the iPhone 14.The camera is the most impressive feature of the new iPhone 13, it's just insanely good for non-professional use.I think the cinematic mode is a bit gimmicky, but it's fun to play with.
"
6898,B09V4P7XP9,5,"
Excellent phone would advise to upgrade if you can safe up.
"
6899,B09V4P7XP9,5,"
First upgrade since I got the XR in 2020 and it feels completely different. The communication between the OS and the New Tech is absolutely seamless and fast with all the camera and phone operating speed.

I bought this device to replace a battered second-hand iPhone 11 and I love this phone.The battery life on this phone is exceptional and can easily last a day or even up to 1.5 days depending on usage. With the 120hz refresh rate, you can see the difference in speed and opening up apps in comparison to a 60hz phone.I love to take pictures/random pictures daily and this phone captures amazing photos during the day and the low light photography on this iPhone is one of the best you can get anywhere. The photos come out light, bright and crispyNow, a little negative for some would be the weight of this phone as it weighs just over 200g and can put some weight in your pockets, but it does fit perfectly in pockets/handbags, unlike the bigger 13 Pro Max. But this isn't really a problem for meWould I recommend his phone? hmm, only if you have the budget and absolutely have to have the best of the best tech and battery life. Otherwise, I'd say go with the regular 13 or even the 13 mini

It's pointless to buy iPhones for basically new price after a year... you've already lost nearly 20% of it's supported life (usually about 5-6 years)... so it's actually costing you more, per year, to buy these phones than when new...! irrespective of how nice, fast, how good camera is or how incredibly dated and old-fashioned the entire home screen and 'flow' interface is.
"
6927,B09V4P7XP9,4,"
Go for it. Such a magic is 13 pro. No words to describe its beauty. Camera with Inbuilt filter is awesome
"

Arrived quickly and packaging was spot on! This phone is bang on!  nice screen quality and very responsive.I’ve upgraded from the iPhone 11 and there’s a great difference in camera quality resolution quality as well although it’s a wee bit chunky this is by far a better phone! A Well recommend upgrade 👍👌
"

Always had iPhone as they are the best in the business but……..No plug charger with a phone just sort of £1000 and also, I’ve got an iPad Pro and the cables are different connections which is so annoying.Come on Apple, we pay a premium already to buy the best but penny pinching isn’t on!!!
"
6930,B09V4P7XP9,5,"
I Didn’t Buy This From Amazon Unfortunately But I Bought It From The Apple Store Itself But I Just Wanted To Put My Experience With The Phone On Here Well First Of All This Phones 120hz I can tell immediately near my iPhone 10And these new cameras are worth the whole 949 pounds I paid and the 128gb is more than enough considering iCloud storage and the colour I hope they keep for next year .

7 years with Samsung, finally got bored of all the hype and broken promises so moved back to apple and pleased to say that I am very happy with it. Android to apple data migration is a pain and still have some issues with basic services due to android placing some sort of plan on my number, who will not help. Annoying. However, this phone is bang on. Every app just works and the cameras (especially recording) are great fun.
"
6932,B09V4P7XP9,5,"
I’ve been with Android for 11 years and decided to change to the 13 pro and honestly this phone is unbelievably good. The 120hz display is very fluid and lovely to use, the camera quality is the best I’ve seen on any phone, I love IPhone cameras anyway but this takes it to another level. Also, the speaker quality is so clear and crisp, along with being the loudest I’ve heard on a phone. The Battery life is phenomenal, I can easily get around 9 hours screen on time. Only downsides are it hasn’t got usb c charging and the facial recognition doesn’t work with masks on. Other than that it’s an amazing phone, go and get one, you won’t regret it!

Hi  I would really like to warn everybody about the iPhone 13 Pro as it is really not working properly.  I got the new iPhone 13 Pro just before Christmas and it was very faulty, and EE sent me out a new one, which turns out to be very faulty too.  Since I’ve had new replacement phones now, they will not give me a new phone, but a refurbished one as I am now over the Moth period and this is extremely unfair. As you may, or not be aware of, the Americans are extremely Superstitious and usually they don’t have anything to do with the number 13 and when building they do not have a thirteenth floor in any of their hotels or skyscrapers.  This is why it doesn’t make sense that they brought out the new iPhone as the number 13?  It has been unbelievable and I’ve not had a pleasurable experience with the iPhone13 Pro and I would like to let all those who are extremely superstitious to stay away from this new iPhone and If they do get one, then you’ve all been warned.
"
6934,B09V4P7XP9,4,"
I've been using a Pixel 6 Pro and an iPhone 8 as my daily usage phones until I finally decided to buy the iPhone 13 Pro (note: I bought this in a shop, since Amazon had no stock at the time - I bought the Graphite 13 Pro with 256GB storage). I will give my thoughts and experiences from an unbiased view of both an Android and iOS userFirstly, you notice the build quality. This is something Apple has always done really well, and really, nobody else seems to have caught up. It just has such a pleasant feeling holding it hand. No Android phone I've come across in my time (I'm including all flagship phones), have ever managed to replicate that same feeling. I'm talking about holding the phone when it's switched off. It just oozes quality, and I must admit nobody have matched them on this front.The display is the next thing you notice, it's really nice with a crisp display, with high enough pixel density that you cannot see the pixels. I also like the fact the whites seems naturally to be a warmer than my android phones which seem to have a slightly bluer tint to them. Also it's the brightest display I've come across, turning that and the Pixel 6 Pro to max brightness, and there's no competition. If you're the phones side by side in bright daylight, you're definitely going to see the iPhone better.Security unlocking. Previously I've been used to using a finger print sensor. Apple have FaceID, and I must say it's pretty neat, certainly less fuss than fingerprint scanner, especially if you're outside and wearing touch screen compatible gloves. I've noticed you can't have the phone too close to your face though, so a good half arms length away is a minimum. The bigger issue though is in the world of Covid and facemasks, I found it simple doesn't work with a facemask on. I've been told you can work around this by buying an Apple Watch though - but of course that's significant additional cost (plus you might actually prefer a different brand watch).Pros- Very wide aperture (f1.5 main lens) cameras with nice large sensors make for great low light photography- Finally a 3x zoom lens- Lovely display, very nice to look at. Can go very bright, brighter than other phones.- Phone is super responsive, scroll is much smoother than the iPhone 8, and I'd say marginally better than the Pixel 6 Pro in that respect- Magsafe a very nice addition for wireless charging - works really with (so long as you don't use a case or a compatible case)- Battery lasts the whole dayCons- Lacks fingerprint scanner- Face ID not well adapted to the world of facemasks- Protruding camera lens cluster affects usage with some wireless charging stands- Pixel 6 Pro offers 4x zoom lens, rivalling picture quality and neat exclusive AI photo processing for significantly less money. (But that phone's not perfect either)- Still uses lightning adaptor for charging as opposed to USB-CIssues with in general I found migrating from Android to iOS, not necessarily iPhone 13 Pro specifically- Whatsapp won't (at time of writing) transfer chat history from Android to iOS, requires paying for 3rd party solutionNote I've put a screen protector and camera lens protector on it from new. Also, I use a case, so these might show in some of the pictures.Summary:At £949 for the base model, you get a very nice premium product. However on balance, in my opinion it's not a clear winner vs the Pixel 6 Pro which I've been using day to day along side it.If you are already Apple invested and you're running an iPhone 11 or older, then it's a clear purchase - it's probably not worth your hassle converting to android for the current offerings at this time.If you have a recent flagship Android phone, again I wouldn't recommend switching over to iOS just for this phone. (I took the plunge because my car only supports CarPlay and I was replacing an iPhone 8).If you have an iPhone 12, then it's a tough call. Yes it's a better camera, but is it enough to justify the huge cost of upgrade? - I probably wouldn't.Overall, it's a really good phone with an outstanding camera, but it's not perfection

How can a phone cost over £1000 and you don't get no charger or headphone in the box
"
6936,B09V4P7XP9,5,"
Upgraded from an iPhone 6s. Massive upgradeBattery lasts for a day.Screen is amazing.Speakers are louder and clearer.Phone is slightly thicker and with square edges can dig in fingers as it’s a bigger phone than the 6s. But a good case will sort this.  Done get this wrong the phone looks amazing so worth the design choiceChose this over the max as you can still use this one handed.Invest in a fast charger as Charing with the old iPhone chargers takes forever. If you charge overnight then no problem but on that rare occasion the battery is low the old charger will feel like an eternity to charge

I’ve moved from an XR; decent enough all rounder but still average battery life and a mediocre camera.This is almost the same size but noticeably heavier but it feels so much more “ premium.”Battery life is at least doubled and the camera really is outstanding. I’m no pro but attached a macro and a sunset shot just to show off it’s capabilities.I got the 256GB for the additional video feature which I’ve yet to use.A superb piece of kit protected by an OtterBox Strava folio case; also superb.

With the exception of some small differences the iPhone 13 Pro looks much the same as last year’s iPhone 12 Pro, but internally it’s a different story as it’s here where improvement have been made to the:- Camera- Camera features- Display- Chip/Performance- BatteryCameraThe iPhone 13 Pro has 3 camera lenses, a:1. Wide Camera lens2. Telephoto lens with a x0.5 to x3 optical zoom and a x15 digital zoom.3. Ultra-Wide Camera lens, which for the first time has macro mode:  The ability to take photos or video just 2cm awayCamera featuresThe iPhone 13 Pro has:1. Photographic Styles2. Cinematic modePhotographic Styles are 5 pre-set warmth and tones settings which can be further adjusted if you want.  The pre-sets are ‘Standard’, ‘Rich-Contrast’, ‘Vibrant’, ‘Warm’ and ‘Cool’.Cinematic mode like portrait mode focusses on a subject – either automatically or manually – blurring out the background… and can be refocussed onto another subject if they too come into frame.  The idea is to give a more professional feel to video much like a professional camera, and it is a lot of fun to use, but for more serious camera work it’s not perfect.DisplayAnother new feature to the Pro model is ProMotion.ProMotion is an adaptive display which automatically changes from 10Hz to 120Hz depending on what you’re doing or looking at.  Unfortunately, there are almost no games which can use the 120Hz display but this will change in time… although it is currently noticeable when scrolling quickly between screens or images/text.Chip/PerformanceApple’s new A15 bionic chip is in all the iPhone 13 models.  A 6-core CPU with a 5-core GPU in the Pro models, compared to a 4-core GPU in the regular iPhone 13.  To get straight to the point, the A15 bionic chip is currently the fastest smartphone chip in the world… meaning can comfortably handle the most demanding processes and apps… and still has room to spare!The A15 bionic chip also means Apple will continue support the iPhone 13 range with software (iOS) updates for the next 5-6 years, longer than any other smartphone manufacture.  Meaning it’s ideal for anyone looking to future proof their phone.In addition there is also 6Gb of RAM.BatteryThe battery has been fantastic.  I’m not a heavy phone user, so I’m comfortably getting through the day and often into the next the next day without needing to charge it – although this varies depending on what I’m doing.However, when you look at what the battery is supporting – an improved camera, features, display and a faster chip…. it’s very good.SummaryThe iPhone 13 Pro is an extremely well-engineered phone and what it does, it does well.  If you want or need a telephoto lens, macro mode or the fastest possible smartphone chip out there.  Then get the iPhone 13 Pro.

I decided (Jan 23) that my old iPhone 6s was nearing the end of its life - Apple have decided to stop software updates for it going forward and my concern, now that I use banking apps, was as much about security as anything else. Amazon had £50 off so I bought an iPhone 14 128GB.Amazon delivered it as described - they send you a secure 6 digit code when it's out for delivery to read back to the driver - worked fine.I swapped my old O2 nano sim - non US iPhone 14s as of writing still come with a physical sim slot. Worked immediately. I used the Quick Start wizard to transfer everything from the old phone (had to restart old phone at the start of the process to get it to work). I was pleasantly surprised how well this worked.I won't repeat the many reviews of the phone as they're well documented but immediately I am impressed with its speed, clarity of display, how well Face ID works, the camera, battery life etc.I suspect I will keep it until Apple stop supporting it (7 years??) so very happy.

I’m a big gamer so the fact that games like Genshin work super well on the 14 is a bonus for me. The adjustments from android hasn’t been that hard, but I’m not use to a lot of stuff. This review is going off having a Google pixel not an iPhone before this though so what others are saying about the phone being a iPhone 11 Pro I dunno much about. All I can say it’s better than my old phone with a clearer screen, and I love how it connects to my iPad (important to me as an digital artist.)Battery is amazing, again big gamer so the fact I only charge my phone every two days, In love with. My old phones would be every night and as it got older twice a day without gaming. The colour is a bonus too, love purple.I would go off about price. I’m using Amazon payments, but a lot of companies charge this much for a phone, and SE is best bet if you don’t want your phone to do fancy stuff. I personally wanted good camera , good screen and, gaming. That’s what I’m paying for. :)One thing I’d like is to move my music across without a pc. Haven’t found a way yet, so I just download both google music and iTunes.

Had to get an upgrade from my IPhone 12. Couldn’t be more happier with this phone as of right now. Had it for 3 months now and is still running greatly. The battery life has surprised very much as I have left it in charge for too long on the occasion and it hasn’t effected the max battery charge at all. The 5g is great, camera is fantastic and the systems work to a good standard. Great product
"
6965,B0BDJJKPT2,5,"
I was due an upgrade from my iPhone 10. And after reading reviews I was unsure if to go for this or iPhone 13 Pro. Glad I went for this. Compared to previous versions this phone is quicker. Battery life is better then previous version of iPhone. Camera quality is good. Overall happy with the purchase. It is a bit on the pricey side. I would recommend it.

This is the first time I've ever been up to date with my iPhone. I started with a 6s when the 8 was out and had a XR when the 12 was introduced. At the time of getting the 6s I didn't really have much use for a mobile but I could see they'd become more useful in the years ahead. And now my wife and I used them for almost everything from shopping to ordering our medications, the list goes on. So I wanted an Apple phone that was up to date knowing it would last me, or maybe outlast me, for years. And I love my 14. My grandson said I should have got the pro max and gone for the bigger screen. But this fits in the back pocket of my jeans perfectly. Its also the quickest iPhone I've ever used. So I love it and can heartily recommend it to anyone who, like me doesn't want a fashion statement but a phone that does all you need it to.
"
6969,B0BDJJKPT2,4,"
A great phone with long battery life and fab camera. The only ‘fault’ is that the SOSEmergency alarm went off while I was driving over a bridge which had regular bumps, was curved and in the traffic was driven at quite a speed. The phone was resting in a cup holder and so was shaken so much the alarm went off and we received a phone call to see if the emergency services needed to be called. The alarm itself was so loud it made me jump. So now I make sure the phone is safely held down.  Otherwise it’s a brilliant bit of kit.

Wow I love this Iphone, I upgraded from the iPhone 12 for a few reasons, the iPhone 12 is great but the battery life is not the best but it's much improved on the iPhone 14 and I needed a phone with more storage so went for this and so glad I did, setting this phone up ran so smooth and fast and for some reason apps seem to download so much faster on this phone and my signal seems a lot stronger, everything runs really smooth on the phone and it's just the perfect size for me, it's the perfect phone for me that I highly recommend. Very pleased with my purchase and glad I went and  got it, oh and feels nice to use hold and use aswell, not had it long but so far can't fault anything with it.

Better battery, but it didn’t copy over all my phone contacts. Synced and backed up my old phone prior, but still not there. Rang Apple said could be glitch with latest update. So the only thing is lost my contacts which is a pain as don’t have any names.

Don't believe me? see how similar they are on gsmarena.Notice how the iPhone has barely evolved since the 10?You get the original design, 4 style design, the 6 style design and 10 style design. That’s only 4 design styles over the years.I tested this iPhone and found the camera is shockingly bad especially for closeup pics, gets blurry when my old 6s could’ve taken closeup pics easily and they were sharp.the iPhone 14 'pro' is the true iPhone 14 you could say, the next step in the evolution of these iPhones considering the dynamic island feature. Seriously, what was the point of the iPhone 14? It's more pointless production and needless waste of resources.If they really want to release a phone every year the changes need to be significant. 14 looks the same as 13 and before. Notch improved? That’s not enough to warrant a whole new phone. The innovation is so lazy, slow and conservative.Meanwhile, Samsung are now in folding phones territory where I think the trend should go next.Speaking of releases I don’t think it’s necessary to release a phone every year. A phone is a phone. I was using my 6s this year and still was doing the business for me so it’s pointless and a waste of resources to spew out phones every year. How many more phones are they going to churn out every year when its clear the iPhone series is plateauing? Makes me wonder what the iPhone 57,485,007,327 will look like, lol (I dread to imagine a future like that and how many landfills exist of old discarded phones, rotting and destroying habitats, but i digress).And given the current cost of living crisis, who in their right mind can afford an iPhone these days when many of us in the real world are having to make decisions like heating or eating? Apple say its 'only' 800 quid or whatever (charging British consumers more than the americans), as if thats cheap - mate, i can get a smartphone for less than 100 off ebay that can still do the same stuff the 14 can do - calls, pics, music, internet, youtube. Apple is SO out of touch with reality and what people can really afford.Before you react with your emotional responses - no, I'm not a fan of samsung. Or apple. or sony. or microsoft. or google. or amazon. or facebook. or whatever-big-company-entity you can think of.What's the point of this product?

This is such a disappointment, it’s marginally better than an iPhone 12 and 13.Is it a good phone? Yes, it’s fabulous.Is it worth buying? Absolutely not.Save up for the pro with the newly designed island, excellent new camera and more powerful processor as the basic 14 is pointless. The 14 max maybe an option if you want something bigger but… overall? A completely underwhelming release, and still no usb-c. Come on apple, sort yourselves out, this is the laziest designed iPhone in years.

This is a great phone in almost all respects but coming from a 2016 SE this thing is huge, too wide, too thick. I am over 6 ft with massive paws but find it difficult to use with one hand without the constant risk of dropping it.  I erred for a while whether to get the newest or the 13 mini and assumed as they no longer make the mini it wouldn’t a problem. Well apple, if you are reading this, size matters and after a few weeks I’m slightly regretting my choice.
"
6994,B0BDJJKPT2,2,"
A price hike AND the same processor as last year?! (Yes, I know there is one extra GPU). Thanks, I will pass Apple, and get the 13 when I upgrade.

iPhone 14 and 14 Plus are stripped down iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max's. These are no different than the iPhone 13 from 2021 as the internals are the exact same, all they did was take the A15 Bionic chip out of the 13 Pro/Max and that is literally it. Hence, making it a stripped down, knock-off version of the 13 Pro/Max.iPhone 13 Pro/Max is the better phone and better value for money. It has a 120Hz refresh rate display which makes everything look very smooth and responsive, a much better camera system, better battery life, Stainless Steel build instead of the cheap Aluminium. You have to be a clown to willingly buy the 14 and 14 Plus. iPhone 14 is a rip off version of 13 Pro and 14 Plus is a rip off of 13 Pro Max, while making worse at the same time.Don't waste your money on this trash as it was made to be a quick cash grab from Apple. You'll be able to find a 13 Pro Max 256GB for less than a 14 Plus 256GB.If you don't want the 13 Pro/Max, buy a 13 instead at a discounted price. Just don't be the clown that Apple wants you to be and buy the 14/Plus.BUY THE 13 PRO OR 13 PRO MAX, NOT THIS. DO NOT BUY THE iPHONE 14/14 PLUS

... but at £850+  ?? What's the extra money paying for. I figure, for your basic decent phone, £300 is a rough ballpark. Although I love apple products, typing this on my Mac right now, I don't need to phone someone so bad that I'd pay £850. In fact, I'll just not get this, and won't bother calling anyone. Ever. Thanks, Apple, you turned me into a misanthrope.

The ‌iPhone 14‌'s upgrades over the ‌iPhone 13‌ are questionable. This isn’t an upgrade. It’s literally a repackaged iPhone 13! There are no improvements that make it a worthy purchase. Do yourself a favour. Save £850 by not buying it!
"
7004,B0BDJJKPT2,1,"
Don't. Don't even bother adding the phone to your wish list. Don't even add to cart.The iPhone 14 is literally leftover scraps of the iPhone 13, same specs same everything -Hey, who even wants a 7 inch screen? You might aswell get an iPad or Laptop if you're planning to get a phone BIGGER THAN YOUR HEAD. Period. Don't. The most wasteful £1,000 you can ever spend. Just get an iPhone 13 or below - the safety features even require a subscription? - I am NOT going to pay for a life or death situation, thanks.Please, save yourself and just get a different phone. This is Apple's biggest fail.

Je suis passe du samsung S22 Ultra que je trouvais trop grand et lourd en main a iphone 14 et je suis très content, oui je sais vous allez dire passer de android à Apple c’est juste pas possible mais détrompez vous moi par exemple en même pas 1 semaine je me suis fait et en venant de android depuis plus de 15 ans donc…niveau batterie je tiens 24h en passant plusieurs heures sur tiktok navigation internet spotify etc et j’ai remarqué un réel gain de plusieurs heures niveau batterie comparé au Samsung S22 ultra aussi en 60hz. J’ai une moyenne de 9h écran allumée en 24h Apple c’est beaucoup amélioré niveau autonomie j’en suis très content je le recommande a 1000%, il est ni petit ni grand juste parfait, charge via câble 1h40 ok vous allez dire c’est long il y a mieux mais voila je tiens 24h et il me reste minimum 20% de batterie donc je suis tranquille. J’espère avoir aidé car moi j’ai beaucoup hésité venant de android mais j’en suis vraiment pas déçu j’en suis même très très content voila voila

Die Kritik, dass sich so wenig zum Vorgänger getan hat kann ich nicht so ganz nachvollziehen. Ich kaufe mir doch auch kein neues Auto, wenn es Facelift ansteht, sondern warte auf den direkten Nachfolger. Das iPhone 14 ist Modellpflege vom 12er und 13er was man auch direkt am Aussehen erkennen kann. Ich bin vom 11er auf das 14er gesprungen und merke schon deutliche Unterschiede.+ super Verarbeitung+ edles Design ohne spürbare Kanten oder Spalte+ Display ist sehr gut verarbeitet und hell+ das iOS. Das Herzstück wie immer DER Kaufgrund für ein iPhone. Ich habe neben diverser Apple Geräte so ziemlich alle Betriebsysteme der letzten Jahre und Hersteller durch. Daher will ich auch keine Grundsatzdiskussion vom Zaun brechen. Für mich ist Apples System die Speerspitze.  Wenn man nun noch mehrere Geräte aus dem Apple Universum benutzt steigert sich das Ganze sogar noch und man hat ein Biotop was genialer nicht sein kann.+ Kamera und die neuen Videofunktionen sind sehr gut. Wer hier kritisiert, dass Apple keine 60 oder 120MP hat dem sei gesagt: Schaut euch die BIlder im Vergleich an. Mehr Pixel heißt nicht besser! Aber mit irgendetwas muss man ja punkten, wenn es schon nicht das Betriebsystem ist+ der Transfer der Daten vom alten Telefon zum neuen Gerät. Wie immer simpel, schnell und genial einfach- Preis

Dieses Gerät ist für Leute, die ein sehr sehr hochwertiges Handy haben wollen genau das richtige. Das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis ist zwar fraglich, aber man bekommt eben ein extrem hochwertiges Gerät. Für ältere Personen ist dieses Smartphone eher gewöhnungsbedürftig und nicht zu empfehlen, da die Bedienung über wischen und streichen erfolgt. Für Leute, die jedoch damit gut umgehen können, ist das Handy perfekt. Auch die Kamera geht fast nicht besser. Alles in allem ein perfektes Produkt zu einem etwas teuren Preis, aber wer Apple kauft und damit ein sehr hochwertiges Gerät bekommen möchte, muss eben auch mit so einem Preis leben.

Bin vom 12er auf das iPhone 14 in Product-Red umgestiegen weil ich für  mich persönlich einen - wenn auch geringen - Mehrwert gesehen habe, der mir die 999 Euro einfach wert war. Allein schon die Verdoppelung des Einstiges-Speicherplatzes von immer knappen 64 auf für mich üppige 128 GB war mir den Aufpreis wert. Auch die wesentlich verbesserte Reparaturfreundlichkeit (bin diesbezüglich leider ein gebranntes Kind) ist sehr schön, da sich die Glas-Rückwand nun einzeln und rel. günstig austauschen lässt. Das geht bei den teuren Pro-Modellen leider nicht! Erstaunt war ich auch, wie gut ich mein altes iPhone 12 noch verkaufen konnte - das ist für mich ein grundsätzlicher und nicht zu unterschätzender Vorteil der Apple-Handys. Von mir deshalb volle 5 Sterne!

Nach über 20 Jahre Android, auf Empfehlung umgestiegen auf IPhone 14, das war aber dann doch nicht das gelbe vom Ei!alles nicht so Optimal wie man das gewohnt ist, kein Fingerscann dafür Gesichtserkennung aber nur für eine Person was sehr schlecht ist.Die meisten App von Android gibt es auch im Apple Store allerdings bei Android Kostenlos bei Apple  nur ein paar Tage zum Testen dann muss man Zahlen.Bedienung sehr Kompliziert, man kommt sich vor wie bei einer Putzkolonne wischen schieben, es fehlt das waschen!Ladebuchse immer noch Apple eigen, man hat noch nichts gehört von USB C, habe ich bei meinem Android schon seid 3 Jahren.Und nun soll man dafür soviel Geld bezahlen  für was, für den Glauben es wäre etwas besseres, nein Danke.Ist schon auf dem Wege zurück!!!

Ist ja bei Apple nichts neues aber hier merkt man wirklich null Unterschied zu älteren Modellen. Habe nachdem mein 12er kaputt gegangen ist das hier gekauft und es ist schon ziemlich dreist: man merkt wirklich Null Unterschied in der Handhabung und die Kamera ist auch nicht bemerkbar besser. Ganz im Gegenteil sogar, mit dem neuen ios habe ich viel mehr bugs und Aufhänger, dee Akku scheint auch kürzer zu halten. Im großen und ganzen ist es ein super Handy (ios>android), wenn man so viel Geld für ein Hand ausgeben will ok, ich würde aber eher ein älteres Modell kaufen.

The phone was in perfect condition! Really something to change your opinion on refurbished devices.I was particularly fond of the packaging! Thought was clearly put into waste and the came with a charging cable and plug (not original, but no way a problem at all).The battery ‘health’ was at 100% which was incredible to see, so not sure if this was changed, or whether the phone was very new (certainly looked it).FaceRecognition wise I have yet to try, will update if any issues! (Thought I very much doubt it with the way it came).Only problem, is I’d knock £100-200 off the price, because, well, why not ;) , but in all seriousness, perfect condition and happy so far!
"
7088,B09MGHJS6P,4,"
A good seller who replies within 1 day.Phones are in quite good condition. Packaging can be improved. Price is very decent. The devices should be cleaned better before they get dispatched to the customers.I got 1 x iphone 13 pro max 256gb ""excellent"" condition which was excellent indeed. 94% battery but I had to spend some time cleaning the edges and cameras of the phone from dirt.I also ordered 1 x iphone 13 pro 256gb accidentally ""excellent condition"". This was not a real excellent since it came with lots of scratches on the screen. the battery life was 99% though.Overall, I recommend the seller since you're backed up by Amazon. He communicates well and he listens to his customers
"
7089,B09MGHJS6P,4,"
The phone arrived with no damage to the outside which is to be expected as I ordered it in “excellent condition” it seems to be working well no problems noticed yet, only had it for over a week, battery life was 91% which is what disappointed me the most as I would expect higher for this condition.
"
7090,B09MGHJS6P,5,"
Looks like new, works like new. Genuinely can’t see a single scratch. Battery life is still at 97% which is grand. Arrived early, cameras and Face ID all work. Screen is likely the original as True Tone still works. You just need to have a paper clip handy to get the sim tray open because it doesn’t come with the original packaging (pretty standard for refurbished phones in my experience). Great phone, should last well!

The phone is literally like a brand new phone. There is 1 tiny scratch on the screen which you cannot notice unless you try to look for it and the battery life is fantastic.

I was waiting so long for the IPhone 14 IMax Pro to come in stock which was a result of the China Covid lockdown so I decided to go for the 13 Max Pro  reconditioned model and I wasn’t disappointed. Perfect condition, not one scratch. Battery life excellent.

The guarantee is just for 5 months and the battery life is 97% , it should be 100%. I’m not very well with that

I had this phone for nearly a month and most of my friends were complaining about sound quality . I actually thought that they might not have good signal because of the wind , but it was poorly for Wi-Fi too. Kind of feeling bad for blaming their devices for the fault.It is cutting through phrases and freeze on video call. FaceTime is glitching and it is not from iOS because I have another 12 pro max which has no issues.I requested to return the item, but this is a small inconvenience. The rest of the phone is great, but if you can’t talk to the phone it is a BIG issue.

I have upgraded my iPhone 11 Pro Max to the 13 Pro Max.If you’re debating going for the new 14 Plus, I would instead look into purchasing a renewed 13 Pro Max. Not only do both phones have most of the same features, the 13 Pro Max also has ProMotion 120hz display which is an extremely noticeable difference moving from the 11 Pro Max.People will most certainly have different experiences buying a renewed phone, however I received mine in almost pristine condition (only a slight hair line scratch at the bottom of the screen, only visible in certain angles), the battery is at 99% health which is basically a new phone.All in all I would recommend going for a renewed phone if you’re looking so save the extra £££ and still receive the latest features.

Iphones hot spot is complete and utter garbage and I'm not the only one that's noticed. I used to use my 10yr old Samsung S8s hotspot for everything. It wasn't even 5g enabled. It was consistent, devices connected automatically and there was no problems. After switching to iPhone I never thought I'd be stepping back 15 yrs. I now effectively do not have a hot spot. Devices do not connect automatically (Even my Mac which connects without fail to my old android) if devices do connect they regularly disconnect and or just stop working. I had never seen the exclamation mark symbol on the wifi status bar on Mac until I regrettably switched to iPhone. iPhone doesn't even let you go in and see what is connected to the hot spot either, you just have to guess. The way you have to make the hotspot discoverable is ridiculous too, you need to leave it on the settings screen, but if you're using an app like trying to get an Alexa or a smart watch connected you have to come off it, so its no longer discoverable. I had to use my android to connect my Alexa to my iPhone. Just ridiculous, no option to make hot spot permanently discoverable but I suppose it's neither here nor there because it often doesn't work anyway! I write this review on my Mac with my iPhone plugged in via USB and wifi off because surprise surprise, the hot spot isn't working. Please note I've wasted countless hours on resetting network settings and trying this that and the other thing. The problem is it's an iPhone and iPhones have absolutely garbage connectivity and no amount of resetting or changing settings will change that. There is countless online threads on iPhones non existent hotspot, some of which go back years. it's 2023 and iPhone still acts like it's 2004 and tethering doesn't yet exist. Will be changing back to android asap

I purchased the refurbished iphone 13 pro max, and i cannot lie, i could not point out a single flaw. The camera and smoothness of the phone was amazing.Sadly, I felt like there was too big of a change switching from android as there are many apps not supported on ios, so i decided to return it, and there was no issues returning at all.I definitely reccomend purchasing from this seller!

I have upgraded from iPhone 12 Pro and what a difference!+ 120Hz ProMotion display is buttery smooth and superb;+ battery life is exceptional (lasts all day easily with a very heavy use!);+ A15 is a power monster of a processor and nothing can hold it back;+ 6GB of RAM is more than enough and iOS runs like a rocket;+ very premium feel and perfect finish, which as always is expected from Apple;My main 2 reason for upgrading was superb battery life (compared to 12 Pro)and 120Hz high refresh rate display. Those 2 reasons are big enough reasonsand massive improvements that a phone is worth upgrading to!

I initially was going to return the phone as there was a very visible scratch on the screen. I changed my mind as it is a reconditioned phone. I purchased a screen protector and all at the moment is good. The phone itself is easy to use and a little bigger than I am used to but I am pleased.

The phone all around was in great condition and was totally worth the purchase! However if you are a *perfectionist* or whatever, they do come with little imperfections like mine came with little scratches on the corner and sides however with a car on there is no visible damage at all! The battery life is good about a whole day of battery if not used Al day. The only little thing that I can say is bad about my renewed phone is that when I try to play voice messages to my ear it turns the screen black and I have no idea why but it’s barely a big fault! If anyone is wondering whether to get one just ask yourself if your willing to save £200+ for some minor scratches?
"
7158,B08PCD292R,4,"
Product arrived in a simple wrap around die cut package, so I was extra careful to inspect for any transit damage, I need not have been concerned the very basic package did its job.First impression was very favourable as I could find no marks, issues, or signs of wear until upon very close inspection I found a tiny small scratch on the top right had side of the screen. The scratch is less than 2 mm in length, does not appear to be 'deep' can only be seen when the screen is off, when on it cannot be seen at all.The battery capacity is showing 90%. However, I have a concern over VFM, I felt at the time it was overpriced. And now seeing that Amazon have reduced the price by a considerable amount after less than ten days, I am even more convinced over VFM, heart over head methinks!My overall 'score' reflects the price paid. However, I am satisfied with the device, it looks new, seems to be 'fit for purpose' and is far superior to my last mobile.I am most certainly looking forward to many years of trouble free usage.

I'm actually really impressed. We paid £453 for an iPhone 12 pro. It came in a standard non branded box, with charger, SIM tool and warranty card. The phone was wrapped in bubble wrap and honestly, looks new. There was some very very minor marks on the sides but literally, they were covered as soon as you picked up by fingerprints, so you wouldn't notice. Everything functions perfectly, face recognition works great. Battery life was 87 percent, which for a 2 year old phone I thought was amazing. I'm so glad we gambled and saved ourselves a couple of hundred pounds. We borrowed an actual box from a friend and gave it to our daughter as a Christmas present, she is in love with it and hasn't asked if it's second hand so clearly hasn't noticed! Amazing, amazing.There was only one downside and that was from Amazon themselves and not the seller. They'd left the package outside in the rain, so it could've easily been stollen or soaked through which would've been a nightmare!

I bought an Iphone 12 pro 128gb 2 weeks ago in 'excellent' condition for £499. I was doubtful It would arrive in the flawless condition they claim but I took a risk. Anyway when it arrived I noticed all 4 corner metal edges of the phone were very slightly damaged (noticeable it had been dropped by the previous owner) but with a basic case on the phone looked brand new. The screen, camera and back of the phone were actually flawless. The battery arrived with 85% life which feels so much longer lasting than the 86% battery life of my XR prior so cant complain. I saved close to £400 and this will be the way I will be buying my future phones DEFO worth the money.

7161,B08PCD292R,5,"
Placed the order for my iPhone 12 Pro in ""Acceptable condition (refurbished)"" on Friday 6th January and received the item the following day. The phone was as descrcibed, only having minor scratches on the screen. The camera lens and the rear of the phone were in good condition with no visible scratches. Lastly, the battery was displaying 88% capacity so all-in-all i am very happy with my purchase. Would definitely recommend!

Great product and arrived on time however the battery life was on 86% which is quite low but I will get it replaced

7163,B08PCD292R,5,"
I was sceptical at first, obviously, it was so cheap for something like new. When it came in it’s packaging, I was worried because it looked trash, but once I got it out, started setting it all up… I’m completely convinced I’ve struck gold. Not to be dramatic but I will be buying all my devices here, delivery was also way quicker than it was estimated! I ordered on the 9th, got it on the 12th, and their warranty is true to its word, I had a false alarm and they were completely down to fix it but all it needed was a force restart, lol 👍🏽
"
7164,B08PCD292R,5,"
The phone is absolutely in perfect condition! No scratches at all. It seems new. The only thing is the battery which as 84% of capacity is not lasting very much but for the price I’ve got it it’s really worth it!

We purchased the ‘excellent’ condition however it had a gaping scratch on the front and other nicks throughout the screen. This was purchased through Stock Must Go via Amazon. The rest of the phone was in pretty good condition annoyingly as I would of preferred it the other way round. Battery health was at 83% so at the lower end.The company did offer to refund/exchange.

There is no way of knowing what you’ll get, be warned!!!Unfortunately I had to return the phone and in doing so, PAID FOR RETURN P&PI returned it because the phone only had 92% batt health when I received it and it went down 1% within 2 days of using itTo me, this was catastrophicI used it for a week but I just couldn’t get over the low batt healthFor £615 I was expecting basically unusedI also did some research (after buying this, doh) and found out that iOS 14 KILLED the 12 Pro battery when it was released and I suspect that the phone I received suffered badly because of thisIn terms of condition- the phone was 99% mint, just 3-4 dot-sized nicks out of the chrome edging but no dents or scratches whatsoeverAmazon and MusicMagpie combined were perfect where the return was concerned but I was pretty narked to pay return p&p

For a great many years I have managed to avoid buying an iPhone for myself.Finally, I took the plunge buying refurbished to try it out and save some money whilst also helping the environment. I do not regret my purchase whatsoever and have been a happy bunny. However, the only single down side is the battery life is not what was expected but I’m still charging it once per day as usual anyway, so I can live with that.

I bought this to replace my iPhone XS. As the battery was bad and needed to improve the tech.  But this arrived with only 83% battery health. So I sent it back. It clearly stated it would be much more than this too.  So not great.

7193,B08PCD292R,4,"
The phone came in with 92% battery life and no visible marks which is a good sign and one that really matters. However the packaging was absolutely horrible, and I want to stress that it looked as if packaging was done for wood stick. In addition the charger provided with the phone is a really low quality one.

So after my first attempt to get a refurbished phone, where the phone was in an excellent condition.  I had to return that one and try again.  So I ordered exactly the same phone again, only to find that the phone wasn't in 'Excellent' condition as described on the website.  There were so many scratches around the edges of the phone, although the screen appeared to be in excellent condition, I would have put this in 'Good' or possibly 'OK' condition.  So after my first experience where the SIM card didn't register, I checked that first and it was fine.  So just to be safe I did some more checks the mag charger worked, but the cable charger didn't work.  What does this company actually check before it sends the phone out?  These are basic checks and to say 'Excellent' condition is a joke.  So now after returning 2 iphones I'm still waiting for a refund of £1008.45 for both phones.  Not a great experience.

I purchased this iPhone for my daughters 18th birthday, so it was important for me  to have a phone that looked new. I read the description of a phone rated “excellent condition” and it says screen - no scratches, body - no scratches or dents. Please look at the photos of what I received!! There is a crack in the corner and the screen was covered in scratches, the previous owner clearly hadn’t used a screen protector as my very old iphone 6’s screen is in much better condition. Amazon also had to help me out as the seller doesn’t pay for returns so I have had to pay for the return myself and send a photo of my receipt to Amazon who will refund postage for me. The refund for the phone will take 5-7 days so it means I won’t have my refund quick enough to source another one in time for my daughters birthday. It’s been a bit of a nightmare! The seller needs to be honest with their description as it causes a lot of disappointment and hassle otherwise.

The phone is in very good condition, has no scratches or chips at all.I was worried due to some of the other reviews.The battery health is at 86% which is fine for a phone that has potentially been used for a year or so already.

Still appalling value for money, even second hand, they cost mere pounds to make in volume. Price does not reflect intrinsic value, rather what consumers are prepared to pay, and these days they are prepared to pay what Apple tell them to pay. Economics of capitalism. Go research.Cameras are below market average, whatever the reassuring advertising says, it's just words. All the grand images and videos Apple show in their hype ads are created through software rendering. You can get results like these, and better, from any image source using any editing software, even the free ones. Won't be using these for my professional photographic needs, got a 108 megapixel snapper on another brand for that, the difference really does show.Pleased with handset, perfect except for one small mark on bezel. Battery appears okay, but then the phone is only a year old. Some older models I've recently bought (7 and 8 series) needed replacements (easy to do yourself).Will be used as an iPod, not a phone, iTunes is only music player that plays back mix albums without those tiny gaps between tracks, one thing Apple have always got right. On downside, playlists can occasionally cause problems, some won't switch off and can only be deleted via PC, others cause track title/band display errors, especially with mp3s not bought through Apple, but this is a minor niggle, gaplesss playback is why I bought this, that's probably Apple's crowning achievement. When you've gone Android for your phone needs, you don't go back.Had to buy the 256 GB model, not the 128, because iOS generates a permanent massive ""cache"" file in use, up to 10gb, which means this chunk of memory storage can't be used for user files, it's a niggle that's been on iPhones since early days and Apple haven't rectified it, probably think they don't need to, blame it on their customers as usual. It used to be part of the ""system files"" when you check storage use in general settings, now it has its own entry, so at least now you can check how much of your phone's memory storage is unavailable. It's a huge chunk.Lastly, don't buy from Loop Mobile, they aren't nice people to deal with and won't accept you cancelling an order one even if it is only an hour after placing

I was initially unsure about buying a ‘renewed’ iPhone 12 from Amazon and the vendor, Phones Direct uk only had a few ratings but all 100% positive. I went for it and couldn’t be happier (and relived) when it arrived. Quick delivery, well packaged and the phone looked brand new other than not having the protective film on the screen. As it was a ‘renewed’ product I probably spent extra time trying my hardest to find imperfections, tiny scratches etc but couldn’t find a thing, perfect condition. Not sure the plug and charging cable are original but they work as well as my existing apple cable and plug. The quick start guide included is a Phones Direct uk guide rather than an apple one but it was all I needed (the phone does it all for you). Been using the phone for a while and all working as expected. It comes with a 12 month Amazon renewed warranty so still have the same piece of mind as a new phone. Based on my experience, I would buy a renewed product from Phones Direct Uk again.

No marks anywhere, no scratches, battery health 96%. Brilliant.
"
7207,B08PCD292R,2,"
Disappointed that the screen was not in good condition
"
7208,B08PCD292R,5,"
Excellent condition and works perfectly.
"
7209,B08PCD292R,5,"
The phone is great condition. Some scratch on the side. The screen is good though, everything works in perfect

Ordered this phone because I tried repairing my phone myself, and it went horribly wrong.. so came onto Amazon and came across this product. I was a bit reluctant because I’ve never ordered a renewed phone, but there was no difference compared to a brand new iphone! No scratches, no damages, and a lot cheaper than ordering a brand new one. Everything works great! It even came with a charger and a plug whereas a brand new iPhone 12 Pro doesn’t come with a plug. Would highly recommend this!

Originally bought this as a mistake instead of Pro Max, immediately contacted seller after buying it but they didn’t respond and sent the item anyway. I decided to keep it as I needed a phone ASAP. 2 weeks in and the battery only lasts a few hours, and now the Face ID isn’t working properly. Seller still won’t respond.
"
7213,B08PCD292R,3,"
Just didn’t came with charger, no headsets and battery was well used
"
7214,B08PCD292R,5,"
Very clean iPhone , zero scratch
"
7215,B08PCD292R,4,"
I have open box 86% cap battery. It’s draining so quick like 3 to 4 hours. Otherwise phone looks and feels brand new. No scratches. Loved it.
"
7216,B08PCD292R,5,"
Bought a present for my friend, he was very happy many thanks
"
7217,B08PCD292R,5,"
The phone arrived next day very well packaged and it was all that I thought it would be. Not a mark on it, in excellent condition and very simple to transfer from my old iPhoneI’ve saved over £300 and am very happy
"
7218,B08PCD292R,5,"
Iphone 12 Pro came in excellent condition, no scratches, battery is at 89% health. I have no complaints and would definitely buy again from this seller. Delivery made as promised, not in original package, but safe and secure nonetheless. Came with brand new USB to Lightning cable.
"
7219,B08PCD292R,3,"
Battery 89,acceptable.But there are scratches which cannot be ignored on the screen and the back,contacted the seller several times and didn’t get the reply.It’s worth the price but it looks absolutely not new.Whatever,it will have the scratches in several weeks after all,and the price was low.这价格还要啥自行车 哈哈哈哈哈
"
7220,B08PCD292R,5,"
I was worried about buying a refurbished phone  but took the gamble. It came in two days signed delivery in a non descript white box. The phone was in a sealable bag, with a charging cable (no headphones or plug). The phone was immaculate in every way. The battery life was 89% but must be expected considering the discount in price.I’ve had my IPhone 12 Pro over a month now with no issues or problems. Highly recommend.
"
7221,B08PCD292R,5,"
Good 👍
"
7222,B08PCD292R,5,"
iPhone like new in great condition not a scratch or mark on screen or body. Works perfectly had no problems in setting it up and importing settings from my old iPhone 7. Was a bit worried about face recognition but easy to set up and no probs in use. Camera takes good clear pics. Battery life is good fantastic in comparison to old phone. To sum up very pleased with my purchase.
"
7223,B08PCD292R,5,"
So I was really reluctant spending a lot of money on a second hand phone, but safe to say I’m very relieved and actually really happy. I’d say if 100% was a brand new phone, I would say 95%. The tiniest of mark on the screen and that’s it. Which I expected more than that with it being second hand!! And battery health is 94%. Again, what I’d expect with it being second hand. So overall, very pleased and luckily for me worth the risk.
"
7224,B08PCD292R,5,"
Scratch free, excellent battery, and half the price. For a year old phone!
"
7225,B08PCD292R,5,"
The phone arrived in a foam padded box, with sim tool and charger. The battery health is 100% out of the box and is in pristine condition. There are no surface imperfections whatsoever.The phone functions as if new including facial recognition and cameras.Great value for money. Would recommend.
"
7226,B08PCD292R,1,"
Purchased an 'exceptional' condition phone only to received a phone with scratched screen. Condition would be 'accetable' at best. The seller had fitted a screen cover to try and hide. Poor form!

I was hoping that all the bad review of loop mobile were just some angry client, instead I’ve to say that they were absolutely true LOOP MOBILE let me down big times I bought this iPhone 12 Pro that should have been renewed, when instead The description of the product is completely false, was stating that should be an item that is renewed, when instead the item is just used, not even cleaned, it came with the lcd all scratched, not any kind of protection on top, I wasn’t expecting a protection glass on top but at the very least a kind of film on top of the lcd, the phone was all dirty, and the scratches visible from more than not just 30cm you can see them with your eyes closed, customer service very poor, I had to go through amazon customer service to have any kind of help, and even there just a refund, I needed the phone not something that I’ve to send back and revive the money after another week, absolutely unhappy, be careful to do not order fromLoop mobile if you getting a renewed phone, but get it from the other seller, that instead has very very good reviews, do not make my same error guys…!
"
7229,B08PCD292R,5,"
When I ordered this iPhone I wasn’t too sure because of some of the few negative reviews. However the iPhone came in an excellent condition. Almost looked new. Only one minor hardly visible scratch. Functioning like new. Very pleased with it.
"
7230,B08PCD292R,1,"
I ordered this and only the charger and the sim came with it. They’re saying I’m not eligible for a refund. What the hell? I’ve been saving up for this and this happens this is why i do not order cheap stuff do not order from here save your money somewhere else.
"
7231,B08PCD292R,5,"
Arrived as expected, perfect condition, happy shopper
"
7232,B08PCD292R,5,"
The first one I received has some scratches on the screen so I return it. The second one (different seller) is spotless, perfect conditions, 2 small scratches on the frame but not impacting screen. Battery life 87%. Really worth the money.
"
7233,B08PCD292R,5,"
As with a lot of people I was a bit unsure about buying a refurbished phone, especially when you don't know how it's going to arrive, however I have to say I'm nothing but impressed!No noticeable cosmetic damage, battery health at 99%, it may as well have come factory fresh at this point! Would definitely recommend, especially given the price.
"
7234,B08PCD292R,5,"
The phone came with a charger, it looked like bland new - no scratches or sign of being used. The battery life is 90% percent , which is great for the money ! Would recommend
"
7235,B08PCD292R,1,"
Screen was obviously replaced but practically useless. Surprised sent out in this condition.  I paid for Excellent condition. Awaiting refund.

7237,B08PCD292R,5,"
Phone was as accepted. Good condition good battery life. Was happy with the purchase
"
7238,B08PCD292R,5,"
Couldn’t be happier, looks like new apart from the tiniest blemish on the frame which is covered by a case anyway. Screen is completely blemish free and although it comes with an Amazon 12 month warranty the Apple warranty runs until April 2022.
"
7239,B08PCD292R,5,"
Absolutely delighted with it can’t tell it from a new one works perfectly
"

I have to say, I'm very happy with this iphone, it's like new,  10/10
"
7241,B08PCD292R,5,"
Bought as a “renewed” phone but it looks brand new, took me ages to spot a minute mark on the edge, came with a fast charger and lead with free 24 hour delivery, why pay full price for a new one.
"
7242,B08PCD292R,5,"
Good value for money, battery life only goes up to 91%, but manageable, everything else works perfectly well, good investment
"
7243,B08PCD292R,5,"
You wouldn’t know that this phone is used at all. There’s not a single scratch on it, works really well. The only way I know this is used is that the battery health is 94% - but I’m still really happy and would definitely buy a refurbished phone again.
"
7244,B08PCD292R,5,"
Great value for money. Reconditioned phone arrived ahead of time. Phone looks perfect. Transfer from old iPhone was extremely easy.  I saved a lot of money as against buying a brand new 13 & this does everything for me. Great service from this seller.
"
7245,B08PCD292R,5,"
Was a wee bit apprehensive about purchasing a renewed phone but glad I did. The warranty gives you peace of mind too. My phone came with 96% battery health and a week or so left on apple’s warranty. Genuinely couldn’t find any scratches or anything on the phone. Thanks!
"
7246,B08PCD292R,5,"
I couldn’t take a picture of the phone because I’m using it currently. But this product is definitely very awesome. No issues. And it’s very clean
"
7247,B08PCD292R,5,"
Quick delivery, phone had no visible scratches , everything works fine , 91% battery health. It’s a very good quality item for the price.
"
7248,B08PCD292R,5,"
Wow I was SO nervous to buy refurbished, yet I wanted an iphone 12 pro so much, so I took the plunge and I don't regret it. Battery life was 100% (literally), any scratch of faulty bottom, it was impeccable. I couldn't be happier.

7256,B08PCD292R,5,"
The quality of the phone is as though it is STRAIGHT from the factory. No scratches, no marks. Batteryfor me was 95%. If you want to save money and not waste £1000 on the same phone then order from here.
"
7257,B08PCD292R,1,"
The worst seller I have dealt with when it comes to warranty and repairs. I have brought a phone which has 1 year warranty. This seller messed me about so much and never fixed it. I sent it to them 2 times at my own cost. They’re a waste of time and the communication is so poor. It’s like talking to a brick wall and it’ll get you nowhere. Never again will I use them. Avoid at all costs.

7258,B08PCD292R,5,"
Excellent product. Very happy

Worthy to buy specially from Amazon website.
"
7268,B08PCD292R,2,"
It says on the description that you won’t be able to see any damage from 30cm away - this is not true! This phone had lots of scratches and chips that were easily visible from over 30cm away. Got a refund and bought from Apple direct!

Nice colour. Photos are brilliant great apps.

7279,B08PCD292R,1,"
The phone provide by Loop-Mobile, I have received is at best described as fair/good standard. It works fine but the cosmetics are damaged on the upper areas of the metal body all around the phone. The phone also arrived dirty, especially around speaker at the bottom of the phone and around volume controls and the camera lens. All easily cleanable but you’d expect the phone to arrive clean if been through their quality control as described. I have requested a refund. I would add that you should check which company you are ordering from as they don’t all come from same one and I’m sure others will be fine.
"
7280,B08PCD292R,1,"

7282,B08PCD292R,1,"
The first phone sent had a major hardware problem as confirmed by diagnostics at an Apple Store. i thought that was just bad luck so did a return and ordered another. that arrived from a different supplier with a screen with scratch so obvious a blind person could have felt it. Just want off and bought a new phone after this. Less hassle.

Ordered a Renewed iPhone 12 Pro 256GB - when it arrived the screen was covered in scratches and was not in a like-new condition.The device was fully working but when you order a like-new phone you do not expect multiple scratches on the screen.

Not as it’s made out. Scratches around the side of the phone. Really disappointed. Waiting to get this resolved. Not as described- I know it’s refurbishes but it definitely not worth it

They sell the item saying that “it looks and works as new” but the screen is full of visible scratches. Also, there is a little dent on one of the corners.

This phone was received in excellent condition. Looks absolutely new. Had it for ten days now and so happy with this purchase so far. Very long battery life and extremely suitable for my needs.
"
7298,B08PCD292R,5,"
The only flaw is that the battery (although I knew that refurbished ones don't have 100% working battery) sometimes gets discharged earlier and earlier. I bought it two months ago and at the beginning it was perfect, now I feel that the battery is struggling to recharge.Otherwise, perfect... like new!
"
7299,B08PCD292R,3,"

7307,B08PCD292R,5,"
The phone is in mint condition, no issues whatsoever, not even a tiny scratch. I have got the gold one, 128GB for a very good price and it was delivered in a couple of days The box is not Apple original, nor is the charger, but its no big deal considering is not brand new. Would definitely recommend this buy.

It’s a good product delivery service is very discreet, so I am pleased with it
"
7314,B08PCD292R,5,"
To be honest, I was a little sceptical about purchasing a phone that appeared to be around 1/3 it's retail price. I've heard the horror stories about people opening their non-Apple certified gadgets and witnessing them crash and burn before their own eyes.The reviews where largely hit or miss, seemed like almost a gamble. You could either end up with a superior find, with beautiful customer servicing - or you could end up with some cranky leftover that isn't worth pennies and peanuts, from a foreign guy over the phone who refuses to give your money back.I'm happy to say that I belong to the former. Upon receiving the phone I find that it works just as intended. No (noticeable) cosmetic or functional damage, no problem switching my SIM card over, and while the battery capacity (86%) isn't exactly something to obsess over, the actual experience of using and charging it feels as if it just came fresh out the Apple Store.  Would definitely recommend this seller and this phone, especially for its price vs retail. However, mind you, make sure you purchase one that's in Excellent condition - I cannot reprimand or tell you about products of a lower grade, and nor can you expect much if it arrives as broken as a lot of these reviewers learnt the hard way. On that end, be sure to know your options if such happens.
"
7315,B08PCD292R,5,"
I was more concern over ordering renewed product wether it will be an original or will have no warranty, because of Amazon backed 1 year warranty I chose to go ahead. I received a phone in prestine condition (just as new), no wear and tear no scratches just as new. No one can differentiate wether it's a new or renewed. I got 10 months apple warranty remaining on the product. I got mobile in custom box not the apple branded. In the box I got mobile phone, charging cable, No charger included.I am using the phone and have faced no issues at all.
"
7316,B08PCD292R,5,"
I couldn’t be happier with my renewed iPhone. It’s the first time I have bought renewed and I’m  really impressed: phone looks and operates as brand new, at a fraction of the price. Reuse upgrade is better for the planet too. Max battery capacity reads as 95% but can easily last 48hrs with my usage. Delivered on time in quality protective packaging.
"
7317,B08PCD292R,5,"
IPhone 12 works fine as advertised
"
7318,B08PCD292R,5,"
The phone arrived super quickly. It is in a great condition (super minor scratches can be seen only if you look very closely). It works perfectly well, the battery has 93% of capacity.Overall I am very pleased with my purchase.

7319,B08PCD292R,5,"
My iPhone X was giving up on me so I thought it was time for an upgrade. This phone is amazing, loads of new features and looks great too. Would recommend
"
7320,B08PCD292R,4,"
There is a lot of dust and dirt on the handset and charging port of the mobile phone. I used a brush to clean them up carefully, and the battery is a little old, which is normal and acceptable. After all, this is a second-hand product, and other aspects are still okay.
"
7321,B08PCD292R,5,"
Packaging for the two iphones was very disappointing. both phones wrapped together in bubble wrap and in a flimsy carton which was not much bigger than the phones. However, the phones themselves were in great condition with no visible damage. About 6 weeks since purchase and all going well.

iPhone è arrivato in condizioni eccellenti sono soddisfatto La batteria e perfetta e le condizioni del cellulari veramente eccellenti. Posso dire come nuovo.
"
7324,B08PCD292R,4,"
Arrivato con un giorno di anticipo, il cellulare è esteticamente e funzionalmente perfetto, nessun graffio nè altri segni di uso neanche cercando con una lente d'ingrandimento. Non mi è piaciuta la confezione per via della protezione morbida che perdeva pelucchi e c'è voluto tempo prima di pulirlo bene per applicare il vetro protettivo (comprato a parte). La vera pecca però è la batteria il cui stato è 84% quindi prossima alla sostituzione.
"
7325,B08PCD292R,4,"
Sono molto contentx, grazie. Il materiale è molto moderno e anche il design. Sono passato da Android a Apple e posso dire che ne sono contento. Il passaggio era un po‘ faticoso ma è andato tutto a buon fine e anche la spedizione era molto veloce👍
"

Funzionalità perfetta. Batteria perfetta. Schermo intatto. Piccole tacche da probabile caduta sul margine della cornice (più di una). Tolgo quindi una stella perché non lo considero di prima scelta ma di condizioni accettabili. Mi va bene così ma non sono stato avvertito prima. Imballo inesistente scatolina di cartone in busta gialla pluriboll.  Consegna senza dover firmare.

Arrivato prima del previsto il telefono è esteticamente in condizioni eccellenti, come da descrizione, peccato che la batteria invece è all’87%, mi sarei aspettato una percentuale almeno sopra il 90%.

Ho acquistato iPhone 12 pro in stato eccellente…telefono arrivato perfetto pari a nuovo non si direbbe che è un ricondizionato …L unica pecca è la batteria con vita all 83%..x essere pari a nuovo è un po’ poca xo posso dire che è attiva la applecare plus ancora in garanzia..per quanto riguarda il corriere è arrivato con due giorni di anticipo rispetto alla data indicata …ho richiesto la fattura e in meno di due ore mi è stata inviata tramite mail…lo comsiglio

Ho comprato il dispositivo in “condizioni eccellenti” e sinceramente non mi aspettavo tanti segni di usura come quelli che ho trovato sugli angoli e bordi del telefono, più un segno sul vetro. Quindi tolgo una stella, ma solo una perché comunque sono cose che con cover e vetro di protezione non si notano. Per il resto il telefono è una bomba, la batteria un po’ meno, è all’88% e non dura tutta la giornata. Se penso però che nuovo costa 1200€, più o meno, e che l’ho pagato circa 750€ va benissimo così.

Malgrado abbia contattato il venditore chiedendo una verifica della batteria prima della spedizione e mi sia proposta di pagare una differenza per un nuovo acquisto, anche in altro colore, di un prodotto migliore, l'iphone è arrivato con batteria solo al 86%. Lo provo un paio di giorni e valuto il reso

Ritengo che oggi sia fondamentale riciclare il più possibile...ì cellulari ricondizionati rispettano l'ambiente e permettono a chi acquista di risparmiare molto. Sono soddisfatta dell'acquisto che ho però scelto cercando ricondizionato in OTTIME CONDIZIONI. Esteticamente non ha un difetto e per ora anche il suo funzionamento è perfetto.
"
7334,B08PCD292R,5,"
Sono pienamente soddisfatto, nessun problema. Anzi… la batteria originale Apple nuova (100%) nessun graffio… Un ringraziamento va al venditore.Avrei, forse potuto aspettare ancora un po’ … il prezzo probabilmente sarebbe calato. Ma va bene così… per un prodotto ricondizionato… - da quello che sento e leggo in giro - Ripeto Non posso assolutamente lamentarmi.

 Esteticamente impeccabile.Visto che ho scelto un prodotto dalle condizioni “eccellenti” mi aspettavo una percentuale di batteria più alta almeno superiore al 90% mentre la batteria attualmente misura circa 83%. Scalda un po’ quando è sotto carica ma forse quello credo sia una caratteristica del del telefono.

Prima volta che acquisto smartphone di fascia alta ricondizionati:- il telefono si presenta in un imballo Phonem ben fatto, eccezion fatta per la protezione dello schermo totalmente assente in quanto esposto completamente a urti sul lato superiore frontale della scatola;- presenta minuscole imperfezioni appena visibili, quindi prodotto eccellente.Lo sto usando da qualche giorno e sembra tutto perfetto: edizione USA con antenna 5G laterale, per ora funzionante in tutto e per tutto.Giudizio generale ottimo, ma le uniche due pecche, per le quali non mi sento di fornire 5 stelle (specificatamente per il secondo punto), sono le seguenti:- Batteria al 88% della capacità massima, ma comunque entro i limiti del 80% minimo, ma mi sarei aspettato di meglio;- Alimentatore e cavo sono di bassissima fattura  (brandizzati Phonem) e per giunta nemmeno a carica rapida.Per questo secondo punto la questione è alquanto deludente in quanto la quasi totalità degli altri clienti hanno trovato, pur se non originali ma nei limiti di vendita, alimentatori da almeno 20W e cavi USB-C to Lightning, adatti ad un telefono di questo livello, e non capisco per quale motivo nel mio caso siano stati rimpiazzati da questi, tra l’altro inadatti e poco funzionali, obbligandomi a dover temporaneamente usare il vecchio alimentatore e cavo originali del mio iPhone 7 in attesa di ricevere, con altri soldi spesi, alimentatore e cavo nuovi ordinati il giorno stesso.  Consiglierei di rivedere gli accessori obbligatori per telefoni di questa fascia e di mettere in armonia i prezzi sui diversi canali nei quali vendete, per prodotti identici in modello, grado, capacità e colore. Non aggiungo altro.Mi riservo di rivedere la recensione.Giudizio generale ottimo ma non eccellente, venditore più che consigliato.

Ich habe das iPhone 12 Pro in Graphit mit ausgezeichneten Zustand gekauft das iPhone ist aus den USA erkennbar anhand der Antenne die es hier in Europa nicht gibt aber das ist egal sollte nur gesagt sein. Der Ramen ist fast komplett drum rum mit leichten Kratzern versehen was mich persönlich nicht stört da ich es in einer Hülle benutze die Rückseite ist markellos also perfekt. Der einzigste richte Kritikpunkt ist der Akku mit einer Kapazität von nur 88% daher muss ich den Akku bei Apple für 75 Euro selbst wechseln lassen behalte das Gerät trotzdem an sich ein gutes iPhone für den preis.

Compré este terminal hace dos días. Me llegó en 24 horas por DHL. Al principio lo compré con cierta reticencia al no ser enviado por Amazon y no leer precisamente buenas críticas de este vendedor. Admito que me la jugué, y todo por ahorrar, pero pensé, si sale mal el experimento, siempre tengo la opción de devolverlo gracias a la garantía de Amazon. Decir que en este caso acerté, el teléfono vino en estado impoluto (lo elegí dentro de la categoría excelente). Eso sí, la batería me vino con el 86% de salud. Me hubiera gustado un porcentaje más alto, pero está dentro de lo que prometen. En resumen, en mi caso, sí que recomiendo comprar terminales reacondicionados de Amazon. Espero que a alguien le haya servido de ayuda este comentario. Un saludo a tod@s y bona nit 😉

J'ai reçu le smartphone hier et j'ai été surprise agréablement en voyant l'aspect extérieur en excellent état ! Aucune rayures. Quelques traces de doigts seulement. En revanche l'état de la batterie 88% je suis moyennement contente. Ce qui m'a le plus déçu et franchement c'est abusé, un chargeur de 1ere génération !!! J'ai mis en charge hier le iphone car quasi plus de batterie quand je l'ai reçu, il a charger pendant 3h pour être à 100%, non mais sérieux, le vendeur aurait pu mettre un nouveau chargeur. En plus je n'ai pas reçu les écouteurs donc dégoûtée.

Sono veramente sorpreso dalla qualità del prodotto: Iphone nuovissimo, non ha neanche un graffietto. Lo stato della batteria è al 100% (sicuramente la terrò sotto controllo in questi mesi ma, se non aggiornerò la recensione, è perché non necessita di aggiornamenti). I venditori sono stati gentilissimi nel rispondermi subito circa un piccolo ritardo dovuto alla settimana del Black Friday. Il prodotto era inoltre ben sigillato, dotato anche di carica batterie. Non potevo farmi un regalo di Natale migliore!

Tutto molto bello, ma pagare 700€ e passa un telefono che dovrebbe essere in ottime condizioni ma con un graffione evidente sul display mi fa rodere parecchio. Inizialmente mi sembrava essere sulla pellicola, ma dopo averla sostituita con un’altra ho capito fosse sul vetro.Sarebbe stato il caso di segnalarlo considerando che è un difetto che si nota anche a più di 30cm di distanza. Ci sarebbe da dire che la fotocamera interna faccia pensare che non sia un iPhone, ovviamente lascia a desiderare. Il resto tutto ok, qualche altro piccolo difetto estetico ma passabile; batteria in buone condizioni.Non sono molto soddisfatta e ovviamente mi asterrò da fare acquisti in futuro da questo venditore.

A primera vista todo parece en buen estado, pero a la que empiezas a fijarte vas encontrando ralladas en la pantalla.El dispositivo viene sin limpiar… en mi caso tenía pegamento en el marco del teléfono.A los días he visto que la batería se gastaba con rapidez, con un uso mediano no podía llegar a las 10h, en mi caso ha llegado con un 86% de salud de batería a los días ha bajado 84%, la verdad a no ser que queráis 1 año de garantía o similar os recomiendo que busquéis uno en Wallapop que seguramente costará menos i tendrá un mejor estado que el “reacondicionado” o prepararos para gastar 75€ en una nueva batería.

7378,B08PCD292R,3,"
Premetto che è la prima volta in vita mia che compro un device ricondizionato perché sono abbastanza maniacale sulle mie cose. Ma data la situazione per cui mi serviva questo iphone sono stato disposto a qualche compromesso.Lo stato generale del telefono è più che buono. È arrivato senza la scatola originale ed imballato nella plastica antiurto dentro un pacchetto DHL assicurato.- Packaging non ci siamo proprio! - Capisco che si tratta di un ricondizionato ma un minimo di attenzione per uno smartphone di questa fascia credo ci voglia (ma questo è solo un consiglio per il venditore).Venendo al succo:Estetica ok!Ci sono dei graffietti qua e là, come si vede dalle immagini ma si tratta di graffi di utilizzo, probabilmente è stato esposto (ribadisco, io li noto perché in telefoni che uso quotidianamente da 3/4 anni quei graffi non ci sono ma per qualcuno potrebbero essere graffi fatti in poche settimane di utilizzo).Probabilmente il graffio sulla parte esterna del monitor (vicino allo slot della sim) è il peggiore, più profondo degli altri, probabilmente una caduta senza cover.La cosa peggiore è quella macchia in basso. Dalle foto si vede poco, non si tratta di un riflesso o di una ""ditata"" come potrebbe sembrare. Credo sia stata rovinata la scocca con qualche tipo di abrasione, forse con qualche prodotto che ha tolto il colore. Questo è piuttosto fastidioso ed è una delle motivazioni che mi fa dare 3 stelle.L'altra cosa che terrò sotto controllo è la batteria.Non appena arrivato ho fatto un controllo generale notando che la batteria era al 99% del suo stato di utilizzo.""Wow ho pensato, praticamente nuova!""Mentre scrivo lo sto utilizzando da due settimane e la batteria è scesa al 96% (con una ricarica al giorno).Questa cosa non è proprio normale, non vorrei che nel processo di ricondizionamento sia stata usata una batteria poco adeguata o fallata.Monitorerò la cosa e magari aggiornerò la recensione (se non mi sentite la cosa si è fermata la) ;-)

Cet iPhone 12 Pro reconditionné est impeccable, on le croirait neuf, seule la capacité de la batterie à 91% indique un smartphone d'occasion.  Tout fonctionne de manière fluide, la mise à jour sur iOS 16.1 n'a pas posé de souci et il tient la charge toute la journée - mais je ne joue pas en ligne et je ne regarde pas de séries.  Le bleu pacifique est superbe !10/10 pour le vendeur Certicom en Espagne.  J'ai reçu mon iPhone avant la date prévue dans une boîte blanche générique avec un câble et un chargeur MFI : plus qu'Apple ne fournit ces jours-ci !  J'ai malgré tout acheté un chargeur rapide 20W et un câble Lightning, tous les deux Apple, sur Amazon Warehouse.Bizarre quand même que le livreur (Colis Privé) mette le colis dans la boîte à lettres sans signature, ce n'est pas trop sécurisé...

Arrivato in una scatola anonima con una pellicola di vetro, cover, caricatore e cavetto nuovi (non originali), il prodotto è buono, schermo e retro perfetti, ha solo dei segni di usura (piccoli graffi) sui bordi in acciaio. Il mio è il modello americano, quello con l’antenna 5g per le onde millimetriche, la batteria ha l’89% di capacità, uniche pecche più fastidiose secondo me, è il fatto che un pulsante del volume sia un po’ più “rientrato” rispetto all’altro, le griglie in basso per speaker e microfono non sembrano state riassemblate correttamente (sono un po’ troppo rientrate) e lo schermo nel lato in basso a destra è un po’ scollato, quindi non mi sento di poterlo immergere in acqua con molta sicurezza, per il resto tutto buono

Il device funziona alla perfezione ed a prima vista esteticamente è ineccepibile, anche la batteria risulta pari al nuovo.Guardando con un pizzico di attenzione in più la qualità non è proprio eccellente, ho trovato dei segni sul bordo anteriore dello smart-watch, niente di particolarmente grave, ma la cosa che più si evidenzia è che sull'oggetto che mi è arrivato risulta perfettamente visibile che è stato sostituito il vetro anteriore, in controluce e in condizioni di scarso contrasto a schermo spento, si vede perfettamente come la riparazione non sia stata effettuata in modo professionale. La colla che si stende fra vetro e touch screen non è stata stesa alla perfezione e non copre tutto lo schermo, i risultato è che si vedono i contorni della colla, è vero che si notano solo in determinate condizioni, ma si notano e questo va in contrasto con la descrizione che viene fornita al momento della ricerca. Non è in eccellenti condizioni ma direi più in buone condizioni, detto questo per il resto niente da dire sia per la consegna sia per l'imballaggio e tanto meno sul perfetto funzionamento. Peccato per quel difettuccio che un po rovina il giudizio. Non so se a questo punto lo terrò, valuterò nei prossimi giorni quanto questa cosa mi rimane per la gola.

Looked like it was taken directly out of someone's phone case, and not cleaned.I was expecting a lot better for seven hundred Euro.You know, with a little effort, stainless steel can be polished, to get rid of scratches.Man, I really don't like leaving negative reviews.I was buying this for one of the Ukrainian children living with me.I would have been embarrassed giving this phone to her.I'll give it two stars, since a phone was actually delivered to me.I immediately returned this phone.Bought a new iPhone 13 instead.This was my first experience with a refurbished phone.I 'd be very reluctant to buy a refurbished phone again.I'm giving five stars for the screen and storage, not having seen either, I trust that they were as described.In addition to this refurbished phone that I returned, I also bought an Apple iPhone 12 Pro, 128GB from Swappie.For the same price, it is like a brand new phone - in immaculate condition.Oh, and I'm still waiting for my refund from Ava Direct.I suppose I'll get it, some day...

Había leído comentarios de que algunos venían con imperfecciones, pero el mío llegó perfecto, como nuevo. Salud de batería al 100% y sin ningún rasguño por ninguna parte.He cambiado del iPhone xR al 11 pro y se nota la diferencia. Muy contenta.Venía con cargador.

El producto llegó un día antes, entiendo que el producto es reacondicionado, pero indica que no tiene marcas visibles a 20cm, el caso que llegó con todas las esquinas con picadas, visible a más de 40cm, la batería al 95% y la pantalla perfecta, pero estéticamente se ven marcas de caídas. El teléfono lo envío ciclozero, no creo que vuelva a comprar un reacondicionado, al meno de esta marca. Por lo demás genial, el cargador es “chino” y el cable parece original. No se ha producido a la devolución por qué necesito el teléfono para el trabajo.

Nulla da dire riguardo al telefono che è pari al nuovo, tutto perfettamente funzionante, batteria al 99% e zero graffi o imperfezioni.Riguardo alla spedizione però, purtroppo, mi sono trovata davvero male. Non mi aspettavo la confezione originale apple in quanto in descrizione era scritto che sarebbe stato consegnato in una scatola anonima, però non mi aspettavo neanche di trovarmi, una volta aperto il pacco, il telefono già acceso e quasi scarico avvolto solo da una busta di plastica e dall’imballaggio sempre in plastica. Nessuna scatolina anonima come promesso dalla descrizione e anche il caricatore avvolto da una plastica sottile.Ad ogni modo il telefono funziona e pare non aver subito danni in seguito all’evidente carenza di un imballaggio come si deve.

Gekauft als generalüberholt. Gerät schaut brandneu aus, wie frisch vom Band gefallen: keinerlei Kratzer, Macken oder ähnliches! Wer braucht da noch neu kaufen?!Für mich persönlich war das 12 Pro jedoch leider zu groß und zu schwer. 1-Hand-Bedienung oft schwierig und in der Hosentasche hat man das Gerät deutlich gespürt. Des weiteren wirkt meiner Meinung nach das 12er (& 13er) Modell aufgrund des eckigen (Retro-) Designs dicker und unergonomischer als z.B. ein 11er Modell mit den abgerundeten Ecken. Gerät wurde deshalb umgetauscht. Rückabwicklung ohne Probleme!

Il telefono è pari al nuovo in condizioni perfette, arrivato con gls in una confezione improvvisata ma ben protetto. Il venditore ha aggiunto un carica batterie di iPhone X e precedenti in più la spilletta togli sim. L’iPhone è il modello americano perché presenta l’antenna supplementare per il 5G necessaria per gli Stati Uniti d’America che si trova sul lato destro del telefono. Per questo il prezzo è più conveniente ma ripeto il telefono è pari al nuovo è solo una questione estetica che può interessare come no. Comunque venditore con ottimi prodotti ma deludente per quanto riguarda l’assistenza. Avevo mandato un paio di mail per la tracciabilita del pacco e non ho mai avuto risposta. Anche sul numero di cellulare ho mandato un messaggio whatsapp che ancora non riceve, ho anche provato a chiamare ma era sempre spento. Ma a me interessa che il telefono funzioni e che sia in ottimo stato.  Comunque Incrocio le dita e darò notizie in seguito.

Il telefono è arrivato in una scatola anonima dotato di carica batterie e cavetto + spilletta per la sim.Il telefono in se non presenta nessun graffio o segno di usura e la capacità della batteria è al 100% quindi è un telefono nuovo! Consegna rapida, il giorno dopo la data prevista, arrivato proprio in tempo. Sono davvero soddisfatta anche per quanto riguarda la serietà del venditore e la risposta rapida dei messaggi. Prezzo davvero ottimo in quanto telefono identico al nuovo, poiché comprando uno nuovo nei negozi apple ancora si pagano sui 1000€ . Sono molto soddisfatta, lo consiglio

Ho acquistato un Iphone 12 proPensavo acquistando un prodotto ricondizionato che avesse qualche imperfezione, invece zero, nessuna, il prodotto è pari al nuovo. Arrivato in tre giorni, buona confezione, pacchetto con logo ""loop"", dentro caricabatterie e chiavetta per sim, oltre le istruzioni. L'ho portato a mettere la cover ed il venditore si è complimentato per lo stato del cellulare. Che dire fa foto splendide, il riconoscimento facciale è perfetto per l'home banking e per le altre app, la velocità è portentosa, il suono anche. Un consiglio anche se condizionato scegliete il venditore e non badate a risparmiare. C'è sempre il detto di chi più spende, meglio spende.

Diese Rezension beschreibt NICHT das iPhone 12, sondern den Kauf bei ""Amazon Renewed""/""Mobihub.de"".LieferungDie Lieferung wurde nach zwei Tagen zugestellt. Neben dem iPhone lagen noch ein No Name-Ladegerät und eine Sim-Nadel im Paket. OVP und die originalen Apple Zubehöre waren - wie in der Artikelbeschreibung erwähnt - nicht enthalten.Äußerer ZustandDer äußere Zustand des iPhones entsprach ebenfalls der Artikelbeschreibung: aus 30 Zentimeter Entfernung waren überhaupt keine Gebrauchsspuren erkennbar. Selbst bei genauer Betrachtung erwiesen sich alle Oberflächen als makellos. Das möchte ich extra hervorheben: Das Gerät ist ziemlich genau ein Jahr alt und hat trotzdem eine neuwertige Optik.Die Schalter/Taster am Gehäuse sind ebenso in Ordnung. Einziger kleiner Schwachpunkt: Der Lautlos-Schalter ist sehr schwergängig. Es wirkt, als ob im Inneren des Schalters fest gebackener Staub wäre. Die Funktionalität ist dadurch jedoch nicht eingeschränkt. Man kann den Schalter halt nicht ""so nebenbei"" betätigen, sondern muss sich darauf konzentrieren und die Rückmeldung am Display kontrollieren.TechnikDas iPhone war auf Werkseinstellungen zurückgesetzt und konnte problemlos gestartet/installiert werden.Im Betrieb treten keinerlei Fehlfunktionen auf.Der Akku ist bei akzeptablen 89 %. Das liegt im Korridor der Artikelbeschreibung (""über 80 %""). Es lässt aber auch auf eine intensive Nutzung im ersten Lebensjahr schließen.FazitBei Renewed/Refurbished-Angeboten ist natürlich keine allgemeine Aussage möglich, da sich jedes Exemplar vom anderen unterscheiden kann.Für ""mein"" iPhone kann ich sagen: bisher ein Kauf ohne Reue. Das Produkt entspricht der Artikelbeschreibung. Es gibt keinen Anlass zu Kritik.Und sollte doch noch ein Fehler auftauchen, würde die Garantie von 12 Monaten greifen.

Il prodotto oltre ad avere qualche segno di usura (che comprendo possa avere in quanto ricondizionato) aveva delle macchie di grasso che potevano benissimo essere quantomeno tolte prima di metterlo in commercio.La cosa imperdonabile è sicuramente l'audio danneggiato. Ho ascoltato varie canzoni comparandolo con un'altra 12 pro e con il mio si sente distorto. Persino comprando la suoneria, nel mio caso si sente che non è pulita ma con una leggera distorsione. Per me che lavoro nel settore musicale è un guasto imperdonabileNon ha alcun senso acquistare un ricondizionato se poi non vengono fatti i test a dovere per sostituire parti danneggiate...Per questo richiederò il rimborsoPer questa ragione richiederò il rimborso

7453,B08PCD292R,3,"
Il telefono è venuto molto bello, senza grafie e con la batteria 90%. Però lo schermo sembra di essere stato cambiato perché il touchscreen è molto lento. Non è veloce come un schermo originale. Avevo pensato di essere colpa della pellicola, ma no. È proprio del telefono.

7454,B08PCD292R,3,"
Prodotto rigenerato, consegnato in tempi celeri. Il prodotto si presenta in una scatola generica Loop, lo smartphone all’interno compreso di cavo e in uno scatolo separato il caricabatterie da 30w. Il telefono è in perfette condizioni estetiche, batteria al 98% (nel giro di qualche settimana scesa al 96%). Unica pecca, durante la prima configurazione ho notato con mio profondo dispiacere, una piccola, quasi impercettibile macchiolina nera nel lato basso/sinistro del display confinante con il bordo del display (sicuramente Pixel Bruciato). Non ho chiesto la sostituzione perché resterei a piedi(senza smartphone) e ne ho necessità per lavoro. Per me questo problema è un pugno in faccia perché da quando l’ho notato mi porta nervoso (mi cade l'occhio lì) visto la fiducia riposta è il prezzo pagato.

Tras estar bastante escéptico a comprar un iphone reacondicionado, me animé teniendo en cuenta la garantía de amazon y que en caso de que tuviera cualquier problema lo podía devolver y listo. Pues bien, el teléfono ha llegado en muy buena condición. Ningún rasguño en la carcasa y un pequeño arañazo casi imperceptible en la pantalla principal, que además viene cubierta de un protector. La salud de la batería está al 92%. La verdad es que para mí este punto es muy importante y un 92% para mí si es aceptable. Seguiré probándolo pero por ahora solo estoy teniendo buenas sensaciones y si todo sigue así me quedaré el dispositivo. Muy contento.

Modello destinato al mercato americano in quanto provvisto di modulo 5G mmWave che si può notare da una tacca appena percettibile al di sotto del pulsante di accensione, ma non sfruttabile in Italia (per ora). Il prodotto è di qualità come tutti gli iPhone che non vengono maltrattati, trattandosi di un ricondizionato.

Wie von Apple zu erwarten, hat dieses Telefon keinerlei Macken, hängt sich nie auf und sieht optisch (bis auf die gewöhnungsbedürftige Notch) nicht schlecht aus. Die Kameras funktionieren einwandfrei und während eines Videos kann es perfekt zwischen den verschiedenen Linsen wechseln, ohne das das Videomaterial darunter leidet. Da es das erste Apple iPhone für mich ist, muss ich mich noch von umständlichen Android hin zum einfach zu bedienenden Alleskönner umstellen. Der Batteriezustand ist leider nur bei 88% gewesen, aber er hält trotzdem den Tag durch.Klare Kaufempfehlung an dieser Stelle für das iPhone 12 Pro in der 128 GB Variante.Da ich leider keinen 5G-fähigen Vertrag habe, kann ich dazu nichts sagen, aber LTE /4G reicht für normale Zwecke vollkommen aus.

Nel corso della vita ho acquistato diversi telefoni. Tanti nuovi e diversi ricondizionati.Se si ragiona con calma e a sangue freddo si capisce che si può ottenere ottimo prodotto di modello precedente ( rispetto quello che si vende adesso) a un prezzo davvero interessante ( non regalato).Preso su Amazon e lo utilizzo da due mesi. Non vedo nessun minimo difetto, funziona perfettamente, batteria nuova e nessun graffio o segno di usura. Vi consiglio vivamente di considerare ricondizionato al posto del nuovo

Compré el Iphone 12pro en condición supuestamente excelente por 809€ , Según la descripción y sus términos, no debería tener arañazos ni desperfectos estéticos en pantalla, laterales ni marcas visibles a 30cm de distancia, lo cual no se cumplió en ningún aspecto. Cabe decir que fue el único que rebajaron 100€ en 1semana y decían que era el último en stock, a pesar de que repusieron 1 o 2 más, sin embargo al pedir un cambio, me dijeron que no tenían ninguno en stock en esas condiciones. Para mi sorpresa, me encuentro lo que veis en las fotos. Un terminal en Condiciones satisfactorias y además me querían cobrar 12€ de envío para la devolución. Tuve que recurrir a Amazon y a las cláusulas de Amazon Renewed para llevar a cabo la devolución para recibir el reembolso integro.Experiencia muy mala...

Acquistato e spedito Venerdì, consegnato martedì mattina.Il telefono arriva in una confezione non originale, completo di cavo usb-c lightning, estrattore sim e, udite udite, caricatore usb-c da 30 watt.Il telefono è praticamente perfetto; ha solo una piccola ammaccatura nell’angolo inferiore sinistro, perfettamente camuffata dalla cover.

Rimpiango il vecchio 6 plus, che ho cambiato dopo sei anni, causa  vetro rotto e batteria esaurita, mai cambiata. Il 12 pro, anche se ricondizionato con batteria al 90%, ha una ridotta durata della batteria, di gran lunga inferiore alle prestazioni dichiarate e attese. L'unico aspetto apprezzato è il grandangolo e l'uso con poca luce della fotocamera.

Il cellulare è assolutamente pari al nuovo, con una capacità residua del 96% della batteria e l’assoluta assenza di imperfezioni. Ottimo acquisto come sempre Amazon è una garanzia in più.

 Prima e sicuramente ultima esperienza con un telefono ricondizionato. La confezione poteva essere curata meglio mettendo una pellicola protettiva adesiva sullo schermo,Il telefono era stato ripulito sommariamente aveva polvere e sporcizia sia nell attacco di ricarica della batteria che bello sportellino sim che intorno alle fotocamere inoltre non ho potuto valutare niente altro in quanto. On sono riuscito neanche a configurarlo perché dopo selezionata la lingua alla selezione del paese il telefono si bloccava e dopo venti secondi mi rimandava alla selezione della lingua.

Pagato rigenertao circa 850€. Esteticamente molto bene, ma batteria al 90% (ok che ancora buona ma x 850€ la potevano cambiare), problemi di connessione bluetooth (sia watch, sia airpods, sia altre marche….no), problemi di connessione con la macchina.Restituito subito
"
7523,B08PCD292R,3,"
The phone arrived in perfect conditions the only problem I’ve seen is with the battery it dies quite faster than expected but that also might be related to the usage I give to it but it doesn’t lasts all day long.

Acquistato dopo aver visto alcune recensioni, ma sono rimasto un po’ deluso. Batteria al 89% e con alcuni graffi sul lo schermo e al entrata del carica batteria. Il se ascolti una canzone il telefono si scarica in maniera folle. Pensavo davvero che avessi più qualità.

Absoluter Fehlkauf! Habe das iPhone mit ausgezeichnetem Zustand bestellt. Das Gerät kam absolut verschmutzt an. Die Lautsprecher sind völlig verdreckt und dicht. Die Akkuleistung betrug gerade mal noch 85%. Also definitiv nicht generalüberholt! Noch dazu war eine fremde Simkarte im Telefon und es kamen ausländische Nachrichten an. Die Verpackung wurde mit Aufklebern komplett zugeklebt, dass eine schadensfreie Entfernung nicht möglich war.Suchen sie sich einen anderen Verkäufer für ihr Gerät. Katastrophe. Nie wieder!
"
7532,B08PCD292R,5,"
Also ich bin echt begeistert. Die Lieferung erfolgte wirklich sehr schnell und der Zustand ist wirklich 1a. 100% Batterie, kaum äußerliche Gebrauchsspuren. Echt Top!
"
7533,B08PCD292R,5,"
Absolut zu empfehlen. Ist mein erstes iPhone, ich wollte zusätzlich zum Preis auch die Umwelt schonen und daher ein refurbished kaufen. Allerdings war ich etwas unsicher was mich wohl erwarten würde… alles super! Der Akku liegt bei 98% Kapa, und der Zustand ist echt der Hammer. Bis auf ein paar Mikrokratzer am seitlichen Rahmen alles top. Kann’s nur jedem empfehlen!
"
7534,B08PCD292R,5,"
Il telefono è pari al nuovo, a dir poco impeccabile. Il modo con cui è stato impacchettato a mio dire pessimo. Per il resto davvero ottimo davvero.

L’iPhone 12 pro che ho acquistato ricondizionato come condizioni “eccellenti” presenta delle imperfezioni estetiche ed inoltre una vite in prossimità del connettore lightnin è leggermente svitata.Durante le prime prove di funzionamento ho subito notato una bassa potenza e qualità dell’audio sonoro dell’altoparlante. Successivamente mi sono accorto che la cuffia per le chiamate audio non funziona. Provvederò al rimborso

Das Display ist super und die Akkulaufzeit ist wie bei einem Neugerät.Der Versand ging sehr flott und sicher verpackt.

Lo compré, dentro de pocos dias empezó a calentar, si Quito la tarjeta de telefonía el móvil estaba bien, al poner la tarjeta empezaba a calentar hasta que no se podía más tener el móvil en la mano y no respondía la pantalla. La batería completa se descargaba en 10 min cuando empezaba el mensaje de calentamiento.No se otros productos de ellos pues sólo compre una vez, pero mi experiencia fue FATAL. No se puede fiar de un móvil así sin verlo. Mejor comprar de algún conocido

Me ha gustado la rapidez. No me ha gustado que no tenga caja, ni cargador y cable original ni la aguja para sacar la sim. Tiene un precio elevado para ser reacondicionado con esas faltas. También tenía un rozón en una esquina.Deberían especificar los detalles del producto antes de enviarlo y evitar sorpresas desagradables. Además hay que pagar por devolverlo.

Das gebrauchte IPhone12 pro kam wie angekündigt in einer neutralen Verpackung mit Ladekabel und Zubehöradapter. Die Lieferung war schneller als angekündigt. Der Akku bei 93%, also alles super…?Leider konnte ich nur über den Lautsprecher telefonieren, die Hörmuschel funktioniert nicht.Apple hat hierzu auch schon mitgeteilt:„Apple hat festgestellt, dass es bei einem sehr kleinen Prozentsatz von iPhone 12- und iPhone 12 Pro-Geräten aufgrund einer eventuell fehlerhaften Komponente des Hörermoduls in manchen Fällen zu Tonproblemen kommen kann. Betroffene Geräte wurden zwischen Oktober 2020 und April 2021 hergestellt.Wenn dein iPhone 12 oder iPhone 12 Pro beim Tätigen oder Empfangen von Anrufen keinen Ton aus dem Hörer abgibt, ist es möglicherweise für Service qualifiziert.Qualifizierte Geräte werden von Apple oder einem autorisierten Apple Service Provider kostenlos repariert“Nur war dies bei dem gelieferten nicht mehr möglich, da die Garantiezeit abgelaufen war - das Telefon also nicht mehr „qualifiziert“ war.Das hätte eigentlich bei einem Test auffallen müssen. Werde das Telefon daher zurück schicken.

Nach mehreren Versuchen mit verschiedenen Original Apple Kopfhörern (die alle auf einem anderen Gerät einwandfrei funktionieren!!), kann ich nur sagen - Finger weg von Refurbed.

Handy war optimistisch entsprechend der Vorstellung (kleiner optisch gut sichtbarer Kratzer entsprach nicht der Vorstellungwar aber akzeptabel für den Preis).

I ordered a 256gb refurbished 13 pro. The trick is as you navigate through the colours or memory sizes, the refurbishment category keeps changing (excellent-good-fair) and you need to look one final time before placing an order!I got a phone in fair condition, which means dents and scratches which are visible. The side panel shows signs of damage as well.The battery health is 98% and phone is registered with Apple. All features work. So far I am able to get 4G only. So 5G is not tested.Finally, this seller must improve their packaging. When the phone arrived, it had lot of dew all over. A simple thing like a silica gel desiccant could have prevented this. After all, you pay a lot of money for an iPhone 13pro and expect the packaging not to damage it.
"
7637,B0BBPFDTNZ,5,"
At first, I was a little hesitant in buying this phone as it was refurbished/renewed, though I took the plunge and I'm so glad I it. This amazing iphone has 100% battery life, fantastic memory and when taking photos, wow.I orderd this on a Monday and was told that it would come on Friday. This iphone came on a Wednesday, so kudos to the seller as well.For something that was second hand, you wouldn't thnk it. This Is Definitely Like New and if you are looking for an upgrade then take the plunge like I did and get this fabtastic iphone
"
7638,B0BBPFDTNZ,4,"
A good seller who replies within 1 day.Phones are in quite good condition. Packaging can be improved. Price is very decent. The devices should be cleaned better before they get dispatched to the customers.I got 1 x iphone 13 pro max 256gb ""excellent"" condition which was excellent indeed. 94% battery but I had to spend some time cleaning the edges and cameras of the phone from dirt.I also ordered 1 x iphone 13 pro 256gb accidentally ""excellent condition"". This was not a real excellent since it came with lots of scratches on the screen. the battery life was 99% though.Overall, I recommend the seller since you're backed up by Amazon. He communicates well and he listens to his customers

Few minor marks on the sides as expected, but great condition for an used phone. More than 90% battery life on this particular device and face recognition works perfectly. Recommend it 👍🏽

Got mine with 93% battery life and is impeccable. Had it for over a week and didn’t notice anything wrong performance wise - calls, video, speed.I really had to squint to notice any tiny scratches. I’m glad I made myself this gift instead of purchasing a more expensive one on a contract. It came with a new charging cable, so did feel a bit like getting a new phone apart (from the neutral packaging).Now I’m researching how to take better Xmas photos with the iphone13 Pro camera. :)

Happy with the delivery speed. I ordered 2 mobiles one 13 pro 512GB & other 1 TB. It arrived 1 day before committed arrival day. The delivery was in sellers box with Trustpilot rating. The parcel consist of mobile and a charging cable(no adapter). The mobile was perfectly packed in a thin transparent sheet. It looks exactly like brand new, no marks, scratches. The device works as expected. Got all useful apps installed successfully.The charging cable for 1 mobile seems faulty and I have contacted seller. Waiting for his revert. Apart from that am still not able to say about battery life. It’s first time my mobile is charged 100% since I got it and while writing this review.Overall happy with the product. I am expecting seller to send me a new charging cable. Will update my post on what seller has to say.

Wasn’t sure what to expect as I’ve never bought a renewed phone before but I have to say I’m impressed! Not a single scratch on the screen or body, battery health is 98% and it even came with a brand new genuine USB apple cable (rather than USB C which would have been annoying as I don’t have USB C plugs). I did notice the little speaker grill at the top of the screen is dirty and needs a clean but apart from that the phone is like new!
"
7656,B0BBPFDTNZ,3,"
I have just received an iphone 13 Pro. The phone externally looks in great condition but the battery charge is only 16%. It said that it had to be at least 80% when arriving so I hope this is not a problem with the battery.
"

Already written a review as I bought 2 “renewed phones

7658,B0BBPFDTNZ,3,"
I like the way it was packaged and the phine had no damages on it but. My battery life was only 88% unlike the reviews which all said it was 98% and 100% but apart from that it is good
"

The conditions and number of scratches were way too far of acceptable. Amazon should not permit this and should put Standards for this type of transactions.

Although it arrived in a plain cardboard box, this was essentially a new phone, with no marks, scratches or signs of any wear and tear.Upon registering the phone with Apple it came up that the warranty had started in July - so clearly it had been switched on and registered at some point - but otherwise 100% mint conditionWould definitely recommended, as effectively it's saving you £100s on a new phone direct from Amazon or Apple, but maybe just keep an eye on the warranty start/end date - this one was only a couple of months off the full 12, but clearly this may not always be the case...

I have used mazuma many times before and had good service. This time, felt very confident buying an expensive but refurbished phone as it was through Amazon via mazuma. I didn’t start using it for 2 weeks but when I did, over the Christmas period it was clearly faulty. The speaker function failed the microphone didn’t work and it constantly turned off on the middle of calls. The seller agreed a return and has now refused a refund saying it works. I am shocked at the appalling customer service. Never again. Straight to apple next time

I would have described it as ‘excellent’. As far as the usability of the phone, brilliantly easy when you’ve had 5 previous iPhones. My only slight disappointment was the battery only has 87% remaining. I can’t grumble really as it was only sold as more than 80%.

I ordered a 256gb refurbished 13 pro. The trick is as you navigate through the colours or memory sizes, the refurbishment category keeps changing (excellent-good-fair) and you need to look one final time before placing an order!I got a phone in fair condition, which means dents and scratches which are visible. The side panel shows signs of damage as well.The battery health is 98% and phone is registered with Apple. All features work. So far I am able to get 4G only. So 5G is not tested.Finally, this seller must improve their packaging. When the phone arrived, it had lot of dew all over. A simple thing like a silica gel desiccant could have prevented this. After all, you pay a lot of money for an iPhone 13pro and expect the packaging not to damage it.
"
7697,B09MGF7618,5,"
At first, I was a little hesitant in buying this phone as it was refurbished/renewed, though I took the plunge and I'm so glad I it. This amazing iphone has 100% battery life, fantastic memory and when taking photos, wow.I orderd this on a Monday and was told that it would come on Friday. This iphone came on a Wednesday, so kudos to the seller as well.For something that was second hand, you wouldn't thnk it. This Is Definitely Like New and if you are looking for an upgrade then take the plunge like I did and get this fabtastic iphone
"
7698,B09MGF7618,4,"
A good seller who replies within 1 day.Phones are in quite good condition. Packaging can be improved. Price is very decent. The devices should be cleaned better before they get dispatched to the customers.I got 1 x iphone 13 pro max 256gb ""excellent"" condition which was excellent indeed. 94% battery but I had to spend some time cleaning the edges and cameras of the phone from dirt.I also ordered 1 x iphone 13 pro 256gb accidentally ""excellent condition"". This was not a real excellent since it came with lots of scratches on the screen. the battery life was 99% though.Overall, I recommend the seller since you're backed up by Amazon. He communicates well and he listens to his customers

There was some dust on the phone but that was fixed with a quick wipe. Another thing is that the charger cable was not lightning to usb c but usb a to lightning, not a problem just inconvenient as it is less inefficient than the actual charger you get.If you are on the fence of buying this phone like i was get it because it was an absolute steal for 800 very happy with my purchase.

Overall a very good phone, and serves its purpose- finally replaced my old iPhone 7.  It needs a bit of getting used to slid to the next screen.Saved £££ during Prime Day.  Items arrived opened box and without a manual- but received an extra discount.  Very pleased with the extra saving!
"
7762,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
I had one of these a while ago but it was the first that Apple brought out. When I got a new Apple I passed it onto the wife and she thought it was great, years pass and the phone packs up ( the battery) so I bought her the iPhone 12 upgraded version it’s taken a while to get her bearings on it but she getting there!
"
7763,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
As expected
"
7764,B08L5QVFCT,4,"
So the phone works amazing had it for a good few months now and has done me wonders but the only problem is the battery seems to not last as long as it should do I don’t know if it got damaged on the way or that’s me just having to much of expectations but other than that I would recommend having this phone

My last iPhone was the 1st Gen iPhone SE in 2016, it was great however it had a small 32GB storage, I got rid of it because I kept running out of space and iCloud drive wasn't great at the time, hence I got the 256GB capacity iPhone 12Been on Android for 5 years and it's been a welcome return back to iPhone, the phone is smooth, animations are immediate, FaceID has never let me down, with Apple's 20W charger, the charge time is pretty good too. iPhone 12 has wireless charging which makes it perfect to charge conveniently in the car.Battery life is okay, nothing to write home about, I'm a power user and I can get 6 hours of screen on time day to day, and very rarely have I killed it in one day.Design wise, if you loved the iPhone 4, you'll love this, it's an extension of that design idea, not slippery to hold like previous iPhones, this is Apple at it's best when it comes to industrial design.Highly recommend the iPhone 12, I think it's the pick of the bunch since the Pro models have the same A14 processor and unless you really want LiDAR and the extra macro camera, I think this is the pick of the bunch.

Ordered to replace my iPhone 11. Phone has a great camera, facial recognition, easy to use, clear screen quality etc… but the battery does not last long at all. I feel I am constantly having to charge it up where I could have the same usage with my iPhone 11 and the battery would last all day.

A real bargain from Amazon warehouse. Came in pristine condition 100% battery and 9 months of Apple care still on the phone.Happy customer and would definitely look at finding the same deal again in the future

This was a replacement for my ageing iPhone 7plus and it was worth the wait. I got this before the iPhone 13 was release at a very good price, its screen, battery life and speed are all excellent and with the longevity of the apple devices and the support for several years of updates I had no hesitation to buy another over the android devices that have very poor support for anything more than one year. I have been delighted with the ease of migrating data from one phone to the next which used wireless pairing and seamless migration of everything from my old phone to the new one. The camera is also excellent and its a nice device to hold too. Shame I have to put it in a case for work due to the hostile environments I work in. Otherwise I would recommend this to those looking for an upgrade from an older device at a more affordable price

Had to send my XR back bad connection problems but usual excellent customer service from Amazon so decided to upgrade to a 12 not a lot of cosmetic difference between them nothing seem to change much on the working aspect of the phones keep giving fancy write ups re the camera but sadly a picture is a picture to me I don’t see the difference between any photos never really grasp the extortionate prices for I phones one is much like the other if you compare them on apples compare I phones there is very little difference in the phone apart from the price legalised extortion by apple really had all different models of iPhones since their conception only had trouble with the XR but the warranty covered that so see how this one goes

The only thing I was pleasantly surprised about after a few days usage is the battery life, which I expected to be worse after reading other reviews. I'm coming from an iPhone 7 Plus that I used for 4 years, so I was expecting to notice the upgrade. I easily manage to get 30-40% charge at the end of the day with normal use (about 1h in voice calls, 15 minutes videocall, occasional YouTube videos, texting and 3-4 pictures throughout the day).I'm not using the camera for pictures and videos much, as I prefer using my Fujifilm mirrorless for photography.I love the blue color, but I am biased as it is my favorite. I was tempted by the black one, which I believe is going to be the most picked one. Face ID works like a charm. It's unfortunate we are in a pandemic and wear masks when shopping, so Face ID won't work for contactless payments. It does quickly switch to passcode though, so you can avoid removing your face covering, as you are not supposed to. I have tried recommended methods to make it work with a face covering, but it did not work for me.

The iPhone 12 is a brilliant phone. I originally had an iPhone 8 and upgraded to the 12. The camera is brilliant - the pictures come out so crisp and look amazing. I like the more rounder edges of this iPhone as well. I got the iPhone 12 in blue and it looks so great, the picture of it doesn’t do it justice! The only downside of this is that due to the price I’d have hoped to have got headphones and I thankfully already had a mains plug but if someone else was buying an apple product for the first time then you will need to buy one or you aren’t able to charge your phone. The size is of this phone is great too, I’m so glad I didn’t go for the bigger size because this can fit into your pocket perfectly. I love that this has face recognition (what did I do before this?!) it’s so much easier to use now even though with having to use masks all the time right now it isn’t difficult for that but worth it if you aren’t needing to use Apple Pay!

7778,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
I purchased the iPhone 12 to replace my iPhone SE on which the battery was failing and needed recharging more than once a day. As soon as I received the new phone (the day after I ordered it, excellent service) I transferred the contents to the new phone without having to get assistance, so other than being a bit bigger it is as easy to use as the last phone. The keyboard is bigger so easier for me to type. Face recognition, the first time I have used it is brilliant but I fear I may forget my passwords as it is easier to use. All in all it is a great phone I haven’t used the camera yet, but I’m pretty sure it will be better than my old phone. Now charging once every two days, for now. I can only say that I love iPhones and think they are worth the extra money.👍

The last time I bought a new iPhone was in 2011, since then I’ve always bought 2nd hand because of the cost, but this time Amazon let me get the phone on monthly payments.I went for the iPhone 12 256GB and WOW, I was impressed the 1st night I had it. I’m a photo taker and this phone just amazes me with the quality of the camera alone. All the photos were taken at night with NO flash and they look amazing.Siri listens for the 1st time ever!It’s soooooo loud compared to my old 7s Plus, it’s almost like I have a soundbar in my pocket!I love the colour, I went for the Green one, well it is different!It’s seriously fast too, once I ordered a 5G sim from my provider that is!I have zero complaints about the phone, worth the money as I know it will last!

I like it, battery long life, the phone so good.
"
7782,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Expensive for what it is, but then all the newest phones are.It is a nice phone though and I feel if you’ve had multiple iphones in the past, you know what it’s all about. It’ll take some adjusting to without having a home button at the bottom and a few additional button combinations and swipe patterns to get used.The camera’s are a noticeable improvement, and I do like the face id to unlock - and when I’m wearing a face mask it will still unlock if it detects I’m wearing my apple watch so it knows it’s me.The bigger screen is nice and I’m hoping the battery lasts longer with it being bigger but I have to say I do like having a phone you can operate with 1 hand and this does require 2 to reach all extremities of the screen.
"
7783,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
I like it. No problem with it just like it’s says in description. Brand new. No damages. Working perfectly.
"
7784,B08L5QVFCT,4,"
It's fairly responsive in touch and speed with opening appsThe camera doesn't feel that much improved but it's still very goodI'd say the best thing about the phone is the better CPU allow smooth operation and of course a better battery lifeI've given 4 stars due to the fact that Apple take the  liberty of removing earphones, chargers or adapters. I sincerely hope other companies don't follow suit.It's crazy enough paying almost 1k for phones nowadays and to receive nothing else additional feels like robbery

I bought this iPhone two days ago and it arrived today. I confess I was so afraid of being robbed on the way from UK to Dublin. Well, thank Gosh it didn't happen. I got it, recharged, put my acc on it, all my apps, SIM card and everything is absolutely fantastic. I don't think I need to write about the performance of the phone (because it's awesome) but I am sure to recommend if you are looking for a phone here in Amazon, check the sellers and the reviews and pray :DThank you

7792,B08L5QVFCT,4,"
Phone arrived on time, the currier arrived to the door and we both was scared on the trade of parcel for password and at the end we made safe; nothing wrong with the currier, the shipping was excellent. I turned on the phone and the system started with aggressive configurations and queries for phone identifier, I text a software engineer in the group to restore IMEI and component serial, technically the amazon control team was using a foreign country identification for myself name, and I am attending the reset to first start of the phone to obtain primary original IOS addons and amazon shopping reference in UK.
"
7793,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
This is definitely my favourite iphone I have had so far, the design is great and feels really nice to hold and feels really smooth to use with its fast speeds, the camera takes really nice clear pictures and the video quality is great, also the sound from the speakers is great and loud which is good when watching videos and listing to music on, the screen size is also perfect for me as not to big and not to small, nice to watch YouTube and other videos on and also good for gaming as games also run nice and smooth. This is the perfect mobile phone for me as does everything i want and just the right size. Highly recommend this iphone as very happy with it.

Bought this phone sim free to replace my old iPhone 6s Plus. Fantastic phone that I’ve just had for over a week now and I love it. Really impressed by the quality of camera too. Great purchase!
"
7795,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Apple rarely disappoint because they follow a formula that works. If you have used iPhone in the last 5 years. You come to expect what iPhone’s are capable with. This iPhone was purchased as an upgrade from an iPhone 8 Plus for my mum and it is an healthy upgrade. If you have an 11 or XR maybe wait till 14 because by that point their should be a noticeable upgrade.
"
7796,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
We always save up and purchase our phones out right and then get a monthly sim only deal as you save a fortune over a 2/3 year contract. This iPhone isn’t all bells and whistles - not a huge difference from our previous iPhone 7 Plus - however the camera is significantly better and the battery life lasts a whole day without charging and the face recognition is quick and easy - even wearing glasses or a mask! . Having said that, I probably don’t use all the features on it - so may be missing out on some major upgrades - but for my needs it’s perfect.We are an Apple family and love them and if that’s the case, would recommend this phone.
"
7797,B08L5QVFCT,4,"
Very good Smartphone - like ever - but one important thing is missing: FingerPrint reader. Nowadays where we are constantly using masks, just face recognition is not enough. It should have kept the fingerprint reader - in the same way I have in my old iPhone 8.I have a Xiaomi that costs 30% - and IT contains both, face and fingerprint options. This is a very expensive product, should bring everything - including the charger... come on!
"
7798,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Used Android phones for years, pretty much every pixel phone, and quite a few samsungs, thought it was time to try an iphone.Love it, nice design, quality, great camera and battery life.Everything about it feels premium.
"
7799,B08L5QVFCT,3,"
Pros:It gives premium feel and rich experience, which is obvious.Camera is really good which iPhone is known for.Cons:Sometime it hangs all of a sudden. The app icons doesn't work at all. And I must restart the phone to make it work again. It may be one device issue but it shouldn't be even for one device given the price.While talking on WhatsApp call, my voice won't go through if the other person is talking.
"
7800,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Switching from Android to an iPhone for the 1st time was an adjustment but the phone is really easy to use, camera is great, battery life very good.All in all very pleased with the iphone 12
"
7801,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
I bought this as an upgrade from iPhone 8. Love the face recognition , easy to set up from my old phone.Camera is better. And bigger screen.
"
7802,B08L5QVFCT,4,"
I moved to iphone from samsung just for camera quality. however if you are looking for best pictures, u still need to go for pro or even pro max. Before buying, i watched quite alot of youtube videos which compare the cameras and donot really find a big difference. In real life, when you put both iphone 12 and pro cameras together, it makes a difference in my personal view. Especially when it is dark, or complete opposite too bright ! So if you are buying mainly for camera and paying this money, just try yo go for pro if you can, if not, it is a great phone, great battery life, super fast... best iphone generation...
"
7803,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Came in perfect conditions. No complaints
"
7804,B08L5QVFCT,4,"
My previous phone was an iPhone X and in its case the C fitted in most of my pockets the IPhone 12 is just a little bigger and once in the wallet it does not fit in most of my pockets
"
7805,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Absolute disappointment. Never had so many issues with network connection on any devices I owned. Week mobile  reception, Wi-Fi is the worst won't connect or stay connected. Total garbage. Will sell it and never look on iphone again. Even Friking Poco F3 does better job for less than half price.
"
7806,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
I am very satisfied with this phone. For my needs it’s absolutely fine: wonderful pictures, battery life is good, easy to use!

7807,B08L5QVFCT,4,"
My old iPhone 7 broke. Bought this iPhone 12 to replace it. The colour blue is okay as expected. The bigger screen is what i wanted. Other functions are all similar to my iPhone 7, so i had no problem using it. It takes better pictures, comfortable to hold, battery life is okay so far as i turned icloud back-up off so the battery life lasts longer. I am quite happy with it.
"
7808,B08L5QVFCT,4,"
This is a replacement for my iPhone 5, which tho working fine, could no longer download apps! 🤬. Love the phone & colour & all its additions. Size is great as my eyes are not. Only downside is the keys are a bit too small & I keep hitting wrong ones.
"
7809,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Would take a photo but can’t because I’m using the phone because it’s so good! It’s apple so you should expect it to be good. Came well packed and I damaged. Came on the day it said and was perfect.
"
7810,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
It’s Apple and it’s an iPhone and as expected it’s exactly what I wanted. Face recognition is a massive improvement on using a finger.
"
7811,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
I’ve been needing to get a new phone for months and originally I was going to get an iPhone 11 but after the 11 being out of stock EVERYWHERE, I decided to buy the 12 since Amazon offered a pay-monthly scheme for it. The payments are £145.80 spread over 5 months which is really good and overall works out cheaper for me.The colour is gorgeous, the camera is excellent and overall it’s a very good phone. Really pleased :)
"
7812,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Great phone, not a fan of the lack of a headphone port
"
7813,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
My iPhone 7 was no longer keeping up so I took the plunge for a new phone. The technology is mind boggling and the device is beautiful.  Facial recognition works even in the dark making this phone even more user friendly and convenient.
"
7814,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Great phone, good price.
"
7815,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Can’t go wrong
"
7816,B08L5QVFCT,4,"
Great phone, a lot of money but they usually last long. The finishing on the back (shiny on the standard 12) is a bit annoying as it gets full of fingertips, the lack of headphones and charging brick is a joke for the money you spend.The building quality is amazing, the software is brilliant and the transition from another iPhone is amazing.
"
7817,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
I bought this for my son and I don't know the first thing about technology but I know that he wanted a iPhone so I read the reviews and decided to buy it for him off Amazon, I checked around to make sure I was paying the right price and I do trust Amazon so my thinking was if it's not what he wants I can return it and get a full refund. He loves it and says it's much better than the phone he had which isn't a iPhone but a good one nethertheless. He went for a walk and sent me the above picture on his new iphone it was getting dark and the quality is exceptional compared to his old phone. He said it's brilliant and would highly recommend it.
"
7818,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Just bought this iPhone 12 in purple beautiful phone really great price on Amazon thank you! Very easy to set up and install from your old iPhone there is definitely a difference between the iPhone 11 and this iPhone 12 well worth buying this is  my favourite iPhone and I’ve  ever owned and I’ve had iPhones  since iPhone 4 very good experience buying from Amazon as i was able to pay monthly interest free instead of outright like I’ve done previously with apple just noticed it’s 20 % off today so even more reason to buy this stunning iPhone  from apple via Amazon as far cheaper than apple store
"
7819,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Great phone and easy to use.
"
7820,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Really nice phone to be honest. Always been an android user. Slowly been moving over to apple devices elsewhere and decided for this upgrade to switch. The eco system is fantastic and the iPhone 12 just completes it. The battery life is phenomenal, I’m not glued to my phone so obviously your mileage will vary. But it always last the day and will charge to 80% to preserve the life of the battery. As I don’t require a full charge each day. Really snappy and hasn’t let me down once yet on the 3 months I’ve had it.
"
7821,B08L5QVFCT,3,"
All my Busines and family activity.I should not  have bought it. Facial recognition good. Battery life awful. Should gone for iPhone 13.
"
7822,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
I changed from an 11 Pro Max to the 12 because I like to keep up to date, even though to be honest it doesn't feel any faster because it shares the same gig mem. But I was a little tired of the weight and size of the 11 Pro Max and enjoy the smaller form factor of the 12. Though I must say I didn't see the phone in person (in an Apple store) before I purchased online, and I wouldn't call it red, more like a dark salmon in colour. If I had seen it in person first, I would have gone for another colour. But then again, after the case is on, all I see is the camera cut out.
"
7823,B08L5QVFCT,3,"
I’ve had an iPhone 6s for some years and decided to upgrade to an iPhone 12. I thought I’d notice a difference but apart from having lots of storage I’m disappointed with my new phone, nothing seems any different with it, for example battery life is still poor, downloading speed still quite slow etc, not sure it was worth the money
"
7824,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
I decided to buy a new phone as opposed to a secondhand phone, although it’s very expensive it’s what I have been using for years! Still working out how everything works!
"
7825,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
This iPhone 12 have been amazing the battery life would last even the whole day I love it only thing I dislike is that we weren’t given a proper charger
"
7826,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
iPhone 12, is a phone worth purchasing. I found it abit challenging at first not being able to find my way around the interface, however, now I have adjusted, thumbs up.Face recognition is new to me and I now find it very useful when not wearing a mask 😂. Battery life is excellent.I also like the feature were I can set it on 4G/5G.
"
7827,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
The iPhone 12 is superb it is the perfect middle of the road phone. Its updated to latest specs and software does what ever is needed.Its an excellent phone its screen is the perfect size, especially now that I just upgraded from iPhone 7. so its a world of a difference. the only issues are the price it is overpriced and the faceID which I feel is a step down from the more secure touchID and too much of a gimmick.The battery is outstanding it literally lasts all day - 2 days without recharge especially if you’re a light user!A superb all around phone.
"
7828,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
The phone is as expected.However just pray you don’t have any issues.I had issues and Amazon and Amazon’s customer service is simply shocking.You pay over £800 for a phone and have a problem within 24 hours, I expect a replacing phone not a repair!!I ended up going to the apple store in birmingham who sorted the phone.I’ll never buy an item like this from Amazon again
"
7829,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
I have been an android user since I switched from my iPhone 4 back in 2011. This design really takes me back and I’ve got to admit Apple have done a superb job here.I’ve recently used the pixel 2xl and the pixel 3a and considering google have done a really good job with their own stripped back software, for me it’s nowhere near to Apple.The iPhone 12 feels and looks premium and the iOS is a game changer compared to Android.Personally I prefer to purchase my phones out right than sign up to a 24 month contract. Depending on what sim deal you can find you could save around £400 to £600 over 2 years so it’s always worth checking.Overall it’s a great iPhone and looks fantastic in blue.!
"
7830,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Nothing new
"
7831,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
This is a perfect phone. Perfect size ,weight, smooth and elegant design. Impressive battery life for an above average user. I recommend a 256 GB. The only area I am very slightly disappointed is the screen response and touch ( typing) not bad though. I felt the phone is slightly overpriced from that perspective. I also recommend  a green one . And also,I think i phone 12 is the perfect one unless you are OK with very heavy and big phones. I felt like the money I spent on this phone is not useless.  Go ahead and get it. You will not be disappointed.
"
7832,B08L5QVFCT,4,"
Small improvement but does feel better to hold, the camera is miles ahead of the X too. Upgraded due to iphone X age had decreased perfomance, maybe hold out for next release if you are with an iphone x still
"
7833,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Having upgraded from an iPhone7 I’m absolutely loving the 12.  Have got used to facial recognition & swiping very quickly.  As always, transferring phone info over was very quick & simple.  I’ve watched a couple of YouTube videos to understand the extra/different functionality which has really helped.  Battery life is definitely much better than my 7.  All in all I’m very happy with the 12.
"
7834,B08L5QVFCT,3,"
Well its an ihpone yes. We know they hooked us on and now we are tied to the ever more expensive models. We know that Apple earns a  ... load of money with them.But to deliver the phone without any head phones at all now is mean. Its only topped by the fact that it is delivered without an operational charger either. A new cable type which would not fit into any old charger.  So please spend how much extra?Its like selling a car without tyresIt is disgraceful,  it should be illegal.
"
7835,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
I fell in love with the phone. But, my service provider couldn't facilitate eSIM. And it's very difficult to change eSIM for any emergency needs or we travel to other places and wants to use new SIM.Apple should have provided Dual Nano SIM's. eSIM's will be difficult process for everyone to get and configure it. I'm sure not even 0.5% of iPhone users are adaptive to eSIM.
"
7836,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Another year, another new iPhone and this time it is really a different from all iPhones before not only because supports 5G or of the new square design, but everything it’s new inside and out and looks and feels promising. Delivery from Amazon top notch only took 2 days. The phone itself works great, connectivity is much better than previous models and battery life is just as before, screen is crisp and colours are great, camera performance is excellent for day and night photos, stereo speakers are definitely the best of all phones I ever used,  they simply deliver immersive sound that matches cinema experience. All in all Best iPhone to date. Negative: well the price is on the higher end but we all know that.
"
7837,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Apple just keep making it easier to upgrade between their phones! The whole setup was effortless and face recognition is working well.This is the first time I’ve had an iPhone with no home button, but it’s very self explanatory and easy to use.
"
7838,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Upgraded from an iPhone 7 Plus and its so so much better. Crystal clear screen. Better cameras front and back. Face recognition is fantastic, So far battery life is excellent only having to charge at night and even then its maybe down to 40% after using a lot during the day. Wireless charging makes life easy once you have the charge pads/stands. Thought id miss the home button but No its an excellent phone.
"
7839,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
the last iphone i had was the iPhone 5SE.  I then decided to switch to android. I had two Android smartphones over the last few years, one midrange and one top range but i was increasingly feeling dissatisfied with the Android experience.i decided to upgrade to the latest iPhone and that decision has proved to be the right one.  i am very satisfied with the iPhone 12.  It is superb and thoroughly deserves to be called a smartphone.  I couldn't be more pleased with it.
"
7840,B08L5QVFCT,3,"
It is so pretty! the iphone 12’s design is so pretty in my personal opinion, it has amazing compatability with a lot of apps, the battery life seems good so far, i hope it stays like thatUpdate: Battery life has gone down so badly over the past year of having it, face ID has broken within 4-6 months of having the phone too 😐 Apple has gone downhill IMO, I've upgraded since
"
7841,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
had a old phone that was small so this one is much better because it has a bigger screen.i like apple phones so bought this one.

Is really comfortable when you hold it in your hand.in your pocket too. It has quite good camera. The battery is not that bad. I charge it once a day and is enough for me. I listen to a lot of music during the day.  This shows that it can handle daily tasks really easily.
"
7844,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Have been a Apple iPhone user for the last 10 years using a iPhone 6 which has never let me down, this upgrade to the 12 was a big step for me but after 3 weeks of using the new phone I am glad I purchased this phone it is fabulous and easy to use I would certainly recommend the iPhone 12.

Excellent, I bought this for my mom for mother's day and she is very happy with the product!
"
7846,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
It’s the first time to buy an Apple mobile phone on Amazon. I personally feel quite nervous, because I don’t know if it is really necessary to buy it on Amazon or go to the Apple store.  Start with the mobile phone, everything is normal, the quality is guaranteed and it is worth buying.

7847,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
I bought this for my wife to replace her 6S and she absolutely loves it.The camera is superb and so is the quality when watching videos on YouTube.It is a solid phone with superb features.The lack of a charger I feel is irrelevant as you can use your old chargers anyway and the battery life is a massive improvement.The lack of a headphone jack is also irrelevant to me as I bought an excellent adapter which works perfectly with wired headphones.
"
7848,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
I’d written off the idea of getting an iPhone after being disappointed with the iPhone 6 I had in the past but, after advice from family I ordered this and it’s perfect 👍
"
7849,B08L5QVFCT,3,"
The phone is great everything works fine just display is worse than on my iPhone 6s. A little yellowish. I was thinking to return it back but after I watched many videos on YouTube I decided to keep it as many people has similar problem. First time disappointed by Apple quality. Apple saying there’s nothing wrong with display it’s tuned by factory to yellowish tint and it’s still within specifications
"
7850,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
The only thing against this phone is my face's ability to either mute the sound or facetime someone mid-call.Apart from that battery life is excellent, face recognition is a real plus, and everything else works as well as you would expect an Apple product to.
"
7851,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
I’ve always been an android user however this year I decided to treat myself to this Apple iPhone and it has not disappointed me wish I made the switch sooner.
"
7852,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
My 8th iPhone and I couldn’t be happier. Got it at a good price. Purple is actually really nice. And it was £20 cheaper than the other colours.
"
7853,B08L5QVFCT,3,"
£750 overheats after playing cod for more than 30 mins, even with graphics set to low and frame rate set to medium. It may be graphically 40% faster but only when not playing games especially COD. Game plays better on a Samsung s8 which is 5 years old. Very very disappointed with playing games on this massively overpriced, over hyped iPhone.
"
7854,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Really substantial upgrade from my iPhone 8, which was already a fantastic piece of kit. Just miss the sleek, more compact profile of my old phone too... this one is chunky in comparison. Having said that, the battery life, camera and screen blow the iPhone 8 out of the water. It really is effortless to take great shots with these two cameras! The screen is just fantastic. Feels solid, which is good because it is going to be with me for a few years yet given how overpriced these things are.
"
7855,B08L5QVFCT,1,"
Bad experience getting this phone from amazon.  Call started to drop after a year. Amazon products support did not help keeping telling me the stuff which is common i.e restart the phin. Turn the aeroplane mode and then off etc. I have got the phone which doesn't work and have paid full price for it. Should have gone to Apple directly 🙄.
"
7856,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Bought this on Amazon. Great price compared with competitors. Great phone.
"
7857,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Excellent phone no problems easy to set up
"
7858,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Fantastic phone.  Went from iPhone 7 to this one and never looking back even though I loved my 7.  Would not have any other product than Apple simply the best.  So easy to use and everything just went from one phone to this other with no sweat or swearing!
"
7859,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
I’ve just upgraded from an iPhone 6 to this iPhone 12. Really pleased with it, very easy to use and very light. I am bias as I do prefer apple products to android.
"
7860,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Wonderful product and genuine without a doubt
"
7861,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
It arrived the next day. The phone is slightly smaller than my old iPhone 8 Plus but it fits better in my hand now. The resolution is visibly better, not quite used to the face recognition yet but I’m sure I will get the hang of it
"
7862,B08L5QVFCT,4,"
Coming from an old ‘window’ based phone, I found the iPhone great to use.. although not as intuitive to set up or find my way around.
"
7863,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Great phone. Snappy sharp and feels like good high-end quality. I really like it. It’s actually a perfect screen size for functionality in all senses for everyone. Not too big, and not too small, perfect for general use; browsing, Instagram, etc and brilliant OLED screen for Netflix with support for Dolby Vision. It is bright and responsive and fast in all conditions, including sunlight viewing. Do genuinely recommend, even though it’s a bit pricey.
"
7864,B08L5QVFCT,5,"

 The appearance of the iphone 12 series has changed alot this time,the camera has also been enchanced a lot.The calculation and software have improved a lot, which is really great.especially the night shot taking is really good you can feel it on the screen,its tough level.If you are pursuing excellent camera functions and like Apple highly integrated ecological chain,then iphone 12 series is a very good choice and the choice will not make u regret it.Sending by my iphone12🥰🥰
"
7866,B08L5QVFCT,4,"
Overall the IPhone 12 is a great phone bug like most apple products, you pay more for the apple logo on the back than the technology itself.
"
7867,B08L5QVFCT,4,"
Used product to get 5G , before this phone I use to have I phone x not much differenceThanks
"
7868,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Very clear picture and comprises incredible features, very nice with long life battery.
"
7869,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
I am an Apple devotee, so, perhaps, slightly biased. As with all of the Apple products I have owned, superbly well made. Works and integrates with my other Apple products. Technology as it should be, in my view. One criticism, battery life could be better, but, I do get by with one charge per day.
"
7870,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Had it for two days now, used it constantly and only had to charge it once! I got in it purple and it’s really pretty, not too big which is nice and with a lot of nice features.
"
7871,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Bought this as soon as the iphone 13 was released because I knew the price would drop on the 12 and they would sell out quick. I was right.  Bought for a christmas present so haven't opened it.
"
7872,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
My last phone A Siemens M60 20+ yo on same battery served me well and is still working but buttons starting to stick This is a replacement and obviously things have moved on needed a push to upgrade (family) but got my own back by getting them to tutor me in its use
"
7873,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Easy to set up and well described
"
7874,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Easy to use.  This is my first iPhone in over ten years and it’s lovely to use.  Takes amazing pictures.  Face ID - wow.  It just works.  Amazing.  Love the colour.After using this for a few days I’m not really sure I’ll go back to android
"
7875,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
This is definitely the best iPhone I've owned and I've had them all since the iPhone 4 great build quality great battery life the screen looks amazing the stereo speakers are great too. The iPhone 12 doesn't come with charger or headphones which is a little disappointing but I use a wireless charger anyway so it didn't bother me . I usually go with product red but it looked a bit orange this year so got the blue version and I'm glad I did it looks stunning
"
7876,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Great everyday phone. One of the best iPhone I have had and used not to talk about the camera quality it’s absolutely great quality and battery life.
"
7877,B08L5QVFCT,4,"
Got this for my wife for Christmas and she's enjoyed using it so far.However as a Samsung Galaxy S fan, I must say that a 60fps screen is a bit strange for flagship tier phones in 2020/21.
"
7878,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Love this phone and all my information took juts few minutes to go over this new phone I was pretty relieved I had visions of losing my music and photos I bought the white and I love it
"
7879,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
I love the way the phone itself is very colourful and I love all of the features including the face recognition and the layout of the apps is great. I absolutely love the screen size and it is just the right size to fit in your pocket
"
7880,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Amazing
"
7881,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Amazing phone, great looking and easy to use. Camera is also top quality. My first iPhone, always been a android guy but this has been a breath of fresh air and a good change.
"
7882,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
The Iphone12 is the best of the Iphones so far but the price is expensive ! However buying a sim free phone is cheaper in the long run as your not tied in on any contract! I am very happy with this phone you can do so much with it !
"
7883,B08L5QVFCT,3,"
Frankly it was not much of an improvement on my IPhone 7, which my wife now has. The challenge of transferring data is far worse than the Apple solution suggests as it does not transfer music not bought from Apple. In addition, the developers seem to live in their own world which assumes that users are all geeks.
"
7884,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Brilliant iPhone with great features and so lightweight

Highly satisfied although needed to buy new power plug and need to get ear buds
"
7888,B08L5QVFCT,3,"
My another iPhone ... I have to say it's below expectations battery so weak som app lag , yes nice design good photos but again display so dark in day light so so waste money hopefully my kid will won't for professional user wrong choice .
"
7889,B08L5QVFCT,3,"
Good
"
7890,B08L5QVFCT,4,"
Not very good sound compared to Dolby on android but it is half the price of a top Samsung galaxy.Also could do with clearer display a bit of a let down but some apps are better and cheap for a 5 g mobile
"
7891,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
cool!!!!
"
7892,B08L5QVFCT,1,"
Rip off. As has been said before, the lack of a charger is a total scam from Apple. Yes, Apple, you are reducing your carbon footprint and all that, but at the same time you are also making a tonne more revenue from accessory sales. If it was a genuine move, you'd supply a voucher code entitling buyers to order a charger for free. And the design to include a USB C cable? I mean what wall sockets have USB C? None. Who has a tonne of USB A power adaptors knocking around? Everyone. Simply including a cable that connects the phone to USB A would alleviate this issue, but no Apple in their wisdom assumes USB C is fine.I have  Macbook Pro which is generally fine and a phone could plug into that to charge, but I bought the phone for my teenage son. He'd never have an previous adaptor to use. I saw the light and switched to Samsung S series phones years ago. So his birthday present was almost useless out of the box - I wasn't even offered an upsell to get a charger at time of sale. I anticipate alot of moaning  in the coming days as he slowly starts to realise other short comings of this overpriced phone, but for me the no charger/USB C cable thing is a complete joke. AVOID!
"
7893,B08L5QVFCT,3,"
5G on and off, used usb leads to charge which made sound muted, phone keep going headphones mode despite no headphones were attached. Requires phone to restart. Did not find Apple standard except the price which was as high as for Apple products.
"
7894,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
The set up I had to do twice so make sure you update your old iPhone first. No instructions in box but lots of hints on phone. Took a while to work stuff out.
"
7895,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Everything about this phone is easy and very classy. It looks so very nice, easy to use, and a simple process transferring from one phone to another. I would recommend it to anyone.

 I bought this for my dad's birthday , the product description suggested its a ""New iPhone 12 128GB"", however it arrived in a brown Amazon box with bubble wraps inside. It didn't come with the official apple boxing and I have checked the serial number it was a refurbished iPhone.Won't recommend, this is not a brand new iPhone.
"
7898,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
I was impressed with the delivery service, the phone arrived within 24hrs. Xfer of data from my iphone 6 was easy. Good phone at reasonable price.
"
7899,B08L5QVFCT,1,"
I purchased this for 650 which is the same as apple store price for a new iPhone. This was advertised as new. However in the confirmation email it said old- like new. Battery life 98%. I immediately cancelled the delivery.
"
7900,B08L5QVFCT,3,"
Okay - lots of good stuff: great camera, great speakers, amazing screen etc.  But one huge flaw: one of the points of upgrading to 5G is that you should be able to ditch your wifi (provided you're in a 5G area).  But, you can't, and here's why: you cannot back up your phone using 5G.  This makes no sense, as 5G is often faster than wifi.  So, that means I can't cancel my wifi that's costing me £35 a month - just to back up my iPhone!
"
7901,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
It does what is written in the description.
"
7902,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
I love this phone , the photo quality and edits are amazing.
"
7903,B08L5QVFCT,2,"
I never write reviews on amazon, this is my first but I felt it was necessary as the iPhone 12 is an expensive product and I had high expectations for it. Undoubtedly Apple will launch and revision but for those of you who are thinking of buying this product, perhaps wait until everyone else who has ""tested"" this product for apple and exposed the bugs have helped refine the next version.Here are the issues I am experiencing:- Phone network reception just drops sporadically and does not restore itself, you need to restart the phone- Copy and paste does not work- The face recognition is not user friendly due to face masks or sunglasses, the thumb reader would be better under the circumstancesIf any of the above is a concern for you, consider something else.
"
7904,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Getting to know my way around it having had android phones....wi fi reception good and battery life great.

I am still learning how to find the various features. Would appreciate an operating manual.
"
7907,B08L5QVFCT,4,"
Excellent product. Slightly pricey as normal but I prefer Apple products. 5G is incredible. Faster than my home cable broadband. Just need wider coverage now.
"
7908,B08L5QVFCT,4,"
Bought as a present, recipient very happy.
"
7909,B08L5QVFCT,5,"

Very happy with iPhone also safe
"
7911,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
I was hesitant at first with the price.I have always had Samsung mobiles but decided to buy Apple this time and what a excellent hand set this is.The operating system and performance it gives that’s why it’s one of the best iPhones on the market.
"
7912,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Easy to setup and so many more facilities available on this version to my previous phone. Good buy and price comparison matches any other companies.

the best...

"
7924,B08L5QVFCT,1,"
I decided to upgrade from iPhone XR recently to IPhone 12, as I was led to believe the iPhone 12 had battery life/efficiency.Normal use on my previous IPhone XR would take my battery life up to late evening from a full charge the previous night, which I was more than happy with.Same charge on this IPhone 12 from Amazon gets me to about lunchtime. Totally disappointed in this product to say the least.  I’ve lost all confidence in purchasing from Amazon.I was led to believe the iPhone 12 had a so much better battery efficiency which was the reason of my purchase/upgrade.I can only assume this ‘new’ phone is a refurbished phone that no one else wanted and /or returned.I’m actually trying to finish this review before the battery runs out.  I kid you not.If I could give this review zero stars I would.Note to self==========Always go straight to Apple for Apple products, especially with the costs involved.  Never going to Amazon again for Apple products.

Replacement for iphone8. Took a bit of time to get used to different controls - eg no home button, but now love it. Combined with ios14 so easy to use. The only problem is it won’t recognise my face when I have a face mask on!
"
7928,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
iPhones are so easy to use the battery life is good  pleased with purchase
"
7929,B08L5QVFCT,1,"
Let me repeat, it didn't last 1, single, solitary week.Not 1.It didn't last 3 days.It lasted... 2... kinda.Galway through the second it started turning off with no warning.No problem, I'll just send it back... nah... Amazon don't like that. It's been over a month. I've talked to Amazon support more times in that period than I'd like to admit, more than I have to my grandparents. And they refuse to issue a refund. So, I have paid eight hundred pounds for the oh so enviable opportunity to peruse the Amazon support pages and struggle with their support team.The phone is probably fine but, and I can't stress this enough:DO NOT BUY THIS FROM AMAZON!Buy it from someone who accepts in person returns, like Apple or Curry's.AVOID AMAZON'S CUSTOMER SUPPORT AT ALL (and I do mean ALL) COSTS!
"
7930,B08L5QVFCT,5,"

Great discounts price on Amazon! New iPhone 12 for a discount of £200 from the original price.

Upgraded from an iPhone 7 to the 12, so glad I did. The difference is like night and day.  If you’re looking to upgrade from an older iPhone, go for it.

I like this minty phone. I liked my dead iPhone 7. The face recognition is surprisingly good. I tried lots of different grimaces and it’s not fooled. Far far too expensive but otherwise a minty treat.

Bought this phone from Amazon on Prime Day - from a market place 3rd party seller sold 'via Amazon' and sadly discovered the phone had a 3rd party camera added to the phone and then sold as brand new.How do we know? - Apple confirmed that the serial number of the camera was not a genuine Apple camera serial number when they ran diagnostics and so this phone camera will never work and this iPhone was corrupted despite being sold as brand new boxed and wrapped. I will never buy an Apple phone or high-value phone from Amazon but only from the direct Apple shop - in the future. I would advise anyone to proceed with caution after my experience.Amazon has refunded me the cost of this phone.  Amazon is as always, excellent for their customer service so 5* for Amazon!  I am sorry that Amazon has such tricky sellers using their platform. It damages their reputation.

The phone developed a hardware fault within 30 days,contacted Amazon and was asked to return the phone for repair,almost 3 weeks later it was returned to me still in the same condition,took it to Apple which I should have done in the first place and it was repaired within the hourHave to say Amazon’s handling of this has been appalling I won’t be purchasing any more Apple products anytime soon
"
8083,B08L5QVFCT,1,"
After less than 3 months the screen suddenly died. It’s now unusable and I’m told I need to spend £280 to get it fixed. Apparently the screen isn’t covered by the warranty. Absolutely disgusting, I’ll never buy another Apple product again. Not fit for purpose

We upgrade our phones so you can expect better speed, better camera and better network, however, believe me, there is no difference whatsoever from iPhone 11 to 12, I have the disconnection issue since day one and its just worse than the iPhone 11I have found no speed difference with this upgrade and I have found that 11 camera is even better than 12 !!!  what is going on with Apple, they are just giving us the same old things in a new package !

Brand new phone, neary £700, it hardly holds a charge and takes 20 minutes to charge 5%.Apple checked the phone and said they would have provided a refund if I'd purchased with them, but as it's over 30 days old and I bought via Amazon, I'm offered the option of a 'repair'.Brand new phone, hardly used, needs to be repaired.I will never, ever buy an Apple product via Amazon again.

I recently purchased iphone 12 128 GB from amazon. I was excited to have this phone as it looks amazing and feels awesome in hand. However, Its battery doesn't lasted more than 4 hours of screen time. I am not sure if its just with me. I return this item to amazon and after 12 Days of returning this item finally I got my refund.I am disappointed with Iphone12 battery and amazon return service.
"
8101,B08L5QVFCT,1,"
Unfortunately, the box came opened, and there were signs of it having been used.  Returned easily though.
"
8102,B08L5QVFCT,1,"
ok
"
8103,B08L5QVFCT,1,"
The volume down button stopped working after two months. The whole phone crashed after 4 months. Never ever buying a phone from Amazon again. I want my money back, what's the warranty policy?

8104,B08L5QVFCT,2,"
Mixing colourTurning on and off from time to timeIt was a waste of timeI returned product
"
8105,B08L5QVFCT,1,"
Bought this expensive phone, kept freezing. Within 1 month it failed completely and it seems you don’t get a refund but a repair which can take 2 weeks. Had to buy another phone and now have no confidence in the iPhone 12 and would rather have had a refund.
"
8106,B08L5QVFCT,2,"
I thought I would upgrade from my XS Max to the iPhone 12. But I found out I had actually downgraded. I wouldn't go this route again.
"
8107,B08L5QVFCT,1,"
The problem is Amazon delivery .. they say next day delivery but in fact you will never know. Their drivers play hide & seek .. very unreliable. My advise buy from a decent outlet .. not Amazon.
"
8108,B08L5QVFCT,1,"
Phone arrived quickly.  After a few days the phone shut down and would not power back up.  Tried restart procedure but nothing so requested a return.  Item was returned with proof of postage on 28th June and still awaiting a refund.
"
8109,B08L5QVFCT,1,"
I bought it 2-3 months ago but now the battery life decreased from 100% to 99%.
"
8110,B08L5QVFCT,1,"
The signal drops out constantly when I’m trying to make calls and the internet looses its signal too. Keep needed to restart the phone which for the amount payed it is laughable.
"
8111,B08L5QVFCT,1,"
The screen quality and battery life is not as good as the XR. Also, so many qliches and freezing that the xR never had.I’d go for the xR or 11 for a cheaper price and not an oled screen.
"
8112,B08L5QVFCT,1,"
I was highly surprised that Amazon would hide information about warranty on the listing page for iPhones bought from Amazon Warehouse.Also, an iPhone which is in ""Very Good"" condition could be a renewed one!!!
"
8113,B08L5QVFCT,1,"
Do not buy, it’s not a new phone 12, arrived with the iPhone packaging removed, asked Amazon to sort it our told I have to wait three weeks don’t waste your money
"
8114,B08L5QVFCT,1,"
Phone arrived cracked and chipped. Took ages to sort out with amazon. Not worth the hassle. Should have bought from somewhere with a better reputation.

The seller does not indicate the region of manufacture. The one i ordered was manufactured in Canada, which is why I can't loyalty cards to Apple Pay in the UK. My credit card works fine, so I have no complaints.
"
8125,B08L5QVFCT,1,"
Phone quality is no better than Cheaper brands. Waste of money
"
8126,B08L5QVFCT,1,"
It’s a great phone but it packed in working after 16 months - 4 months out of warranty. Apple want £465 to fix it even though they haven’t opened it to see what’s wrong. I’m hoping Amazon replace it under their 2 year warranty or I’ll have to invoke my consumer protection rights. £750 is a lot of money for something that stopped working after less than 2 years. Cosmetically it’s 100%. Not dropped or wet.Just waiting for Amazon to get back to my son, who bought me it as a special present.Gutted!

This phone i have only had a day and i have seen vast improvements to the older version of this phone and arguably the building blocks for this phone the iPhone 11. I bought the iPhone 11 and it was the replacement to my old iPhone XR. after having this phone for the short while i have the phone i have seen many aspects which make the upgrade worth it. This iPhone for starters has 5G and the phone also has a better chip. This Iphone has a new technology called super retina XDR display and this display is much better than the ones on the XR and 11 as they didn't even have the same pixel density as the iPhone 6! the other improvement is the the curved edges and this may sound like a weird point. However the phone is better looking and is more grippy to your hand, it also makes the phone feel newer as the older phones had slight curves in the screen which now look outdated. The sound quality is about the same as the 11 with stereo speakers. The next thing to point out is the bold colour choices, you can get plain white or black but there is also a purple, blue, green and red edition as well. I picked the blue colour and it is like a deep impact blue to the like of the blue you see many fords painted in the UK. The red is a slight salmon colour and you will think the phone is quite coral. the green is nice and looks minty. However the purple is a candy floss like colour and is a bold choice. However i don't think you will regret buying the purple one!. The last point of my review is the storage option and the base amount is 64GB and this is not enough if you have a lot of music and photos and apps then you will want the 128GB version at an extra £50 to the base model. if you are a hardcore Iphone user and feel as if you need 256GB of storage then my advice would be not to buy the basic 12 and get the Pro or pro max and get the upgraded storage option. Yes you will pay a bit more however you will not regret it as the pro and the pro max add a ton more features and have the more classy stainless steel bands and have 3 cameras. So thats my advice hope it helps!

I've always had cheaper Android phones, never wanted to spend Apple money. Not against the brand, but I don't like having expensive kit in my pocket. (I've had an old apple Ipad for years, so I'm not scared of Apple). Anyway, more recently I upgraded from a Huawei p20 lite - a £200 phone) to an Iphone 11, mainly driven by the better camera and thought It’s about time I treated myself to something a little more expensive, as I've never broken or lost a phone in my pocket.2 Weeks in and I'm still getting frustrated, I just can’t do the things I would expect from a phone!My main gripes are:*I have 25 Gb of photos on my Android, I just want to move them over. I don’t want my photos on the cloud, I have enough backups. I just want them physically on the iPhone. it seems the latest ios has blocked direct transfer from Windows (I can see the file, just cant paste to it). All other routes are extremely painful. Just let me drag and drop please!!!*Same goes in reverse – considering the main reason I bought the phone was for the camera. I own my photos, why can’t I just easily take them off my phone. I don’t want them in the cloud, I don’t want them hidden when I delete them. I want direct access to my own files please.*This was my first IPhone, so I was expecting the transition to be nice. Open the box and no USB adapter??? There is a USB C lead, but who has a USB C charger? All my wall plates around the house are USB A. My car is USB A. My PC is USB A. great, so I need to spend another £20 to use my phone, and another £20 updating all my leads in my car, at work etc.*To the above point, why isn’t this just a USB C standard?*If transferring photos is difficult, everything else seems impossible. Absolutely no visibility of folder structure in windows.*The phone is bulkier and a lot heavier than my P30 lite, and so far I haven't seen anything to benefit the extra mass or bulk.I really wanted to love this phone, but so far all I want to do is just return it and go back to my old phone which is 1/3 of the price.

Finally upgraded from iPhone 6s. Loving the speed, the screen, the camera’s Bokeh feature. Great phone. Bought it from John Lewis. To my disappointment they further reduced the price 2 days later. BUT I discovered they actually price match themselves and they gave me a refund of the difference - no quibbles. Excellent!
"
8132,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Love this new phone. Not had an apple iPhone before. It’s easy to use still learning about it but delighted with it so far.
"
8133,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
My first iPhone since the iPhone 6, so far I am very happy with it. Coming from android I was happy with the The user layout. It is very intuitive and easy to navigate the build quality of the phone is very sturdy and light but so light it’s at risk of feeling “cheap”. This is really nitpicking. The phone’s snappy response means all tasks I throw at it are carried out smoothly and effortlessly.Bad points: no charger is a pain in the backside! Not having a usb c powerbrick to hand meant I had to revert to an old iPad charger I luckily had. Why they went for a lightning port to usb C I will never know as it is the most pointless and least available connection. (At least to me) I have now swapped back to a lightning to usb 2.0 and normality is restored (yes the charging is not as fast anymore) overall a good purchase in my opinion but I might not be able to say the same If I was coming from an iPhone 11 or similar.Overall, a good phone to consider if you are due an upgrade or like me have an older phone dying a horrid death! I’m sure there’s others out there who will say Android is better and to be quite honest I believe both have their flaws and benefits.

Ignore the reviews from people who haven’t bought one, that’s laughable. Yes the phone doesn’t come with headphones or a power plug but it’s hard to believe you would really need another power plug if you’re in the market for this phone. Just wasted plastic at this point. Having said that I did upgrade to a usb-c power plug and it charges from dead to full in 1hr 30 and fast charges to 50% in 30 minutes, the battery also holds charge a lot longer than a phone you’re likely to be upgrading from like an old 7, 8, X. The most impressive feature is the camera with night mode and wide angle. The Oled screen is also stunning especially if you turn the lights off and watch a Dolby vision video. This will be the phone that people own for 5+ years without needing an upgrade. When you think the iPhone X was released at £1000, this is a much more refined product and coming in £200 cheaper.

Absolutely love this phone and have no issues with the product itself. Word of warning though: if you don't own an Apple computer, you will need to purchase additional accessories separately. The lightning cable included in the box has a USB-C connector which can't be plugged into a standard Windows PC or plug from an older iPhone model.

First time I switched from samsung to iphone because my sister gifted me an iphone and it was the worst experience. Very rubbish phone. Android phones are so easy to use. Totally worthless.

Scam!!!!!!!!!!Do not buy unless you are ready to get a really bad phone.bought it yesterday it has arrived and the screen was smashed, scratches all on the back and all on the side.didn’t even come with a charger or anything.stay clear do not buy.

Better than I thought was a little weary about buying phones on markets like these. Had a bad experience. This phone is brilliant comes in original sealed package and once activated gives you option for AppleCare which is awesome.

Upgrading from the XR you see the difference between  4g and 5G. Overall the design on the apps and UI (user interface ) feels nicer to the eye and more snappy the oled screen is great for dark gritty films. Despite its price and apples ups and downs with privacy and god knows what else the phone delivers on many fronts however the worst part of the product lies with the battery. I hope one day I could make my battery last a week without a charge, I don’t use it too much and it lasts roughly 3 days but while at work I have to charge it every morning

I had struggled along for a while with my old 6s. Big mistake. Bought the twelve after reading all the reviews of 11-13.  Very easy to set up from cloud. Love the magnetic cordless charging. Battery life seems endless compared to old phone. I do lots of calls,emails and SMS/WhatsApp messages and calls. Don't use camera that much. Great phone.

Just upgraded from X, just another brilliant phone by Apple, great design, fast and super light. I love the colour (blue) unique. It’s a pity that there is no adapter included but I have so many brand new chargers in their wraps from my past iPhones that I never used, so no problem at all.
"
8157,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Didn’t like the price but who does lol. Love the phone, great functionality, good size to see/hold and crystal clear screen etcMost people who buy these have already looked up the spec so I won’t go into that side, but I do know you will enjoy using this beautiful phone and all it’s features.There are some cheaper very good phones out there, but I like the reliability of Apple phones and they are always in good enough working condition to pass down to grandchildren when you upgrade

The iPhone 12 is the best iv had to date the quality of the graphics in games and the battery life is a lot better so would definitely recommend.

It was time to retire my 6s after many years of loyal service.I kept waiting for Apple to bring the fingerprint back but as it wasn’t happening got this one.Great phone otherwise but the face recognition doesn’t work half the time. It’s a problem in the shops, in the dark, when wearing a hat and sunglasses and sometimes just for no reason at all. Please bring back the fingerprint!Why Apple and not Samsung or any other phone brand? Cause of security! And because they stand up to Facebook and other companies that want your private data to sell you more stuff and make money off of you! Google for example should give their phones to people for free seeing how much they “spy” on their users.

I am an iPhone user and I’ve had iPhones since the 3G version many, many years ago.This is my 1st with an OLED screen. For me personally, iPhones have gotten a bit chunky over the last few years and have gotten thicker each year since the 6 and 6S.The iPhone 12 is only 7.4mm thick with a super glossy 6.1“ screen which reminds me of the iPhone 4 with its straight aluminium sides and for me it’s perfect.I have small hands and this is probably a little bit big for me to use comfortably but I think that 6.1” is the perfect size screen for trolling the net and using Safari so I’ll put up with having to use 2 hands every now and then.The battery is comparable to the XR I had previously and the blue colour matches my Apple Watch 6 perfectly.I bought the 128gb version to help with resale prices next year but 64GB for me would have been enough as I still have 102gb free after 2 months use. (As a guide I have 79 songs, 3 videos and 169 photos, I’m certainly not a heavy user! )If you are reading this and are thinking of buying one, the iPhone 13 will be out in a few months and it’s expected to have a slightly faster processor and a different camera arrangement and new colours. It may be the 12S, it may be the 13, but in my opinion you can always miss a year out.This phone is well made, takes great photos and has a sublime screen with iMessage as well as 5G (which I’ve tried using O2) and the benefit of the best App Store in the world. Buy it and enjoy the Apple experience.

 I have an iphone 11 and am very happy with it, I purchased an iphone 12 for my wife as a Birthday present and have been comparing the 2 phones, I really like feel of the iphone 11 which is an aluminium frame the iphone 12 does not have the same premium feel, it is a lot lighter in the hand, the 11 has rounded edges whereas the 12 has flat.Speed wise using you cannot tell a difference, we are both using 4G, when my wife changes her contract and opts for one with 5G her smartphone will be a lot faster.Both smartphones outperform the cheaper brands when receiving text messages, and Whatsapp and also email messages.

8166,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
With modern technology you can do so much. This phone even though it's not the latest one has all the tech stuff you need. I'm not going to explain everything it can do but what's described in the description part is what it can do. A good phone.

Bought for my son he is really pleased with it

8168,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
A fantastic product to use. Data transfer was a breeze. Battery life is excellent. A couple of minor glitches in software which I am sure will be fixed in future releases e.g. during a WhatsApp video call if you toggle between screens then video keeps dimming after every few seconds.
"
8169,B08L5QVFCT,1,"
I don’t  know what's going on with my iphone. Some apps stop working normally for a few minutes and today, out of nowhere it was running half a screen for a few seconds and restarted alone. However, I want a new device and not have it repaired because I bought it on March 24th. I await answers and that my problem is solved. Thanks.

iPhone 12 is so easy to open using face recognition , compared with the iPhone 7 with finger print opening , which never works!
"
8177,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Great phone, amazing screen and just easy to use. Best feature of iPhones is the software and all the integrations with Apple products. I personally would have liked a bigger battery as it goes down relatively fast when using 5g during the day. But overall I must admit that for the average user (me) iPhone never lets you down.

"
8186,B08L5QVFCT,1,"
Overpriced hype. Can’t see any difference between this and the iPhone 8. Not worth upgrading or maybe try Samsung. I think I will.
"
8187,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
There are plenty of reviews for iPhone 12's out there so I'll stick to the Amazon experience. The price undercuts purchasing direct. One day later I got a SIM-free iPhone 12 in the branded box ready to stick my own SIM straight in. Worked like a dream and I spent less than buying direct - especially as I was happy to get the blue as it was a bit cheaper for some reason (but who cares when it spends all its life in a case!).
"
8188,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Needed to update my phone and choose this.
"
8189,B08L5QVFCT,5,"
Apple prices are always high in comparison with other iPhones, and Apple is mean with supplying essential accessories, like charging connectors. However, this is made up ( I think ), by quality, design and after sales service as well as providing at east 5 years of critical updates.

Phone was perfect. Only moan was battery at 85% of full workng capacity, but what did I expect with a renewed device eh!
"
8204,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
I bought this as I wanted a phone that was smaller and I am loving it apart from the battery being a little on the low side it more than makes up for it in how pristine the body is very fab phone.
"
8205,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
I've ordered a number of renewed iPhones. They are brilliant. By and large they are as described. But I've had a couple of issues. They just take them back, no quibbles, no issues, and issue a refund. So there's no risk.The first iPhone 12 we received had a column of defective pixels. Went straight back. The next arrived and in absolute mint condition, not a mark in sight, everything working as new, with a 92% battery health. Perfect.Seriously worth buying these considering the savings you make.
"
8206,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
I decided to return phone and get a more up to date one. That said the phone was excellent. I didn’t have it long enough to judge battery life etc. My money was returned promptly. I am very pleased and would buy from them again.
"
8207,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
I’ve never bought a refurbished phone before but will definitely do so again. The phone is in pristine condition with 98% battery health. Really pleased with this purchase

8208,B08PCCZMMR,4,"
As new condition, great battery life and no problems with the phone. Very pleased.

Excellent quality, delivered quickly. Very happy with my purchase
"
8211,B08PCCZMMR,4,"
I bought a phone in excellent condition.  Back on the screen is scratched, which is very visible.  Front Screen without scratches.  The battery is 87%, which disappointed me a lot.  Also, the phone came without a charger and in the tiny box it looks like a letter.
"
8212,B08PCCZMMR,4,"
I bought this as a second phone for travelling and I almost can’t fault it. Perfect condition (true to description) no scratches, nicks, nothing at all so very happy about that. Everything seems perfect with it functionally so far and I’ll edit this if anything changes. Only thing is it seems like the battery dies faster than it should. It has 86% battery health but if I’m actively using it, it dies fast than my 80% XR. Not a drastic difference but noticeable. Still very good value for money!
"
8213,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
I was a bit sceptical when ordering a renewed phone but I have been very pleased with my purchase and would have no hesitation in recommending, the phone was advertised as excellent condition but I can honestly say it looks brand new.
"
8214,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
Was umming and arring about buying a renewed phone online when you can’t see it beforehand but I decided to take a punt and see what happens and I’m glad I did. Phone was in mint condition no scratches or damage to the body or screen at all. Battery was 89% but that’s more than enough considering the price. If your debating buying I’d say it’s worth whatever risk is involved and if your not happy with the condition you can always send it back.
"
8215,B08PCCZMMR,3,"
So I paid £397 for a iPhone 12 in “excellent “ condition. I must admit I was a little nervous buying a second hand phone unseen as I had never done it before but it is a Christmas present for my son so went ahead. When I received it there is a very obvious long scratch down the centre of the face and several smaller scratches on face of phone. The battery life is 87%. I was going to return it but at this time of year did not want the hassle. I would not buy this kind of purchase online again I’m afraid. I took it into our local mobile shop who concurred it was not “excellent”
"
8216,B08PCCZMMR,4,"
Phone arrived quickly and was as described. However no charging lead and plug suitable for the phone (they had included a Samsung charger but we had purchased an iphone). Contacted amazon as was an amazon renewed product and they passed me to a 3rd party. I expect amazon to deal with amazon renewed product issues but alas not. 3rd party was pleasant and resolved issue quickly. Overall did take shine off the purchase somewhat though.
"

8224,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
Ordered my Iphone 12 on Tuesday afternoon and crossed my fingers that the phone that arrived would be in good condition. Delivered on Wednesday evening and I can honestly say it's no different to a brand new Iphone. Not a mark on it and the battery health is at 90%To say I'm pleased with my purchase is and understatement. When you can get Iphones as pristine as this it makes no sense to pay near to or over £1000.00 for a new one!!I have no hesitation is recommending going down this route to anyone who, like me, wants a new phone but not the costs associated.Brilliant service!!

I bought my device from the Mazuma mobile. It came in a generic box with a generic usb-a cable and needle. No papers or original accessories. Device was functional.There were 2 issues with the device but they helped me for both:- The item was not the same as the description (there were some scratches). After my complaint, they ordered a small refund.- 2 months later, the phone's IMEI blacklisted and cellular network stopped. After my complaint, they said the issue is related with the previous customer of the phone. Reportedly they contacted with previous customer and blacklist removed.So, customer service was responsive. However, you should check everything and be a conscious customer.

I had used iPhones since they were first released and loved them from day one. Last year I purchased a Samsung (great phones) but I never mastered the little differences in OS so took a chance on a refurbed iPhone 12. Best thing I've purchased in a while purchased via Amazon, came next day fab condition, couldn't fault it and I'm forensic. Great deal too boot.

Phone looks great, came in what I thought was really good condition.Only use phone mostly for messaging partner and Google maps.Came to realise that the camera is useless. Can’t zoom in on anything very blurry. Doesn’t seem to focus properly, so can’t use video either.Not very impressed, wish I’d bought new.

Was scared it would be bad quality but it’s very good!!
"
8244,B08PCCZMMR,3,"
Phone arrived quickly but it had no fragile markers on the package and had been pushed through the letterbox onto a stone floor. Fortunately it didn't break.There are a lot of scratches on the screen for a product described in 'as new' condition, and a few chips to the body. The charge cable supplied is not Apple so time will tell how long it lasts. 88% battery health is a little lower than I'd have liked, though it shouldn't be an issue. The phone was not supplied in its original box and did not include any instructions or other information that would normally be supplied with a new phone. Otherwise the phone is fully functional and as desired.The voucher was a nice surprise too!
"
8245,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
Item as described, no marks etc, good battery life.
"
8246,B08PCCZMMR,3,"
I know it’s a rendition phone but there were problems with it like the screen had a orange tinge on the side and when starting up there was a yellow bar across the top of the screen. That would have bugged me.
"
8247,B08PCCZMMR,4,"
This phone is lighter than my previous XR model, face recognition pretty good. Battery time is still a bit of downer for me as it runs out quick. Cable that came with it, was not particularly great as it is already broken. Overall a great phone, great specs , camera brilliant. Love this mint green colour.

8250,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
iPhone 12 exactly as described. Had no scratches and everything worked as new. 98% battery health is really good. To my surprise I like the notch and haven’t missed Touch ID at all. Face ID works well.I preferred the telephoto and standard aspect on the iPhone 8 Plus to the normal and wide on this phone but the image quality is a step up again.I think my Apple Watch drains more quickly with this phone than the 8 Plus, but I do have an original Apple Watch, so that’s probably why.The box from loop mobile protected it well and had everything I needed in it. It may not be an original Apple box, but apart from the initial opening of it when does it matter?Arrived earlier than it said it would, I would look to order from Loop again, maybe a newer Apple Watch…

8253,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
Phone arrived early and packaged well not a scratch in sight looks like new really happy great job would recommend to anyone.

8254,B08PCCZMMR,4,"
My title says it all, how can a business be so unprofessional? There was no original box just a white cardboard box, and there was scratches everyone on the phone.
"
8255,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
Very good value, almost as good as new, couple of very small scratches and battery 90%, but lot cheaper than new one, would recommend.

8256,B08PCCZMMR,2,"
Christmas present for my daughter. All seems to work ok, but definitely not excellent condition. Screen is cracked and lots of knocks evident around the camera with what appear to be chips on camera glass. Disappointed!
"
8257,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
Bought renewed in excellent condition.Easy set up.  Great pictures.Highly recommended.Excellent service from seller.
"
8258,B08PCCZMMR,2,"
So, this 'excellent, no cosmetic damage visible from 30cm' condition phone didn't work out for me.  Didn't get as far as switching it on to comment on battery life etc.  Oh well, on to the next one.
"
8259,B08PCCZMMR,3,"
The product was good except for battery health. It was just 87% and the phone would heat up easily. The charger was not type c charger.
"
8260,B08PCCZMMR,2,"
Screen quickly scratched from the devastating onslaught of being in a soft empty pocket.  Back appears to be made of glass hewn from crystallised cheese.  My old SE lived 5 years without a scratch.  Bit cack really

I was very worried about buying a secondhand/renewed iPhone, he has so many bad stories but I really couldn’t afford a brand-new one so I took a chance I was so so pleased the quality is fantastic it looks new the battery is 92% which is excellent lasts all day with use Spotify YouTube Facebook et cetera et cetera I am so happy with this product thank you Alison you still have not failed me
"
8262,B08PCCZMMR,2,"
Advertised as ""new"" but arrived with lots of marks and scratches to the screen.
"
8263,B08PCCZMMR,2,"
Very disappointed and pissed off. This was bought for a birthday present.. 18th. I felt so embarrassed when it didnt work proprely. As she needed it for college, I had to go out and buy another one in a local shop.
"
8264,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
Very pleased indeed with the condition of this, considerably cheaper than new and other than a generic box and power adapter you’d never know it wasn’t new, excellent condition, unblemished screen and a battery health of nearly 90%  I wasn’t sure whether buying a “renewed” item was a good move but it’s been spot on
"
8265,B08PCCZMMR,4,"
Phone is just like new- really amazing quality, no bumps or scratches at all. My only concern is how hot it gets when using a few apps at a time, especially when using google maps or a similar app. I have to be very conscious to close all other running apps when using. Not sure if this is a general issue or not though!
"
8266,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
Luckily covered Apple warranty for almost 8 months. Very good condition and happy with the purchase.Not got the Apple iPhone box, original charging cable. Phone is in great shape though with battery almost 100%.
"
8267,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
The Phone is in perfect working order and great condition
"
8268,B08PCCZMMR,2,"
Hidden damage means I can’t use it with an audio jack

8269,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
Buying a second hand phone is always a bit of a risk if you don’t know the supplier. I am very pleased with the phone and would use the company again.
"
8270,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
Really nice phone Excellent condition not a scratch on it like Brand-new would bye again from them. Value for money face recognition works fine battery life good thank you very much
"
8271,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
Good no scratches and looks brand new. 88% battery life. Arrived quickly too
"
8272,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
4-5 teeny tiny marks on the top edge of the phone and a very very fine scratch on the back of maybe 2mm, but so small you need to be right up close, within a few centimetres of the phone really giving it a thorough examination. Rest of phone, including screen looks as new. Battery 99%. Came with what looks like an original apple plug and lightning cable (both usb, not usb-c) and sim ejector. All in all very pleased.
"
8273,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
Five stars ⭐️
"
8274,B08PCCZMMR,1,"
I ordered an excellent condition iPhone which in the description states there will be no scratches on the screen. Upon receiving the item, the screen is covered in scratches with a few of them being long and deep. What’s the point in paying extra for excellent condition if it’s barely even ‘acceptable’ condition?
"
8275,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
IPhone arrived in 2 days , came in an unbranded box, sim tool & charger. Screen & body in excellent condition no marks or scratches with  battery health 95%.I used the phone for a week now so far I have not found an issue, I  tested playing video , photos, games and yes even phoned a friend. I not been able to test the wireless charging or Bluetooth earbuds with the phone.
"
8276,B08PCCZMMR,4,"
phone is good conditionI like the product
"
8277,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
Was bought in error not realising it was renewed, seller very good and said they would accept return, phone  on arrival was great so my daughter decided to keep it.
"
8278,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
Really pleased with my phone, looks brand new so glad I saved a bit of money by buying second hand with a years warranty included from a trusted Amazon seller. Delivery took a bit longer than expected but seems that was a Royal Mail error
"
8279,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
Better than expected battery life not bad, but I use my phone a lot and I ask a lot from it and it don’t disappoints me.
"
8280,B08PCCZMMR,2,"
I bought one in ""excellent"" condition and got billed. This isn't in excellent condition. It is 89% battery and scratches all around the body. Screen is OK. Haven't tested further. Request immediate refund. Absolutely shame for ""Amazon quality"" selling this with misguided information.I can't believe Amazon has partner with this provider. My trust in Amazon brand has dip considerably. Think twice before you buy.Updated: you will need to pay for the return costs. Avoid this product please.
"
8281,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
If you have the money you are gonna B get better value b in the long. Run  buying an iPhone

8284,B08PCCZMMR,2,"
Camera outer cover visibly scratched
"
8285,B08PCCZMMR,1,"
Also the battery life is at 88%! I was not aware of that ?! After what I was charged for the phone I am so unhappy with the product ?
"
8286,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
The phone surpassed my expectations when it arrived. The phone was clean and such good quality, it was as if it was new. No visible scratches and 100% battery health. I also like the packaging! The phone has an amazing camera and great sound quality. Glad it came with a cable too! I’m really glad I bought from this company, rather than getting a new phone from Apple. I’m really happy and I would recommend the phone to anyone.
"
8287,B08PCCZMMR,1,"
Upon arrival the phone looked as good as new and had 100% battery life.  After transferring data across the phone had no service.  I checked the IMEI and found it to be blacklisted.  Although I asked for replacement a refund was sent (still waiting 3 days on), and prices to buy another phone had increased.  Third party seller was Mazuma.
"
8288,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
Excellent condition and speedy service
"
8289,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
Almost like new. All works okay other than the iOS can’t analyse the battery health due to an unknown battery part as the message states.
"
8290,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
A very good quality refurbished iPhone 12 mint condition arrived swiftly good value for money . Would purchase from them again.

Described as ‘excellent’ condition but numerous nicks around the edges of the phone and the screen has clearly been inadequately replaced as it is bent.Do NOT buy from Loop mobile!

The phone was delivered quickly enough but I failed within 5 minutes of unboxing.Clearly the device had not been tested prior to dispatch.It’s wasted my time.
"
8309,B08PCCZMMR,1,"
Phone was badly damaged, scratches, dents visible from much more than 30cm. Old looking phone. Company takes days to respond back to you. Returned phone wanted me to wait another 5 days to see if had stock after waiting a week to get return label and for them to get the phone back.Awaiting refund off Amazon. Avoid at all costs. Purchased a mint phone off Apple which is refurbed, brand new battery and all coverings for 72 more. Full 12 warranty too with ApplePlease avoid, don’t make mistake I made. Selling rubbish, poor phones.

OMG this is a lot to spend on a reconditioned phone don’t they have any quality checking? This is the screen as it arrived. When bought it gave a 30 days money back guarantee but on the order it says we can only return by tomorrow which is the day the phone was supposed to arrive. Luckily it came a day early. On top of that the return address is completely illegible. Son is so disappointed as he spent he saved up for this.

Disappointing to see so many chips - this phone has had a bit of a history.  Compounded by the screen simply not working.  All I had was a torch - not worth £473.99 then.

8325,B08PCCZMMR,1,"
Really annoyed to buy this and find that microphone not working. Took to apple store to run diagnostics and they told me phone had been already looked at by an apple store and same problem reported. Why can’t Phones Direct UK check before issuing ? Real hassle and now have to return.

8326,B08PCCZMMR,1,"
Came with no phone

I tried 3 different chips from 2 different brands and none of them worked.
"
8329,B08PCCZMMR,1,"
I want no association with apple, this was a purchase on my account not for me.
"
8330,B08PCCZMMR,2,"
Was expecting something with better battery life. 90% suggests this phone is getting old. Apple recommend changing battery at 80% so it’s half way there.Minor scratch on screen.Not really bowled over, it’s cheaper than a new phone but only time will tell if it turns out to be an actual saving over a contract phone.
"
8331,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
Great price. Phone has 100% battery health and only 1 micro scratch on the screen. Looks basically brand new :)
"
8332,B08PCCZMMR,1,"
Warning, proceed with caution.  The phone I received had a faulty microphone and clearly had not been checked.  Took a few weeks to receive the refund, so not worth the hassle really compared to buying new.
"
8333,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
I’ve had this phone for 5 months now I still haven’t seen an issue with it. It works like a brand new phone. I’m amazed.

There's a little scratch on the screen. Also, finger prints readable somehow require a couple of attempts to recognise.

I owned a iPhone 11 and think it's time to upgrade to iPhone 12, but when I first received it was not impressed, after fully charges, a bit overheats and the camera is poor quality, my iPhone 11 better than these, so the next day I requested to return for full refund! I’m really disappointed in this product. getting a refund.
"
8342,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
Was great quality,a good price and it arrived very quickly!
"
8343,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
This product was in perfect quality no scratches at all even when i looked very close and 100% battery life. I would recommend this product to anyone as it was good value and good quality.
"
8344,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
Very good quality phone!
"
8345,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
I can't say enough about this phone, as, in the header, it is like a brand-new iPhone. The battery charges to a full 100%, which I find is a problem many people find buying from anywhere else, some only charge to 80%, but not mine. I haven't found anything yet that doesn't work as it should, I cannot praise this seller enough, it's a brilliant piece of kit.

8346,B08PCCZMMR,4,"
iPhone 12 reconditionné en parfait état. Le profit n’avais aucune rayure, on aurait dit un neuf. Mais après 3 mois d’utilisation je me suis rendu compte que je captais mal la 4 g et qu’elle était de mauvaise qualité. Aussi l’état de santé de ma batterie est passé de 100 a 90 % en 3 mois. La qualité chimique de la batterie m’as donc tout l’air d’être faible. Apart cela, très bon produit avec une super qualité.
"
8347,B08PCCZMMR,4,"
Lievi inestetismi sulla scocca posteriore a livello delle fotocamere e dei lati, qualche graffio impercettibile sul vetro frontale, ma nulla che non mi aspettassi. La batteria all’85% mi ha un po’ deluso peró bisogna ammettere che era stato specificato in descrizione che le batterie erano dall’85% in poi (pensa che sfiga proprio a me doveva capitare il requisito minimo). Ho pagato a rate Cofidis. Per il resto é tutto normale, nessun danno di sistema. Poteva essere incartato meglio e la puntina per accedere al vano sim non c’era.
"
8348,B08PCCZMMR,4,"
Sono rimasto soddisfatto dell’acquisto. Presenta segni di caduta e sfregamento solo intorno alle fotocamere, sennò sarebbe stato come nuovo esteticamente. Non sono uno che ne fa un grande uso di social o programmi che stressano la CPU, quindi la batteria al 90% non è un ostacolo per me, ma comunque sarà sufficiente per la maggior parte degli acquirenti.
"
8349,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
Handy wie neu, nur gaaanz winzige Gebrauchsspuren - mit bloßen Auge nicht zu erkennen, Batterie 99%, Panzerglas, Ladegerät, Schnelle Lieferung, 100% zu empfehlen - WOW
"
8350,B08PCCZMMR,4,"
L’iPhone est bien mais un soucis d’écran tactile et la batterie maximal 86% pourtant j’ai pris «très bonne état » mais caaVa
"
8351,B08PCCZMMR,4,"
Compre el teléfono en estado excelente. De aspecto está casi como nuevo, tan sólo tiene unas pequeñas marcas en el marco.Las pegas que veo son la salud de la batería que está al 85% y siendo de estado excelente me esperaba que estuviera algo mejor y por último, viene sin caja original y con un cargador y cable del chino…
"
8352,B08PCCZMMR,4,"
Ich hatte erst angst das ich schrott gekauft hab aber ich war echt überrascht das handy hat kein einzigen krazer und sieht toll aus leider ust dur akkukap. Bei 86%  und ust unverpackt nut in Folie angekommen alles in einem bin ich aber zufrieden
"
8353,B08PCCZMMR,4,"
Arrivato in tempi previsti.La batteria è al 99% vediamo nel tempo come si comporta , unica pecca un graffio sullo schermo che non rispecchia la descrizione di prodotto eccellente ( che prevede che non si vedono segni evidenti a meno di 30 cm di distanza ). Il resto sembra funzionare tutto a dovere . Non do 5 stelle per il graffio . In ogni caso consiglio l’acquisto
"
8354,B08PCCZMMR,4,"
Bonjour j’ai reçu le portable 2 jours après la commande ça rien à dire, le téléphone a seulement des chtons en haut et en bas sur le cadre aluminium, état de la batterie à 96%, au bout de 3 jours elle est descendu à 95%, tout fonctionne pour l’instant parfaitement bien, livré avec chargeur complet mais qui n’est pas de chez Apple, une coque transparente de qualité médiocre et un verre trempé pareil de qualité médiocre, mais ça protège pour l’instant c’est le principal. Voilà
"
8355,B08PCCZMMR,4,"
ich war sehr skeptisch, sehr ! Aber , ... ich wurde positiv überrascht ! Display top / Sauberkeit top, Funktion fehlerfrei / Batterie 85%, ich bin zufrieden bis ...  der Preis ist etwas zu hoch !
"
8356,B08PCCZMMR,4,"
complessivamente al momento sembra soddisfacente
"
8357,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
Il telefono é arrivato prima dei tempi stabiliti (e di questo vi ringrazio) ho contattato il venditore per un problema di indirizzo ed é stato pronto nel darmi una corretta soluzione. iPhone è perfetto in tutte le sue funzioni e nell’estetica. Che dire soddisfattissima
"
8358,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
All'inizio ero molto titubante vista la spesa da sostenere: comprare un rigenerato su internet oppure no?Vista la dipartita del mio precedente telefono mi sono deciso ed ho proceduto con l'acquisto.Sono molto soddisfatto.Il packaging dell'oggetto è veramente misero ma, a mio avviso, ininfluente ai fini della valutazione: ho comprato un telefono non la scatola che lo contiene.Per cui, vista la mia esperienza, vi consiglio il venditore.
"
8359,B08PCCZMMR,4,"
Das Telefon hat als generalüberholtes Gerät ein sehr gutes Äußeres:- der Bildschirm ist makellos- Das Gehäuse hat einen winzigen Kratzer in einer Ecke, sonst fehlerfrei- technisch funktioniert alles wie bei einem NeugerätEinziges Manko:- die Batteriekapazität beträgt nur noch 80 %.Ein baugleiches anderes Gerät, was zwei Jahre im Dauerbetrieb ist, hat 88 %. Daraus schließe ich dass dieses Gerät mindestens drei Jahre alt sein dürfte.Wegen dieser 80 % max. Kapazität Bewerte ich das Gerät in Summe als „gut“ und mit vier Sternen.(Da 80 % für mich die akzeptable Grenze ist, habe ich das Gerät nicht umgetauscht.)
"
8360,B08PCCZMMR,4,"
Telefono arrivato puntuale,ben imballato, dentro la confezione oltre alla presa e filo per caricare (la batteria dura tanto) anche una cover trasparente e la protezione vetro, i 2 graffietti sotto sono talmente piccoli che neanche si vedono.....buon acquisto lo consiglio
"
8361,B08PCCZMMR,4,"
Ha llegado un día tarde pero de momento muy bien
"
8362,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
Il telefono si presenta in maniera quasi perfetta per quello sono contentissimo ma la durata della batteria è veramente scarsa per l’autonomia quindi sono piuttosto deluso per il prezzo che l’ho pagato. Mi aspettavo una batteria più fresca. Credo sarò costretto a farla sostituire… spero non a mie spese
"
8363,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
Trotz einiger negativer Rezensionen  bestellt. Ich persönlich kann diese nicht nachvollziehen. Zustand wie neu und der Versand war prompt und zuverlässig. Gerne wieder.
"
8364,B08PCCZMMR,4,"
Ho preso per la prima volta un iphone per provare un sistema diverso rispetto ad un android e l'ho trovo molto intuitivo, semplice e veloce. E' arrivato con un giorno di anticipo rispetto al previsto e apparte qualche ammaccatura leggera nei bordi della scocca del telefono ( cosa prevedibile in quanto comprato ricondizionato con dicitura buono e non eccellente) perfettamente funzionante, veloce e e in buone condizioni. Qualità prezzo ottimo, il più conveniente rispetto a tutti gli altri. Assolutamente soddisfatto dell'acquisto fatto!
"
8365,B08PCCZMMR,4,"
Spedizione molto veloce (nonostante non fosse Amazon), arrivato un giorno prima del previsto.Condizioni: eccellenti e ho notato un leggero e quasi impercettibile graffietto (davvero minuscolo) sulla parte bassa dello schermo e lo stato della batteria era dell’84% (e speravo di avere una percentuale più bassa, ma purtroppo no, su amazon le condizioni “Eccellenti” assicurano dall’80% dello stato della batteria in poi).Per il resto veramente tutto perfetto, é il mio primo iPhone e penso non sarà assolutamente l’ultimo e sono onestamente felice di aver abbandonato Android.Perché passare da Android ad iOS?- stabilità nel sistema- aggiornamenti precisi e che sicuramente copriranno il dispositivo per parecchi anni (di media 4).- applicazioni ed integrazioni perfettamente ottimizzate con il dispositivo- se ormai (come me) vi siete annoiati nello smanettare con un telefono e della personalizzazione totale ve ne frega poco allora questo potrebbe essere anche un altro motivo per passare ad iOS, ma attenzione, iOS permette tranquillamente una bella parte di personalizzazione ma sempre fino ad un certo punto.

8366,B08PCCZMMR,4,"
j’ai reçu le en très bon état, la batterie est a 100% (on tient une journée, pour l’instant) le tel est comme neuf, fournit avec chargeur, je recommande 👍
"
8367,B08PCCZMMR,3,"
Durée de vie de batterie à 85% autant dire que dans un an il faudra changer… déception mais rentre dans leur condition de vente 80% minimum. Mais déçu quand même !Par contre descriptif erronée, câble usb normal, alors que c’est indiqué usb-C à charge rapide.Vendeur pas très conciliant, au moindre soucis ou insatisfaction il faut renvoyer le produit… pas de solution. Alors que c’est une erreur de description de produit !
"
8368,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
Spedizione tutto sommato nei tempi, considerando che il corriere era fedex. iPhone come nuovo salvo qualche lievissimo graffio, batteria al 100%, cavo Apple e caricatore originale inclusi.
"
8369,B08PCCZMMR,4,"
Ottimo prodotto. Il cellulare non ha neanche un graffio. L’ unica cosa che mi ha dispiaciuto un pó: un cellulare con lo stato “eccellente” dovrebbe avere uno stato di batterio superiore a 90%. (mi è arrivato con 85%) Peró, di sicuro mi prenderó un altro cellulare ricondizionato.
"
8370,B08PCCZMMR,4,"
Questo smartphone non ha bisogno di presentazioni, quindi non dirò nulla su aspetti tecnici o cose simili. Quello che è importante sottolineare, a mio avviso, è la qualità di un prodotto ricondizionato come questo che comunque richiede un esborso economico non indifferente per le tasche della maggior parte delle persone. Quindi il dubbio è sempre lo stesso: prendere un prodotto ricondizionato risparmiando qualche centinaia di euro o fare un ulteriore sforzo e prenderlo nuovo.Ho preso questo telefono per mia figlia quasi adolescente, era da tempo che voleva un iPhone, visto che quasi tutte le sue amiche ce l'hanno. Alla fine ho ceduto ma col patto di spendere al massimo una cifra intorno a 500 euro. Così è stato,  ho preso questo iPhone 12 ricondizionato a 555 euro. Il giudizio sul prodotto è assolutamente positivo. Il telefono è praticamente nuovo, non ha un minimo grasso, nessun difetto di assemblaggio, la batteria dura tranquillamente una giornata. Assolutamente nulla da dire.Il telefono arriva in una scatola non originale con cavo e caricabatteria non originale.Dopo un mesetto ho dovuto cambiare il cavetto in dotazione con un altro da 3A/20w.Consiglio l'acquisto di questo prodotto.

El teléfono vino en perfecto estado y un día antes de lo previsto. Lo configure y probé lo inicial, cámara, altavoces, llamadas y por el momento todo perfecto. Vengo desde un iPhone XR y quizás no noto mucho la diferencia, ya que uso lo básico. Aunque iré actualizando el comentario. Vendedor 10/10

El iPhone 12, llegó perfecto sin ningún rasguño. Con cargador, cable, protector de pantalla y carcasa, todo nuevo. Los accesorios de calidad corriente. Comprobé el IMEI y era auténtico.Solo que al ser de otro país, no tenía garantía. La batería al 85%. Espero no tener problemas, de momento contenta.

Acquistato ricondizionato ma l’articolo si presenta in perfette condizioni. No graffi, no ammaccature, schermo nuovo e no imperfezioni. Esattamente come nuovo.Ovviamente essendo però ricondizionato non arriva con scatola nuova ufficiale Apple, ma con una anonima del venditore. Non credo sia un problema!

Preso per mio figlio, arrivato nei tempi, articolo praticamente nuovo e batteria lo stesso, consigliatissimo
"
8381,B08PCCZMMR,3,"
Ero molto neutro a comprare un telefono ricondizionato ma il prezzo mi ha convinto, l’ho comprato e devo dire che sono contento, batteria arrivata al 89% (buono secondo me, poteva essere di meno) e il telefono in uno stato praticamente perfetto, solo una piccola graffa nello speaker però neanche si vede se non lo sai. Il telefono è anche arrivato qualche giorno prima della data di consegna prevista, cosa molto positiva.L’unica cosa che direi come parte non molto positiva è il fatto che lo schermo non sembra di essere quello originale, e per questo non metto 4 stelle. Spunta un messaggio in impostazioni che dice ciò, però, come ho detto prima, per il prezzo sono soddisfatto perché comunque funziona perfettamente. Sinceramente lo comprerei di nuovo.

Para el uso que le doy (redes sociales, cámara, juegos) no tengo ninguna queja. Ni siquiera la batería está tan mal como pensaba (me vino al 85% de salud). Lo único es que tenía algunas mejores expectativas en la calidad de la cámara, por ejemplo a contraluz o a oscuras no me ha llegado a convencer, pero fuera de eso, si se tiene una buena iluminación realmente no tengo quejas, ninguna.

Prodotto arrivato una prima volta con un problema alla batteria, servizio clienti ottimo perchè me lo hanno ritirato e riparato in tempi brevissimi. Purtroppo però ho comprato un telefono in condizioni eccellenti (come da descrizione non dovrebbero esserci graffi visibili oltre i 30 cm) ma lo schermo presenta molti graffi nei bordi abbastanza visibili. Una stella in più perchè la batteria è al 100%.

 Ho acquistato questo Iphone 12 blu (128Gb) ricondizionato in condizioni ""eccellenti"" al prezzo di 660€. Le condizioni sono molto buone, ma è comunque presente un leggero segno sul pannello posteriore (come da foto) e lo schermo è perfetto (forse addirittura nuovo). La batteria risulta essere al 89% della capacità massima.Il prodotto ovviamente è ottimo, ma per condizione ""eccellenti"" mi sarei aspettato una batteria con capacità > 90% e nessun segno sul pannello posteriore (soprattutto considerando il costo pagato).Per questo motivo non do 5 stelle... Segnalo inoltre che nella confezione era addirittura presente un vetro protettivo e una cover trasparente (sorpresa molto gradita).Se ritieni utile questa recensione, sarebbe carino un pollice all'insù.Grazie

Comprato come usato in condizioni ""Eccellenti"" ma sono evidenti graffi sugli angoli superiori ben visibili, non ben pulito e batteria con poco più 80% di massima carica. Schermo integro con proteggi schermo già applicato. Per un telefono pagato circa il 25% meno di uno nuovo sorge il dubbio se ne è valsa la pena. La spedizione gestita come da aspettativa, ma confezione semplice con imballo protettivo un pò semplice. Ho acquistato da poco Phone usato da società tedesca che lo ha spedito in una confezione e packaging simile all'originale e in condizioni da quasi nuovo con lo stesso sconto. Ci sono ampi margini di miglioramento nella gestione dell'usato imparando da altri.

8397,B08PCCZMMR,3,"
Calidad precio es aceptable. Lo único malo es que lo compre en condición excelente y muestra arañazos a mas de 30cm de distancia, no al revés como decía la publicación ya que no tenia que verse ningún arañazo a mas de 30cm. Cumplieron lo de la batería, que su vida útil (capacidad) es mayor al 80%. La pantalla si me puso un poco a dudar ya que pienso que no esta bien ensamblada porque se puede apreciar que se sale del marco muy ligeramente y si le aplico un poco de presión se observa que se hunde un poco.De resto me funciona todo bien, cumplieron casi como estaba descrito en la publicación.Lo recomiendo si no quieren gastar mucho mas y si no les importa ciertas características quitando los rasguños puede valer la pena para algunos.Mirarlo bien!

Ya me hacia falta cambiarme de teléfono, y pensé en uno que sea calidad/precio como este IPhone. Reacondicionados es una lotería, pero a mi al menos este IPhone me ha salido en muy buen estado. A parte de que llevo buscando este IPhone hace tiempo porque me gusta bastante. En general muy alegre por la compra, ya que el teléfono únicamente me ha venido con un pico en un lateral que apenas se ve el pico ya que es pequeño. Y el porcentaje de la batería está a un 98% a si que bien, si baja rápido estos días lo comentaré.

Inizio dicendo che il prodotto mi è arrivato in ottime condizioni, non nella sua scatola originale ma in una targata ""loop"" con il cavetto originale e addirittura con un caricatore non originale ma nuovo, il prodotto ripeto si presenta molto bene, nessun graffio evidente e nessun tipo di danneggiamento vario, anche lo schermo risulta immacolato e ben tenuto, la batteria nel mio caso era al 99% ma devo segnalare che dopo nemmeno 3 mesi la percentuale è scesa al 95%, personalmente cerco di preservare il più possibile la batteria, ovvero non farlo scaricare oltre il 20% e non farlo caricare oltre 80% (sarà arrivato 5 volte al massimo al 100% e 5 volte sotto il 20% ma mai sotto il 15%, il dispositivo è sempre stato caricato con il caricatore originale della Apple da 20W, quindi valutate voi se è normale questo aspetto. Altra nota dolente è la fotocamera che da qualche giorno ha iniziato ad avere degli artefatti all'interno delle fotografie o video scattati in presenza di poca luce o con un fonte luminosa piazzata frontalmente, oltre a questi problemi devo dire che il telefono funziona davvero bene, nel caso il problema della batteria e della fotocamera dovessero divenire ancora più marcati valuterò se fare il reso. In fin dei conti direi un buon 7.5, magari sono stato sfortunato io.[AGGIORNAMENTO]Segnalo che da giugno la capacità della batteria è scesa fino al 90%, questo a mio parere denota che la batteria molto probabilmente è stata sostituita con una non performante o non originale.[AGGIORNAMENTO 2]Segnalo che la luminosità dello schermo in alcune situazioni diventa davvero bassa, nonostante la luminosità automatica sia disattivata e inoltre non si può alzare e questo comporta che sotto il sole non si veda assolutamente nulla, credo che questo problema sia dato da una sorta di surriscaldamento del dispositivo.Se hai trovato utile la mia recensione sarebbe bello se lasciassi un bel 👍

*Edito porque ha habido cambios en la bateria.La batería llegó con una salud del 97% y a los 11 días está al 95%. Lo cargo únicamente por la noche ya que me llega a final del día sin problema, pero me sorprende que esté bajando la salud tan rápido.Una de las lentes ha venido con varios arañazos, me lo han pulido y ya apenas se ven.Como curiosidad añadir que el iPhone es importado y no decía nada en la descripción, pero todavía no sé si eso podría afectar en algo actualmente o en un futuro en Europa, así que no sé si puede ser algo beneficioso o perjudicial.

C'est la première fois que cela m'arrive et j'en suis très déçu. Il y a eu un réel problème de communication entre Chronopost, la Poste et l'expéditeur sur le colis. Les informations n'étaient pas les mêmes pour chacun. Ce qui a fait que je me suis retrouvé avec un remboursement alors que j'avais bien reçu mon téléphone. Ce téléphone qui d'ailleurs était en parfait Etat comme je l'avais commandé. Aucunes rayures, qualité au top, et batterie à 100 !!! Mon téléphone faisait la journée complète et remplaçait l'ancien qui beug énormément. Mais que je dois reprendre aujourd'hui car je me retrouve contraint de rendre le téléphone acheté. Et pour ces gros problèmes de communication je suis déçu. J'ai acheté ce téléphone durant le black friday et je dois le racheter aujourd'hui, avec un prix plus conséquent... Ce qui est impossible pour un étudiant comme moi.

Il telefono è arrivato sano, con tutte le parti funzionanti però si vede che non è pari al nuovo, nonostante io abbia scelto la categoria A, è arrivato graffiato ai lati della fotocamera e leggermente graffiato sulla parte finale del cellulare anche se non si nota molto.La batteria era dell'88% dunque tra un anno dovrei già cambiarla.Consiglio se non si vuole spendere molto ma tuttavia non vi aspettate chissà che.

J'achète un iPhone 12 blanc 128Go reconditionné avec la mention ""Excellent état"". On paie plus cher pour ça, et d'après les critères du vendeur : ""Corps : aucun signe de dommage cosmétique lorsqu'il est tenu à 30 centimètres de distance"". Sauf qu'on voir des tas d'impacts sur les anneaux de protection des obkectifs photo, même à 1m de distance !Également, des traces collantes (probablement laissées par une ancienne protection de mauvaise qualité) sont mal enlevées.Enfin, la batterie était usagée (capacité 79%, « à réparer » affiché sur le téléphone ) au lieu des plus de 80% garantis.Pour les traces, ça va encore, mais les anneaux abîmés, c'est clairement pas dans les critères ""Excellent état"" du vendeur 😡Je vais renvoyer cet article, et je changerai mon évaluation en fonction de ce qui se passe ensuite…

Ne ho comprati due uno bianco è uno nero (il bianco ha dei graffi) arrivati senza scatola chiusi in una busta delle lettere, cavetto troppo grosso per caricarli devo levare la cover!  comprati a marzo a distanza di 4 mesi la batteria è scesa a 96% e il nero devo ricaricarlo più volte al giorno si scarica velocemente! Batteria non affidabile per niente ho chiesto il reso meglio comprare un prodotto nuovo.

Acquistato Iphone 12 128 gb il 22 Novembre, prezzo molto competitivo per un dispositivo in condizioni ""eccellenti"" che poi si è rivelato tutto il contrario. Il dispositivo infatti presentava ammaccature molto visibili sulla scocca da oltre 30 cm di distanza (al contrario di quanto scritto sul sito) e lo schermo presentava dei graffi ben visibili anche senza tenere il dispositivo controluce. Inoltre presa lightning e altoparlante frontale sporchi con presenza di polvere, non il massimo per un dispositivo che dovrebbe essere testato e ripulito.Nemmeno configurato, effettuerò il reso. Spero sia stato solo un caso perchè il prezzo era ottimo e la spedizione sempre al top su amazon.

Titubante all’inizio , ma appena aperta la confezione sono rimasto piacevolmente colpito , telefono perfetto , solo un piccolo graffio sulla scocca superiore, display perfetto (era l’unica cosa che mi preoccupava). Spedizione 2gg , costo 619€ ottobre 2022. Consiglio!

Compre el producto aproximadamente el 5 de agosto en estado excelente, a dia de hoy, 28 de noviembre ha bajado un 7% la salud de la bateria (Ya vieniendo con algunas marcas de uso y un 94% de salud), algo bastante raro que baje tan rapido no dandole mucho uso dia a dia (llego al final del dia con aprox un 45% y lo pongo a cargar con el cargador proporcionado, supuestamente compatible, y no dejandolo por la noche), hoy me encontrado con la sorpresa de que casi se podria haber quemado el escritorio porque el cable proporcionado (supuestamente, certificado por MFi) a empezado a echar humo.Aparte de todo esto, el movil es la versión de EEUU (a2172), que no deberia ser un problema en cuanto a las bandas, aunque el 5G no ha funcionado correctamente (teniendo antena cerca de casa y comprobado con la misma SIM en un movil 5G [Mi10T] ).En cuanto al resto, vino bien empaquetado, sin la caja original (no es problema).Se pide la devolución, ya que no termino de fiarme de que el terminal este en buen estado o no el indicado despues de haber pasado un tiempo de prueba bastante extenso.

Pessima esperienza: ho acquistato due iPhone 12 in condizioni ""eccellenti"" che mi sono pervenuti con schermi non originali e di cattiva qualità, nonostante la descrizione dell'oggetto parli solo della possibilità di accessori (e non componenti) non originali - problema non da poco dato il prezzo pagato. Una volta contattato, il venditore non sembra aver dato alcuna importanza al problema.
"
8491,B08PCCZMMR,3,"
Inizio col dire che è un ricondizionato a metà e questo perché è indecente avere un telefono che è stato testato e rimesso a nuovo ma con un auricolare gracchiante. Impossible fare telefonate se non con l'auricolare e poi gli audio di WhatsApp a volte manco si sentono bisogna riavviare l'App. Oltretutto il telefono scalda in una maniera allucinante soprattutto quando si ricarica in wireless. Meno male che c'è la garanzia Amazon renewed perché farò sicuramente il reso

Il telefono mi è arrivato con un graffio sulla fotocamera posteriore ,mentre quella anteriore anche se la pulisco mi trasmette l’immagine sempre e comunque sfocata sul display ,apparte questi due problemi che mi infastidiscono il telefono è praticamente quasi  nuovo peccato che in oltre dopo un po’ di giorni che lo sto usando ho notato che una cassa audio non va e l’hot spot non si può attivare per via di Danni tecnici
"
8499,B08PCCZMMR,1,"
Telefono arrivato in anticipo, tutto perfetto fino all'accensione. Ho notato subito che la cornice nera era stranamente spessa (più del mio iPhone 12 originale) e che il lato inferiore era addirittura più spesso degli altri, decentrando così l'immagine. Allora con il dubbio che si trattasse di un ricambio ho guardato più attentamente e ho visto che la nitidezza delle scritte era decisamente peggiore. Finita la configurazione ho avuto la conferma nelle impostazioni dove è riportato che lo schermo è una parte sconosciuta, probabilmente non originale.Capisco la necessità di ricondizionare telefoni con schermi danneggiati, ma mi metti un display cinese sgranato e lo spacci anche per A+?State attenti ai dettagli.

Nel giro di pochi mesi il telefono ha iniziato ad avere degli spegnimenti improvvisi e alla riaccensione il livello della batteria era cambiato dal 90 al 20% , mai una caduta , sempre trattato con perizia , gli ultimi giorni ha smesso di ricevere la carica e restava acceso al 1% solo se collegato , ma senza andare oltre quella percentuale  . Sulle impostazioni messaggio di errore che avvisa che la batteria non è originale e forse proprio per questo è durata così poco , assurdo per un telefono pagato 640 euro e tra l’altroregalato . Chiesto reso e oltre il danno la beffa perché dovrò restare una settimana o forse più senza telefono perché avrò rimborso solo dopo che il venditore riceverà l’oggetto.
"
8508,B08PCCZMMR,1,"
eigentlich sollte ich ein Foto mit einstellen. Das Gerät habe ich jedoch dirket wieder verpackt und retourniert. Dieses Gerät als ""ausgezeichnet"" für 550 Euro zu verkaufen ist eine bodenlose Frechtheit. Das Gerät hat noch nie eine Schutzfolie gesehen, außerdem ist der Vorbesitzter wohl mit einer Ecke an einer Hauswand entlang geschlittert oder es viel aus entsprechender Höhe auf den Asphalt. Total abgeranzt. Sowas hab ich noch nie geschafft mit meinen Smartphones, welche mal gestürzt sind.Dass Amazon für sowas seinen/ihren Namen hinhält ist kaum zu glauben. Ich habe kein Neugerät erwartet aber das Teil gehört eigentlich entsorgt. Unglaublich, unterirdisch, für dumm verkauft oder inkompetente Mitarbeiter. Nie wieder generalüberholt.

Venditore raccomandato! Il telefono (acquistato in condizionino eccellenti) sembra a tutti gli effetti nuovo, ad eccezione della batteria 89%,comunque dura tutta la giornata se lo si usa normalmente.Pare funzioni tutto alla perfezione , in caso aggiornerò la recensione

il telefono è arrivato 2 settimane prima della data prevista, quindi il venditore è stato davvero efficiente; peccato che abbia dovuto restituirlo perchè l'audio all'orecchio e in vivavoce era basso, non regolabile e disturbato. ok invece quello in cuffia. Il telefono dal punto di vista estetico era in condizione perfette

Telefono arrivato con bordi ammaccati ma lievemente, schermo non compatibile con il dispositivo, surriscaldamento estremo della batteria (non usabile per più di 5min) andava a fuoco, cristalli liquidi scadenti, microfono mal funzionante. Tutto questo risolvibile, ma venditore mi ha accusato mi aver fatto danni, quando io ho inviato subito foto e prove subito all’arrivo del telefono. Scortese e maleducati. Per me non sono dei venditori terzi a cui affidarsi. Avevo chiesto aiuto a loro e mi hanno detto di aspettare 14 gg, così da farmi perdere la garanzia A-Z Amazon. Per fortuna non ho aspettato e sono stato rimborsato. Amazon affidabile. LOMBARDO SHOP VERAMENTE EVITABILE
"
8514,B08PCCZMMR,5,"
Prodotto arrivato in anticipo, non nella scatola originale di iPhone ma in una scatola del venditore, senza auricolari ne alimentatore (per non è un problema perché avevo già un iPhone e userò quelli), ma il telefono è in ottime condizioni, non ha un graffio sembra nuovo. Se vogliamo trovare un difetto la batteria è al 90% ma essendo ricondizionato ci sta. Venditore consigliato, perché ho letto  recensioni dello stesso prodotto ma di altri venditori e quasi tutti si lamentavano di segni di usura.

El móvil que recibí estaba impoluto por fuera, únicamente tenía unas marcas en el cristal mínimas. Lo único que tuve que devolverlo debido a que se reiniciaba constantemente y había momentos que se quedaba la pantalla en negro y no encendía. El servicio postventa no me dio ninguna opción a la hora de comentárselo y que me mandaran otro y hacerme otro tipo de compensación, me dijeron mándalo y te reembolsamos el dinero, lo que demuestra dejadez por su parte y poco buen trato hacia el cliente. Por esto le pongo una estrella.

Venditore scorretto!Ho preso un Iphone12 ricondizionato (in ottime condizioni estetiche) ma dopo nemmeno un mese ha smesso di funzionare senza apparenti motivi, senza subire ne cadute ne urti.Amazon mi ha autorizzato il reso per garanzia ma l'assistenza del fornitore rifiuta il rimborso o sostituzione perchè nella cover mi ci è venuto un graffio. E per un graffio mi invalidi la garanzia di questo grave malfunzionamento?  Intanto il cellulare non funziona più.Roba da vergognarsi! Venditore sconsigliato!

Les deux défauts sont visible au premier coup d'oeil donc le vendeur est soit incompétent soit malhonnête, aux choix.Pour ce qui est de la batterie je ne peux pas me prononcer.

Abbiamo ordinato un telefono nero ed è arrivato blu ma siccome era urgente (abbiamo pagato anche la spedizione) poichè mia figlia studia fuori città ed era senza telefono, lo abbiamo tenuto, comprando una cover nera;-). Dopo 20 giorni non riconosce più la SIM (che provata nel mio telefono funziona). Abbiamo chiesto la sostituzione, speriamo siano rapidi (mia figlia è a casa una settimana) e che stavolta.. funzioni. È vero che è rigenerato ma costa quasi come nuovo. Peccato, la telecamera è valida e per 3 settimane è stato un buon telefono.

El teléfono llegó en aparente buen estado. La pantalla estaba cambiada, pero al ser reacondicionado, es algo comprensible. Sin embargo, a la semana de usarlo, falló el Face ID y he tenido que devolverlo. Tal y como he leído en otros comentarios, quizá deberían revisar algo mejor los teléfonos reacondicionados antes de venderlos, pues es una auténtica lotería. El servicio de logística por parte de Amazon para la devolución y resolver dudas, inmejorable. Me acabo de comprar uno nuevo para no llevarme más sustos. XD

Compre este iphone en estado excelente y ponía que las imperfecciones no se notarian a 30cm y que serian de menos de medio centímetro, pues son de unos 2cm y si pasas la uña se queda enganchada de lo profundas que son los rallados de la pantalla y le ponen el cristal porque asi se aprecian mucho menos

Non capisco perché mi è stata cancellata la precedente recensione.Quindi la riscrivo: l'iPhone 12 verde vednuto da RG RENT è tutto graffiato con un graffio importante sulla fotocamera anteriore/face ID. A volte nn riconosce il FaceID e se metto una pellicola il FACE ID non viene proprio riconosciuto e quindi sono costretto ad usare il codice di sblocco o a rimuovere la pellicola!L'ho comprato perché c'era la dicitura: condizioni eccellenti. Non chiedevo un iPhone nuovo di zecca, ma almeno uno con pochi graffi e un pò più nuovo. Ho gia richiesto il reso. Lo comprerò da un altro venditore

Ho scritto al venditore ancora senza risposta, l’iPhone che ho ricevuto ieri pomeriggio ha il frame in alluminio con profonde ammaccature e graffi, il che è molto lontano dalla descrizione “nessun segno di imperfezione a distanza di 30cm”, sono segni visibili anche a 1m (purtroppo). In queste condizioni un iPhone nuovo scontato è un’opzione più dignitosa.

Rapporto qualità prezzo direi basso/molto basso, si paga un iPhone ricondizionato 100€ in meno rispetto al nuovo e ti arriva con la scocca rovinata su tutti gli angoli, lo schermo è ok, ma sinceramente mi aspettavo molto di meglio.Mi ritengo deluso dall’acquisto, e consiglio di non fidarsi troppo della descrizione del prodotto “difetti estetici non visibili da 1 metro” mi sembra un po’ una presa in giro, i difetti si vedono, da ben più di 1 metro

Ich hatte mich sehr auf das Handy gefreut und konnte kaum auf die Lieferung warten.Ich bin zutiefst enttäuscht gewesen als ich die grüne elektrische Linie am Display sah. 😲Ich meine das Handy kostet gerade nicht wenig und man hätte sich bisschen Mühe bei der Überprüfung des Handys und der Verpackung geben können.Bevor das Handy ankam habe ich das passende Panzerglas und die passende Hülle gekauft was mir etwa 40€ gekostet habe, und selbst die haben mich mehr Freude gemacht als das Handy.Nun habe ich das Vertrauen verloren und leider nicht zu empfehlen.🥲

I bought this to replace my I phone 5s and it’s a good replacement
"
8675,B08L6YMGJX,5,"
So, I had just brought this phone a good two months ago and I have never been so pleased with a phone before. I had come from a Samsung S10e and if any of you knew that phone, you would know it is a small and very compact phone. My battery life on the Samsung was really bad, so I had decided to get an iPhone 11. Happy to say that I don't regret buying it.I had got the initial phone for £480 ish as I brought the 128gb version, since I needed the storage. I have barely used half of the storage too, which is good. The battery is actually good, it goes down gradually as the hours pass, but sometimes I notice that if I keep certain apps like Spotify opened up for a long time, the battery tends to go down faster, but that's probably because I have Spotify on 24/7. However, on a normal day, the battery basically lasts for most of the day.I had a hard time trying to adjust to the new phone and its' new functions, but I had quickly gotten used to it as I used it more and more. Obviously this is common knowledge but I don't like that Apple had gotten rid of the earphone jack. That annoyed me. But the sound is amazing on this phone.The camera is pretty decent too, it feels like I have a professional camera in my phone. The camera has many functions to suit different people's needs when it comes to having a camera in their phone. I have taken some really nice shots with my phone, and my friends could not believe that it came from my iPhone.Not going to lie, I used to be a Samsung fanboy, so I would always put Apple down for their phones and say that Samsung was better. However, that is now the contrary. I am absolutely pleased with the phone, and I know everyone hypes up iPhones, and yeah, to an extent, it shouldn't be hyped up that much, but, in my experience, this is a rock solid phone and I recommend buying it if you can't afford the more newer phones, as it essentially has all of the functions the newer phones have. Additionally, the iPhone 11 will be updated for more years, so that's even more of a reason to buy this phone.

8676,B08L6YMGJX,5,"
Have had 5 iPhones and 2 iPads and for me the iOS  system on both devices is simplicity for those who struggle with mobile phone technology.My only issues are the battery life and price which are not the best.
"
8677,B08L6YMGJX,5,"
After struggling with a 4 year old android phone I decided to take the plunge and buy my first apple phone.There are a few out there and the latest models are quite expensive, I was torn between an iphone 13 mini and a iphone 11 which apple have just stopped making.I decided to buy the older model and save myself £200 and I’m glad I did this because it is just a fantastic phone, it’s very smooth and quick and with so much to do and learn it’s slowly taking over from my iPad.With it being an older model I was a little concerned about how long it would be supported with updates but I believe apple will support this model for at least another 4 yearsIf you have an android phone and thinking about buying a new phone buy this one before supplies run out you will not be disappointed.

I bought this to replace an iPhone 7 that I use for work, this is a brand new phone and works as you would expect an Apple device.Do yourself a favour, don't buy a refurbished or renewed iPhone when you can have a new one for such a bargain price.

After waiting for a month to deliver due to supply problems to Amazon , this phone arrived with a software fault hence the low rating . Amazon did refund fast as I didnt want to take tup an option for repair .Have since purchased from another supplyer with 2 day delivery and the replacement is fine and performs well and as expected
"
8685,B08L6YMGJX,5,"
Really high quality phone for a reasonably price. You may be able to get another phone with better specs for cheaper however they will not have ios or as many years as software support that you get with apple.

iPhone has become the best cellphones in the world, So I bought this as a gift for my mom She recently swapped her old Samsung S8 for this new iPhone and she loves it. It has so many benefits it just can't go wrong, Once you start using iPhone you're stuck with them forever it has an amazing camera and night mode and a very good screen, you can find so many accessories everywhere. Overall I'm happy with the purchase. The only downside is probably the battery is not the best, but I'm probably being too demanding as I'm comparing it with my iphone 13 pro max.
"
8688,B08L6YMGJX,5,"
Bought for my daughter.  She loves it ""more than anything else in the whole world"", so, I guess that's 5 stars from her :-)
"
8689,B08L6YMGJX,5,"
This is a legit iPhone. I had my iPhone 8 Plus for 5 years and rlly didnt want to upgrade, but reached the point where I had to. in my research I was quick to find out this this is the most worth it phone atm. its a lot cheaper than I had bought my iPhone 8 Plus for, and it is exactly the same, if not better. apple is a cult, I understand why people want to buy out of it, but other companies don't even come close to them, their phones are slow, glitchy and terrible quality, unless you pay thousands, so better to buy in than suffer from the outside.
"
8690,B08L6YMGJX,5,"
If you want to good camera and batery and fit your hands, the phone is right for you. Easy to use and hold it
"

Cheaper if you purchase the red colored I phones. I saved around £70-00 buy purchasing a red one, compared to grey or black. I also got a phone with more storage because it was red!

"
8699,B08L6YMGJX,5,"
Sure some people complaining cause they don't understand how to charge it lol low IQ people shouldn't be getting iPhone anyway. So far its been awesome and the wide camera mode is very useful. For battery life I'm getting about 10-12 hours of use and when I'm not using  the iPhone the battery % doesn't appear to change. The display has no issues very clear sure its not the best in the world but I can't see any reason for getting a phone with an oled display unless you have that extra £200 spare I'm pretty sure the display is one of the reasons for such long lasting battery life. Overall I say the iPhone 11 black I got is good just make sure the seller you buying it from says amazon warehouse or amazon otherwise you might be buying from some random untruthful third party seller. Pretty sure Apple is still selling the phone on their website as well so you might as well buy it from there. I got same day delivery :p which is one of the reasons I bought my iPhone 11 from amazon.

My son’s iPhone XR suddenly failed - and was out of its warranty period. A long discussion with Apple revealed it would cost £307 to repair; I decided that would not be worthwhile as this iPhone 11 model cost a little under £600, new and delivered, straight from Apple.The cell phone arrived the very next day after ordering and was well packed for transit. The iPhone 11 is a very good item for the price, not being the latest model means a really good cost saving - and the functionality is very good indeed. My 16 year old son is delighted with his new cell phone and I recommend it.I have just one reservation: Apple does not include the charger (wall adaptor) - only the wire that now has a USB-C connection and so will not fit older Apple adaptors. This is penny pinching on the part of Apple - it only cost £10 to purchase the right adaptor, but beware when ordering.
"
8709,B08L6YMGJX,5,"
Rather than renew a contract, we bought the iPhone 11 128gb for our daughter to replace an iPhone 8 64gb.A great phone with plenty of space for apps. No plug or earphones but luckily the 8 cable and ear pods were still usable. I did buy a new plug adapter anyway just in case she needs to use the new cable.Worked brilliantly with their virgin sim card, no issues!Hopefully this handset will have the same life as its previous model, currently 2 1/2 years old and still working well!

Buying for a family member, second one of these I bought in 3 months other one failed to load the sim after 1 month, I tried to persuade him the quality is not good. Took 3 months to get a refund from Amazon - 3 phone calls, number chats and emails later after various promises I finally got it. Phone is way over priced compared to android and then you dont even get a charger or ear buds!This line is like something a comedian would say "" As part of our efforts to reach our environmental goals, iPhone 11 no longer includes a power adapter or AirPods. Please use your existing Apple power adapter and headphones or buy these accessories separately"". What if you don't have an existing apple product? this is ridiculous and should be in bold at the top (Amazon) so people notice it. you cant even plug in a normal set of ear phones into this phone. In reality it should read ""as part of our efforts to make tonnes more money and screw you the purchaser for your last cent, into spending even more money on over-priced poor quality apple white goods, and reach our goal of accumulating more millions of riches for the select few of us at the top table, you will need to buy other things in order to use our core product"" .  Apple and Amazon shame on you both using environmental awareness for obvious profiteering!

Brought this for my daughters birthday as I am so pleased with my Iphone11 , fab camaera and features. Main reason is it has 6.1 inch large screen without being a iphoneplus . Good size screen which i have been using for a number of years now and means i dont need to get my glasses out to read messages etc. Price is good too.
"
8713,B08L6YMGJX,5,"
I was a bit sceptical since it’s not a official iPhone and I wanted another colour but since my phone broke I was desperate for a new one and this one was cheaper . Anyways the phone is actually really good and the camera as well , u have to buy ur charger doe

Good
"
8715,B08L6YMGJX,5,"
Be honest it’s well priced at the moment, I’ve looked at eBay and music magpie a refurbished one is roughly about £480 give or take.Apple products being Apple we all know what happens to them after the reach a certain age but hey hoo!Face ID really fast , good battery life so far , feels good in your hand, easy to use .No charger !

Just as good if you bought off of apple. Great value for money. Easy to use (even if your not a techno-wizkiddo 💵)

A great improvement on my iPhone SE (1st edition). Works very well and transferred data in minutes from my old phone.

This was another present for my current boyfriend. He's absolutely delighted with it. Seems to do everything he needs it to do and syncs up to the watch no bother. I'm an Android user myself and personally thing apple products are stupidly over priced for the cost that they make them at.

The screen is all scratched. I don’t have time to send it back before Christmas to get another one. It’s for my daughter for Christmas. I will have to get a new screen put on it before I give it to her. Also turned up without a box.

Bought as a replacement phone for my mum and she’s getting on with it very very well. The only downside is that it has face recognition in a time we’re wearing masks due to COVID 19 (you have to use your pin instead - unless you have an Apple Watch that will unlock it for you). However this isn’t the fault of the product as this technology works very well under normal circumstances.

The I phone 11 is very nice to look and the battery last up to 2 day if you don’t use it much I use it everyday I was on android but I really like the I phone I can put all my application on this phone

Superb quality iphone as I expected from Apple but, as others have already said, why no charger plug and ear buds !The phone was relatively easy to set up and transferring from my old Android was not a problem.The camera is amazing ! However the lack of essential extras loses Apple one star.

I’ve been using apple products for around 8 years. My apple account links this to my iPad. Set up was only a couple of minutes because I was able to click one box to set it up as my old iPhone 6. Passwords photos and preferences were automatically installed. Battery life huge.

Hello there!  I'm very happy with the new iPhone 11.  He is beautiful phone and colour also. I really recommend to anyone. But one single issue is, been so expensive, why on earth does not come with charger. That's all. Thank you very much!!!

8740,B08L6YMGJX,4,"
Great phone in which I absolutely love so far. It’s so much better than my IPhone 6. Lets just hope the battery lasts longer then 5 years.  The only thing I wish Apple would add to this product is headphones compatible with the phone.

I wanted to buy iphone and I am happy with it! It is great phone!I think iPhone 11 is good quality to price ratio. Can’t afford to buy new iphone 13 so this was great compromise option.

8745,B08L6YMGJX,2,"
As a first time apple user, i tried to create an apple ID on the phone, but it said that too many IDs have been created on this particular handset so it cannot create anymore. I was under the impression that i was purchasing a brand new phone, so this is quite a surprise. Luckily my android handset created the Apple ID for me.
"
8746,B08L6YMGJX,5,"
A very good phone, you know what to expect if youve ever had an iphone.Large bright screen, simple and efficient OS, great battery life and good storage.I got mine as an amazon warehouse deal and months later it is still working perfectly, highly recommend.

I Baugh  this iPhone 11 last year October in 5 months I’m start having problems with it for the first time, I have always used iPhone.

I love this phone so much, it is a very pretty colour, the camera and battery life are great and it’s a perfect upgrade from my iPhone 7.Face ID is quick and easy to use, I love how there’s no breakable home button and the lilac colour is so beautiful I love it! If you have an iPhone 8 or below this is the perfect upgrade.
"
8752,B08L6YMGJX,5,"

Generally, there will be free shipping if you buy more than 20 pounds. I bought a 500 pounds mobile phone and charged 5 pounds for shipping. It's ridiculous.
"
8754,B08L6YMGJX,5,"
Excellent upgrade from IPhone 8 it was worth it. I love the Face ID and bigger screen also great battery life so far. It’s not 5G but by the time I upgrade again I’ll get a 5G iPhone. I’d have liked a plug for the usb c charger.
"
8755,B08L6YMGJX,5,"
the colour is so pretty and everything is amazing but like usually apple is way too expensive hahah but so worth it
"
8756,B08L6YMGJX,5,"
Speed, battery life, many apps. Why pay nearly £200 more for the latest? The design is very good and in my view better than the 12

I am very disappointed! I have just bought the iPhone 11 and I have just opened it and I realised there are no power charger or EarPods. This is my first iPhone so it doesn’t make any sense! How is possible to sell a phone without charger and EarPods! Only iPhone!!! For sure not recommended at all! Not as a first iPhone as I will have to spend more than £50 to get the charger and EarPods!

I was not so happy from beginning with this phone. It's not responsive,slow and makes simple mistakes.I have to repeat many times to get proper response.It's backward product. If this is a evolution of iPhone I bet many long time customers like myself will turn to other brands. I'm watching Google phones with a interest. If they prove that they are safe and provide highest level of SECURITY definitely I will give a try. Dissapointed user.

.  Outbound speech from the phone is routinely heard as unintelligible static by those on the receiving/listening end.  Taking it to Apple to get it addressed.  In over 10 years of buying iphones directly from Apple for me and my family, the one time I do not and this is my experience 😞

In the middle of the replacement procedure with this phone. Only had it 4 weeks . Bought a case for it and it's been on since first use. This phone has been handled like a new born but its started to reboot itself intermittently and also cannot take videos. Was also annoyed that it didnt come with the USB- C mains plug. Had to purchase a separate plug for £20+

This is my first iPhone. I had actually bought a refurb one a few weeks previously, but decided to return it and buy a brand new one from Amazon. I was prepared to wait 1-2 months for delivery, but luckily mine came just after 2 weeks! (I ordered it on October 1st and received it October 16th, much sooner than expected, so I was very happy!) I think there was a short window a few days when the white 128GB version was available immediately. The refurb one I had bought previously was already two years old with only 85% battery life left, so it was a no brainer to get a new one instead at almost the same price! I think it's still a very good purchase at the end of 2021 with the current price drop - I really only need this phone for Instagram, which is optimised for the iOS. I love the camera with all the gimmicks: slo-mo, timelapse, filters, etc and the availability of all the editing apps. It was very frustrating that my old Windows phone (which I still carry around, by the way) didn't work with any of the creative apps I wanted. So the old adage is true ""If it's not an iPhone, it's not an iPhone"".Update: I thought I would update my review a year on as I'm about to pay off the phone in a few days' time. It's been incredible so far and I never regretted buying it, even though it was a significant expense for me. I will probably use it for years before buying another one. It's still on 100% battery health a year on, even though I use it for hours every day. There are so many apps available that didn't work on my old phone - it's like a whole new world opened up for me! I'm taking and editing  photos and videos for Instagram, playing puzzles and games, surfing the net, using Facetime on the sofa or anywhere in the house instead of having to sit in front of the computer on Zoom. And it's not only for entertainment - I'm also using it for official stuff as well, when I had to prove my identity to get a passport/Covid pass, use my Waitrose vouchers, etc. All of those things would have been impossible to do on my old phone. There's a reason why all the apps work so well on iOS - it's because there are only a handful of iPhone versions for developers to tackle, whereas there is an almost infinite number of different Android devices and not all of them are optimised for every single app. Not to mention my old Windows phone, which is totally useless for any app. If you want to be in the game, you need an iPhone. I just wish they were a bit cheaper, but I guess you get what you pay for.

Bought for wife for present from Apple official online store. At last Christmas we noticed some photo having darker spot. Recently we figured out its always there and visible on light photos only. Apple technician diagnosed dirt on camera lens inside the phone :o It should be clean and is dust proof rated IP68 and yet here we are... It seems that meanwhile in mid January the warranty period expired. Well, be prepared then to pay £90 for internal vacuuming of your phone every time when some debris happen to find way to camera lense or screen. Phone in immaculate state never missused. We found plenty of reports of the same issue in Internet (iphone 11 and other iphone models) but Apple don't want to admit design flaw and does not will to repair free of charge. If you don't wont to risk extra costs then look for other phone or sell it when it's still in warranty period. Not a quality that we expected from Apple or any other devices manufacturer and thats sad as otherwise we were very happy from their products...

Having not owned an iPhone for a couple of years, I found some very minor re-learning curves with using some apps. That’s more of an observation than a criticism. I’ve had many, many phones ranging from flagship Samsung to Motorola and Xiaomi. I feel that Apple whilst overall expensive, you do get what you pay for. They do the basics exceptionally well. I recently tested the Poco x3 which I know is a sub £250 phone, but it struggled with some of the basic things like typing accuracy, apps crashing and face unlock. This iPhone does all of that seamlessly. The look might be a bit dated with the huge cut out but the Face ID is second to none and so fast yet secure. The keyboard flawless and the camera is fantastic which includes night shooting and low light photography. Videos are also top tier and unrivalled...one of my prior concerns was battery. As I have said I haven’t Owned an iPhone for a while and in that time they have massively overhauled the battery life to be excellent. I get regular 7-8.5 hours screen on time which is really strong. As opposed to the older iPhone days of 3-4 hours.... The stereo speakers are loud and balanced and the weight of the phone is heavy but not unwieldy. Negatives are that it’s not as open as Android and customisable and you do not get a charger or EarPods in the box any longer which is poor from Apple who have clearly used this for money saving tactics or money making whichever way you look at it....I purchased a good 18w fast charger for relatively low cost and had some Bluetooth headphones anyways. The phone takes around an hour and half to fully charge. It gets to around 70% quickly within 35-40 mins and then trickles to 90 before literally sipping away the remainder I presume to preserve the longevity of battery life. Overall massively happy with this phone if you can stretch to £650 get the 128gb version and with the years of software updates and fast chipset with power efficient processing this will definitely be a phone to hold onto.

Owned iPhones since the 3s and got to 6s and had it for 3years until the battery died. I thought of going up a couple of grades but settled on the yellow iPhone 11 64g. The photo I’ve included is night mode on the iPhone, just stunning!The Face ID is a terrific bit of security. The sound from the onboard speakers are great. There’s no headphone port. I’ve got wireless headphones and they work perfectly.It’s fast and easy to use. I’d always say buy a case. I bought a rubberised case and a glass screen guard just to protect it. A lightning cable will charge it. I bought a cheap wireless QI charger which protects the port.It’s the biggest phone I’ve had but I love it !

Ok so bought my iPhone 11 direct from Apple as Amazon didn’t have any at the time.  Been really pleased with the phone: camera, battery life, use as a phone !  I would however agree with others, I have a houseful of chargers and to suddenly find that this cable doesn’t fit any of them is really annoying.  Fortunately although my first iPhone it’s not my first Apple product so I have a cable I can use.  Have also found the loss of an auxiliary connection annoying.  I usually use Bluetooth headphones but occasionally I forget to charge them up or I want to connect to a non Bluetooth speaker.  Assume this is the reason why no headphones in the package.But, all in all am really pleased with this phone.

I have had this phone for a few months now and I am more than happy with it, this is the phone everyone needs, great value for money with all the features an iPhone should have. Battery life lasts me more than a day and the switch from Touch ID to Face ID is nothing to be concerned about - Face ID is so much easier to use and more natural.

First of all this is a replacement to my iPhone XR which had many faults. I really like the new iPhone and it works much better than its predecessor. It includes features like live wallpapers and real Haptic Touch and my favourite double camera. If you want an iPhone that is amazing for a good price get the new SE or the XR (Mine was a one off I presume) but if you have more money to spend buy the IPhone 11 or up. Thanks Apple

Great iPhone in every way but one… making and receiving phone calls ! Serious sound issue with a caller to your iPhone 11 hearing intermittent conversation particularly when your speakerphone is used. The only apparent cure is to wear earphones. It’s a very big issue on Apple Communities  and other forums but so far remains unresolved. We are huge fans of Apple products but this one in particular is…‘unsound’ !!

She transported all the stuff from her Apple SE in minutes, to my amazement. The only downside was Tik Tok history which they don’t allow to be downloaded so she keeps this on her previous phone.She loves it.The purchase price saving was great too.

Upgrading from an iPhone 6s to an iPhone 11 is a big jump but totally worth it. Black 32 GB, nice light weight; bigger better screen and colourful display too; the battery. It's definitely an original Apple from Amazon. Only regrets is; I should have taken 128 GB for 50£ more. Overall very good phone absolutely no regrets at all..

This is my first iPhone bought about two years ago when the 13s were coming out. I didnt regret not getting the latest model then and I feel no particular pressure to upgrade to the current 14 pros. I am happy with my purchase. Compared to the newer models you maybe missing on the higher refresh rate display (120hz on the pro models) and the smaller notch on the 13 pros or the dynamic island on the newer 14s. Apart from that the 'apple' experience is the same. the build quality is just as good and the camera is still excellent even now almost three years later.Coming from a galaxy note: If you are from an android experience the one thing you will be giving up is the freedom to install whatever app you want and customising to your heart's content. If you have also invested in a wider tech ecosystem (speakers, lights, home camera) you should check compatibility with iOS before making the switch. Alexa is a great compromise as it works with either OS.

I'll make it clear from the beginning - it was rather a struggle than a new experience, I couldn't wait to go back to my S21 Ultra.Pros- I liked the colour I got and the overall design - looks very sober and cool, like a proper nearly luxurious piece and that's probably what makes people love it - looks luxuriously;- battery is doing very well specifically on this model 12 Pro Max as the battery is bigger inside the phone, the CPU is well optimized and the display is still 60Hz, it is doing really well and even using the phone all day with Data and Wi-fi on, with a lot of time with the screen on and adaptive brightness, at 8PM I still have 35-40% of battery and there should be fair to mention this;- iOS is working good, as an overall experience. Smooth and easy but there's the same with most flagship smartphones nowadays so that's not a super feature, but worth to be mentioned as a pro;- FaceID is doing a relatively good job as well. But there are issues with it as well sometimes if I'm a bit too close to the phone, like 15-20cm it will not recognize me and I'll have to put the phone a bit further so that it could work. Also because of the mask which I'm still using ever day because of the pandemic, I always have to put it down a bit to unlock my phone with the FaceID, this is really uncomfortable. The great thing tho is that it's working in the total darkness and that's cool. I'll take it as a pro but not totally happy with it.Here I'm mostly done with the pros that I could  really appreciate and find super useful and great.Cons:- the same - design. Even tho it's looking cool, it was incredibly hard and unpleasant to operate it. The edges are really sharp, really uncomfortable, the Pro Max is a big phone and sometimes it's hard to operate it with one hand. I use to hold it in my hand keeping it with my little finger from the bottom and after only 20-30 minutes I could feel pain in my little finger and it wasn't because of the weight of the phone, but the edge which was super sharp and I found it really questionable - nobody could think about this before launching such design? Same while holding tight the phone with one hand - after some time it hurts, really hurts and that's because of the edges.- the notch and the edges - I couldn't really feel that I'm using a 2020 smartphone - it has those bezels that are still a bit bigger than other smartphones - the same S21 Ultra or some Huawei flagship, for example. It may not be a big deal for someone, but that's noticeable when switching from S21 Ultra to 12 Pro Max. About the notch - after a few days stopped noticing it, but every time I watch YouTube or Prime Video, I see it there and it's not cool at all. It doesn't feel as cool and futuristic as other smartphones.- camera - that's not even near to what every iPhone user uses to say - the best camera. Nowhere near to what is used to be called the best camera. There are pictures that are taken very good, about pictures I I'm fine but still can't see what's better than other smartphones, just a very good quality picture, by the way was struggling to download some pics on my Windows laptop and attach them to some email or edit in Photoshop as they were in some other format and had to change settings to get usual JPEG pics instead of their format - may be good for MacOS users but definitely not for most of users. Also, the camera is taking awful videos, couldn't believe that was the least Pro Max iPhone and if with daylight it could do a more or less good job, while inside under the artificial light it is not focusing properly, is not adjusting the settings automatically and it's truly unbelievably how bad it could be, the S21 Ultra is doing a fantastic job no matter of the environment and light, the iPhone couldn't. The wide pics are ok but when it comes about telephoto zoom - rubbish x2.5 compared to X10 or X3 from Samsung S21 Ultra. Just rubbish telephoto.- the iOS 15 - 8 have updated my iPhone almost a few days after buying it so most of the time I used to use it on iOS 15. That wasn't the experience I was waiting from iOS, to be honest. Probably should stay on iOS 14.7 or whichever was the latest one...- display. Even tho it's showing a great picture and colours very good, brightness very good, when coming from 120Hz from S21 Ultra to 60Hz it feels just so bad, so so bad...There are many other points but I don't see a reason to mention as it was either the same experience as with my previous Samsungs or a bit worse but not worth to mention.I'm sorry iPhone, 3 stars because I had expectations, very big but nothing that could prove the status of ""the best smartphone"" as many people use to say.

Moving from the iPhone 10 There isn’t to many changes which is what I love as I personally find Apple have maximised the features I use most for a phone for my everyday needs, The iPhone 4’s shape is a welcoming return taking a moment to look at this phone is such an elegant design, although being the pro max model I do usually find due to its boxer structure it doesn’t feel as comfortable to hold as the curves from the previous models, with the anxiety of losing grip and smashing the phone it’s a constant worry when out and about, triple checking you’re phones actually sliding into you’re jean pocket, the sheer size of the phone is big where two hands would be preferable and for some people necessary as using Safari browsing the internet trying to get my thumb to reach the previous page can be tricky and again makes you feel like you’re about to drop it, Picture and sound is amazing as always but where I’ve found the biggest difference is the camera, without even trying I was taking pictures that looked professionally taken without even trying so I am looking forward to taking this phone out to try use all its camera specs to the full. 5G capabilities depends on your phone’s carrier but I don’t see any improvement in speed, if anything I see lag before it pops down to 4G and then works fine but isn’t really an issue for me or most I would imagine, in settings you can allow the phone to use its full potential on 5G when available but it’s hardly found you can also turn this off and just use 4G only. There wasn’t a charger plug within the box which I already knew, but for those who don’t you’ll need to buy one, it’s a usb-c type not the traditional types most have been using for a few years now it does however have the usb-c to Lightning cable ready, you can also still wirelessly charge the phone. Great phone would recommend.

It's an amazing iPhone - and if it were half the weight it is, you would need force to persuade me to release it. I think weight is a declared attribute and therefore I have not deducted stars...The camera is extraordinary: 8 years ago I had a proper Canon SX50 (which replaced my 400D of 5 years earlier) - bottom of the upper-mid-range cameras. This is better! - and enormously easy to use (""point and shoot"" used to mean awful, ""but"" NOT now).For the record, nobody else paid for the camera (I bought it on my standard Amazon account) and nobody has even talked to me about paying for a review) - it was entirely my decision, without any encouragement, to get this iPhone!Having said that, I have reluctantly returned it... ONLY because its weight is (just) too much for a shirt pocket. I think I will be sorry, but I am going to try the 12 Pro - as a lighter version. If I used a wallet, trouser pocket, or handbag, I would definitely have kept it.

8911,B08L5Q84BW,5,"
After using it couple month I fully happy with its performance and shape.First I wasn’t much appreciated that Apple brought back iPhone 5 square edge design back. However it brilliant to hold, I have 12 pro max 256gb model and it has nice wide and big display . So holding big mobile could be challenging however it’s square ashes makes it easy to hold.Significantly fast than my iPhone 11 model. Couple points below witch really stands out:- battery power outstanding, I’m heavy user and it last my all day and much left over, my previous model I should charge 2-3 times.- picture quality, fantastic picture quality with improved portrait mode and 3 easy choose lenses .- screen display amazing , wide, big, colourful and responsive. Ideal for gaming and browsing on web, once get to use I didn’t want use smaller displays.Overall it’s expensive but worth every penny, ideal for professional and heavy users.

Best iPhone ever.I have always had an iPhone since 2008, usually the standard version. The previous one to this was the iPhone XS. This is the first bigger one.I am so pleased with the reversion to the previous shape with the aluminium frame.The phone looks amazing and the screen is simply beautiful. The sound production is fab, as are the photographs that it takes. This is where it sweeps the board for me: the pics are amazing. In low light this is just superb.The screen rotation is brilliant on these bigger iPhones, and makes things like the calendar really great to use. More a mini iPad functionality.Everything is very crisp and you just want to dive in.Oh, the 5G is great. Thank you to unlimited data on 5G. Brilliant.I hope that you have found this review helpful.
"
8913,B08L5Q84BW,5,"
My new play thing arrived quickly and overly packaged as  is the norm for Amazon.The phone is a nice upgrade over my XS Max. It’s quite pricey but is par for the course with Apple. In return you get the build quality and polished software that you expect from an iPhone.If you like iPhones you’ll love this model. If you’re an android fan, you’ll hate it.As for negatives… the price increase between the 128g and the 512g is excessive. It would have been nice to have the option of using an sd card to boost the storage as an option.
"
8914,B08L5Q84BW,5,"
Ok... this is by far the best phone on the market... fast, reliable... i bought it for the camera and no suprises here. You cannot compare it to iphone 12, even pro is not taking pictures as impressive as this. Even if you are bad with camera, you can impress with this...Battery life is shockingly good although i take quite alot of pictures and watch videos. Before i bought, thought might be too big, but screen size is ideal to watch videos, spend time with your phone. Sound quality is top...Value for money ? Well, it is quite expensive, but it is a high end product. When you pay this money, you are looking for a superb phone and here it is. You get what you pay for...

So far I really love this phone. I recently switched from Android to iOS for the first time and I must say that I’m quite a big fan of it now, I would have never thought it was possible. I had to google how to do a lot of things but I guess that is normal! I am impressed with the build quality and the clear sound of the speakers. I also love how big this phone is. I had a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 before and the screen of the iPhone is actually bigger! Really love it!
"
8917,B08L5Q84BW,5,"
Ok, yes this is a brilliant phone especially video & photo quality. It’s a great phone, however if I were to add any negs at all I would say the battery isn’t any longer or durable on this make as it is on other iPhones &  I’ve had a few. Price wize I’d say its not worth wot I paid. I’d have to say absolutely not. You’re paying for the name at the end of the day. If someone was to say to me, pay wot you think it’s worth, I’d go with Pheraps  £800.

8918,B08L5Q84BW,5,"
A massive upgrade on my iPhone 8 Plus. Photo quality is so much better and massive storage capacity means I can download all the videos, podcasts and apps I want. Also, battery life is much better so never have to recharge during the day. I like the face recognition software which means you don’t have to remember a password every time you make an online purchase. Can’t think of anything negative to say about the product. The only thing is I now have a iPad and digital camera which are more or less superfluous.

Very happy up to now runs faster than my iPhone 11 camera much better the only down side is the charger lead won’t fit in a usb & you don’t get the plug it’s extra? But the old iPhone 11 cable does fit & works but it’s a bit loose so  another money maker from apple
"
8921,B08L5Q84BW,5,"
I didn't really need an upgrade as my 10s was working fine but I am such a sucker for the iPhone. Camera is amazing and the size is great (there is a lot of negative reviews about this but I like it). If you dont need one dont buy it. It is the same price as a MacBook. However if you need a new one or want to move to Apple (rather than the awful android) then def buy.
"
8922,B08L5Q84BW,4,"
This is a very good phone. Sophisticated and the camera is really good. Sadly I had to return mine as it became extremely hot during charge and Face ID stopped working and could not reset. I had phone for 3-4 weeks. I will be replacing as I can’t imagine using any other phone now.I wish apple added an earbud and adapter though.

Got several different iPhones for myself and my business partners at the end of last year to celebrate what we have achieved throughout the year, which is manage to survive. However the pro max arrived in January, maybe people nowadays like huge phones and it’s out of stock for a long time. But gosh it’s really a big boi. Haven’t test any pro-only features yet but my business partner loves it and that’s good enough. Just get yours ASAP when there’s still stock.

I waited and waited to get this phone. I love it. I love the color and size. It came well boxed. Apple products are kinda on the expensive side of things.

The iPhone 12 Max is an upgrade to my iPhone X and the most noticeable thing about the new device is not the size but the weight.  The new Max display is superb and the operating system is much smoother and more fluid than my old device.  I have no issues with the size of the new device and find it easy to handle even in the genuine Apple silicone case.Sold and supplied by Amazon with free guaranteed next day special delivery.
"
8927,B08L5Q84BW,5,"
Do what it should do, good battery, bit over priced as usuall the apple stuff, but at least I had a chanche to pay it 5 slices (for 5 months).There is no charger in the box just a single cable, so it’s better to buy it with usb c connection which is charging up approx 30 mins for 80-90%
"
8928,B08L5Q84BW,5,"
THE best apple phone by a long way. If your not glued to your screen as most of the population are today expect 3 full days before recharge needed.It will also run YouTube for a solid 21 hours with 12% battery life left.Apple prices are its only drawback and surely would double sales if under the £1,000 pound limit.First class piece of Tech +++
"
8929,B08L5Q84BW,5,"
Being non tech I worried a bit about setting this up. I needn’t have it was super easy to transfer everything from my old iPhone. As I’ve got older I also found my old phone difficult to read and to type on. This max is far better with a superior display as well as being larger.

Box came empty so far no face recognition, no battery life and Can you call empty box priced 817.88£ good value for money?It looks like somebody who is working in Amazon Warehouse just appropriate mine IPhone 12 Pro Max to prove it I have an evidence which is empty package with label on it that stands the total weight of package that has been sent to me is 200 grams but the weight of the IPhone 12 Pro Max itself is 230 grams so anybody can easily do the math, the total weight of package has got to be way more, as my review keeps been removed by Amazon I’d go farther as such service is unacceptableFor 817.88£ I received from Amazon empty box of IPhone 12 Pro Max plus a lot of stress, no way to get the phone on which my weekend was depend on.AMAZON ! package that weights 230 grams no way can have the Iphone12 pro Max with mass of 228 grams inside!I hope it’s not a high Math for you .THE SO CALLED SERVICE OF AMAZON. APPEARS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT AND DISSATISFACTION TO ME THIS WEEKEND...It looks like Amazon do not care about their costumers as they conduct so called service with item of high value (price) in such manner.Who is gonna give me back my weekend, my time?AMAZON YOU RUINED MY WEEKEND!

I bought this phone with 6 months installment by Amazon, such a great service to allow lower income people like me to get hold of such brilliant iphone. a month left from my installments and it helps me in alot of way. Thank You!

The box is very small and the screen is a little bigger than the iPhone xs Max.Amazon can quickly order and get the real thing, my friend in the official network to order a month to get, it is really very convenient.It's really like an enlarged version of the iPhone 4s, which is very classic.

Love it. It’s my 5th Apple phone and wouldn’t buy any other. Every part of it is of the usual high standard. Only down side is it doesn’t work with my ERS wireless charger so I’ve had to purchase a new one.

Having used an older 6plus for the last few years, the look is different and feels a lot heavier to carry with almost same size screen, still searching for the vow factor on this model. It doesn’t justify the price tag for what I received.
"
8963,B08L5Q84BW,5,"
I stayed away from Apple for as long as I could! Now I’m glad I made the move. Stunning build quality, mind blowing camera. Oh, and you can speak to people on it!
"
8964,B08L5Q84BW,5,"
The battery life on this product is simply amazing. Not much to add in terms of quality as it’s an apple product and they are always well made and designed. If you are thinking of upgrading from a previous iPhone don’t hesitate, you won’t be disappointed.

It's ok, no better or worse than my previous iphone XR. The wifi has issues where I need to turn on & off to get it going. 5g is very fast around 190mbps indoors, but I have no need for that speed. It is well built and has a weight to it compared to a 12. It is very expensive for a phone which essentially just enables me to waste money buying things, take pics & make calls. Having lived with this phone for almost a year I can say I hate it! I had it replaced due to the back smashing & the new one has all the same issues. It is slow, functions worse than the xr and I can safely say this will be my last phone as I refuse to go to android.

After spending £1200 on a new phone, I was totally disappointed and felt conned when I opened the box to find no earphones, no C type adapter or plug to enable charging. I had to go out and purchase a C/USB cable £12. Not impressed. Unhappy. For a (3x C 1cm square adapters @£6 for 3) or a (£12 C port plug). £1200 to sacrifice an adaptor would complete the contents.

At fist this came I thought it was fave still haven’t suspicious as App Store is android store so this needs fixing or is like a new phone this is the worst phone I’ve ever brought in my life in not happy ans I’d this doesn’t get sorted I’ll be seen it to the bigger office

There is nothing to much extraordinary in the phone moreover not even the essentials like proper charger or headphones so no justification for this much price

Loses wifi continuously poor transmission fades in and out would not recommend this phone as quality of service poor and very expensive too many bad reviews on Apple community

Always had iPhones since 2010 usually update every year, The iPhone12 promax is easily the best one so far, The screen is absolutely amazing a lot of people are viewing the phone I’m not really talking about also how good the sounders it’s so loud specially go on YouTube searching for things like Dolby vision test, You get this kind of like weird 3-D sound it’s great the cameras are brilliant the max a technology is great I bought an official Apple product Red silicone MagSafe case for the phone as soon as you click it on you get a nice little pop up it even detects what colour case you have! I bought the 20w apple Charger adapter plug seeing as from now on Apple will not be Bundling a pair of headphones or plug And they’re now stating it’s because they’re trying to cut carbon footprint what strange is though I had to buy a plug adapter separate which is even more packaging and then if I wanted new headphones that will be even MORE packaging so basically they’re just lying about it and wanting even more of your money! The phone charge is ridiculous fast with the 20w and with the £19 to be fair, overall the cameras are the best on any iPhone the sound quality is superb, oled screen is superb with 6.7 inch screen, games perform fast and fluid, 5g future proof, a great battery, And if like me you were getting kind of sick and tired of the old Apple phone of the last few years and much like myself prefer the old iPhone 4 design then this will make you smile when you first lift it out of the box!! It’s feels amazing in your hands!! Best Apple phone ever, best smart phone ever...

 I have always owned an iPhone since 2008 and I have to say that this phone was a serious disappointment! I preordered the iPhone 12 Max Pro as soon as it was made available for preorder.-First, Apple no longer offers the the USB connector or earphones that usually come with the phone when you newly purchase it. With that said, if your current charger or earphones aren’t working properly you better budget to buy new ones separately. Apple claims this decision was made to “save the environment by reducing the size of the box” however, the price of the phone was not reduced to make up for that.Moreover, how are they saving the environment when they are clearly selling the USB connector and earphones separately in different boxes!!!-Secondly, there is a glitch with the camera (front and back). Whenever there is a bright light shining in the background, a green dot that appears to be the reflection of the light can be seen on the screen! The green dot can even be seen during FaceTime calls!-Third, whenever you record videos in HD or 4K mode, the phone battery overheats quickly making it difficult to hold the phone bear hands.-Lastly, vertical lines appear through the screen whenever you take videos regardless of which mode you are in HD or 4K.I would highly recommend holding off on buying this phone until Apple fixes those glitches. This phone and the quality is not meet my expectations.

The best iPhone yet, I’ve been running this phone for about 2 months now and it’s great, w a 30w charger it charges to 50% in ab 30 minutes, I put on charge overnight and it lasts the whole day so battery life is great, the camera r great but the selfie camera isn’t the best in low light, but the main cameras are great, the phone is quite slippery in hand wout a case it j feels like it wld slip out of ur hands so a case is definetly needed, the screen is very clear fast and responsive Face ID works perfectly, if u have smaller hands it might be a good choice to get the 12 pro instead of the pro max but j have huge hands and it’s perfect, 10/10 from me

9071,B08L5Q84BW,5,"
I have been an iPhone user since the beginning. Don't get me wrong, I have tried Android phones in the past but I always go back to the iPhone. I purchased the 11 Pro Max in February 2020 but when I saw that Apple had finally released a large screen iPhone it was a no-brainer to upgrade to get the 12 Pro Max which I now have in my hands and it is AMAZING! Yes, the camera isn't as high spec as some other phones but the technology behind the cameras on the iPhone gives you the same if not better quality images. At the end of the day, top brand Android phones now cost the same as iPhones so no one can moan about the cost anymore. The situation with no charger in the box doesn't bother me either. I have several chargers in the house that work perfectly plus a wireless charger in my study so not having a charger should not bother anyone and if it helps the environment by not adding one to the box then thats a positive thing for me. The overall build quality of the iPhone is beyond perfection. At the end of the day, you pay for what you get and with Apple, you get quality!

How do you milk sheep?Bring out a new I phone and charge £1000 for it.

9073,B08L5Q84BW,5,"
One word that sums this phone up....... Exceptional!! 1. The screen quality is incredibly good.2. The camera setup is like nothing before, I’ve used Samsung’s in the past but this camera is the best out there.3. Battery life is very good, being a heavy user I can get two days of use.4. The feel of this phone in your hand is pure quality, bigger is definitely the way to go.It’s not the cheapest phone around but when you consider how much you use your phone it’s well worth the investment.. Apples best phone yet!!!!
"
9074,B08L5Q84BW,5,"
Now, this really is innovation, It was well worth an upgrade on my XS Max. Despite rumours of worse off battery life, I'm really happy with it alongside the new 5G which is so fast, it's faster than my wifi at home. The new camera is incredible, the clarity in each photo makes me feel like a professional photographer, the squared-off edges on the phone makes it easier to grip and the display is equally as stunning as the back of the phone, the new Pacific Blue colour is stunning.If you're looking at upgrading your phone, seriously consider this one. It is the best on the market by a long while, the only downside is the fact it does not ship with a charging plug, but you can use any USB-C adapter, or you can use your old iPhone charger but it just will charge slightly slower.
"
9075,B08L5Q84BW,5,"
This is a beast of a phone. It’s big, it’s solid and it’s fantastic. I was initially a little concerned about the size and new shape/design. I needn’t have been.The raw power on this phone is something else.  It’s fast smooth has a great updated camera and new improved screen.  Should you update from iPhone 11 Pro Max? No I don’t think so. But anything less, definitely, you won’t regret it.It’s a pity it still has the notch and no 120hz refresh rate. However neither spoils the enjoyment of this phone.Apple has done it agin, this is apples newest and greatest iPhone ever. The new design is superb.  You won’t regret buying this phone.

I debated long and hard whether to return to iPhone after over a decade away on Android. IOS has come on a long way, as have the iPhones themselves.  And so in March 2021, possibly not too far ahead of Apple’s iPhone 13, I decided to make the jump back.  I like the larger format phone, coming from 6.7in Android the screen size is going to be a complete shoe in for me.  And I must say that I am very pleased with the iPhone 12 Pro Max so far. It does perform very fast, the cameras are top of game, just about everything about the smartphone is spot on for me. I cannot truly fault it.

It’s painful for me to do a 2 star review for a IPhone especially for which I paid £1200.Here is why honestly I been an Apple fan for years and with all goods and bad still choose apple products. It’s not about being addicted to them but more to do with the stability of apps and absolutely never crash experience.However this time round the saturation level on disappointment just crossed or the bucket 🪣  of disappointment is full. I mean seriously felt annoyed.Let’s start from design, the good part is that it has more grip due to change is sides as compared to iPhone 11 but on the same note it looks very old style like iPhone 4.Moving forward battery life slightly better nothing amazing and that slightly is probably just because it’s new.Let’s get into nitty gritty of it and what it comes with. Well it come with Nothing !!! Yep can’t understand why no charger 🔌 no ear phones? But still charging same price.So in essence you have cut your cost of production on our expensive. Felt a bit cheeky.Now let’s talk about what new well there isn’t anything that’s super new on top of iPhone 11. It just feels same body with new shinny shirt.Anyways still gone keep it for the year but probably now it’s the last one.Still with all the negative don’t get me wrong still it’s probably the best and most premium but paying so much you expect something different and unique.May be too much to ask as there is everything already in previous  iPhones📱 but even then if you are paying so much premium you expect more.Hope that helps ... Thanks .

This is without doubt the best iPhone I have ever owned.Easy to set up, quick & responsive when using & the camera is such a bonus. I also get 250gb of storage built in.Only downside is the usual high pricing of apple products, but I suppose that’s the price of quality.

This is a decent upgrade from my previous iPhone 6. Easy to set up. The most noticeable improvement is the battery life - I only have to charge it every 2 days. The camera is excellent. I've managed to drop it once and the screen didn't crack. The facial recognition doesn't work well with a face covering - not that I expected it too - so the option of fingerprint recognition might have been useful during the Pandemic. Overall I'm very happy with it. (I've had it 4 months now.)

Having read a number of reviews from various so called exports on leading computing web sites claiming that the iPhone 12 Pro Max was the ultimate phone - the best of the best - and seen first hand my girlfriends own iPhone 12 Pro, I decided that this would be my upgrade.My iPhone X 64 Gb was full up! The move to Apple Music was the main culprit, hogging more space than I’d anticipated. Ok, 512 Gb is a bit OTT right now, but we just don’t know what’s coming in the next few years do we!!Anyway, I’m pleased to report that yes, the probably is the best phone in the market right now - it’s awesome. Battery life is brilliant. Screen image amazing. Take the five payment option from Amazon - it makes the cost a little bit more manageable!If you’re a little hesitant - go on, take the plunge. You won’t regret it!

This iPhone is a huge step up from any other I’ve ever seen or used and I’ve had iPhones since the iPhone 3g. The camera is stunning and I’m a semi-professional photographer. I’m not going into a deep review of it all but suffice to say it really does live up to the hype for once, and that’s rare!The screen is stunningly clear and simply gorgeous to look at. The whole phone really makes the very most of the latest iOS 16.1 operating system but by the time you read this it will have been developed even further for sure. Using this phone is just a dream and if you’re in a 5G area, you will be blown away by its speed.This is technology at its very best and if you want the best mobile phone available today, I heartily recommend you go for this. It even has a battery that will get you through an entire long day! Not that it matters too much as I can charge mine from empty to 80% in under an hour.This isn’t the place for the kind of review this phone deserves but I can say with confidence you will not regret buying it.As a side issue, my friend and I ordered our phones on the exact same day, he from Apple and me from Amazon. I got my phone at least two weeks before he did!

 Upgraded from 12 pro max, & it was a genuine improvement. The notch has gone & has been replaced by a much smaller version, but with a mini screen/readout. Cameras are vastly improved along with screen & refresh rate.  Not impressed with the new esim!! Couldn’t put old sim in this latest apple effort & get it up & running straight away. Now having to figure out how to transfer my old number?!

When I first got the iPhone 14 pro max it was fantastic but just after one week sometimes the screen doesn’t respond and is very frustrating closing down the app and reopen it just to get it working .all in all this phone is not worth the money and the only difference in the pictures it takes is only noticeable when you crop the picture so unless your a photographer but then you would have a decent camera it don’t make any sense to get this phone and the always on bit I switched off lol

I’m gonna be realI’ve come from some generations behind but notice nothing yeah the dynamic island is cool and speaks that this is the new phone but you’ll never use it past answering calls and media playback….the phone is neverchanging and thus you end up with a reshaped version of the same thing we been getting since the iPhone 11Say what you will but the phone is mid, the delivery waiting time is beyond words (not at all worth waiting months for rather get another phone)And thus in conclusion ….. think carefully before spending on this it all depends on your financial standing and value of this productBless up fellow mindless consumers !

So after a good few years of Samsung phones, we return to Apple, and what a huge disappointment. Forget that the Samsung Galaxy S22 is an Android phone and not iOS (duh!), it's so much smaller, so comparing the two is exactly fair, but the idea was that Apple's flagship would exceed Samsung, it simply doesn't. The camera was worse for us too, but maybe for others, it isn't. As for iOS, yes is speedy, very swish, and the battery life is really good. But those were the only two positives for us. The display on the Samsung still stuns, the display on this iPhone is nothing bad, but nothing special either, for this much money, better was not just expected, it was a necessity. This review will probably get a 1000 downvotes, but we felt conned buying this by reviewers raving about it, are they all paid to do so? Sold it three weeks later and went back to the S22 Ultra. Lost £100 in the process, so not happy about that. If you're thinking of buying one, try the S22 Ultra, unless you're locked into iOS, it will impress.

This iPhone is the same built from the iPhone 12 Pro Max. The only difference between them is iPhone 14 pro max has Dynamic Island not the notch.  And Always-On display AndProMotion technology with adaptive refresh rates up to 120Hz. Apart from that you are buying  the phone twice. Just minor upgrades. Apple need to innovate.
"
9135,B0BDHZ7BQD,1,"
This review is not about the phone quality, it is about Apples customer service. I ordered the iPhone 14 Pro Max on 19th September and the money was taken a few days later on 23rd.Delivery was shown as by 23rd October. It is now 27th October and the delivery info has changed to ‘we will email you when it is in stock’.It’s bad enough having these extended waiting times, but what other business takes the full payment with no realistic delivery time for the item?You can’t even contact them!
"
9136,B0BDHZ7BQD,1,"
Basically the same as the previous phone. no need to upgrade.

9137,B0BDHZ7BQD,5,"
Amazing screen, volume clarity improved, CAMERA SYSTEM is the best. Every shot you click, it's gonna be the best shot you've ever clicked on any mobile phones.Dynamic Island is simply superb, while listening to music, receiving air drops, ring/silent. On every action you do , the island responds and it's styles are good.On a last note, it's the beast.

It has a nice feel to it the screen brightness is very good and fast to open the app and closing the app.I did not like waiting 10 weeks to receive my iPhone it should have been shipped to me by the 28/09 not the 1/12.I have used iPhone 13pro max the performance wise their is not much of a different between 14pro max to 13pro max some one who going use it day to day doze not care for the brightness of screen or the dynamic island if you can get a good deal on a 13pro max go for it.

Nachdem ich ein iPhone 12 Pro Max von Herbst 2020 in Verwendung habe, bei dem mir die Speicherkapazität langsam nicht mehr ausreicht und ich die Video-Verbesserungen seit dem iPhone 13 Pro interessant finde, ist jetzt die Zeit für ein neues iPhone.Das iPhone 14 Pro Max ist wieder sehr hochwertig verarbeitet und weiter im bewerten Design seit dem iPhone 12, dass schon an Generationen 4 bis iPhone 5S erinnert.Für mich wichtigste Neuerungen: -Haupt-Kamera deutlich verbessert mit bis zu 48 Megapixel! Allerdings im Alltag nur weiterhin 12 Megapixel und somit wohl kaum Größenunterschied der Dateien. Gut, denn wer mehr Pixel voll ausnutzen will, kann auf RAW umstellen (viel Bearbeitungs-Potential, aber riesige Dateien), bei normalen Fotos hingegen wird einfach die Qualität verbessert.  Die Brennweite entspricht jetzt einem 24mm, also etwas mehr Weitwinkel (13 Pro: 26mm).-Ultraweitwinkel-Kamera verbessert, soll auch bei Macro-Aufnahmen besser sein-2fach Zoom wieder da: Wie beim iPhone XS kann man nun wieder auch 2fach Zoom optisch nutzen - ein Bildausschnitt der Hauptkamera statt eine eigene Linse. Nachteil: Vermutlich weniger Qualität bei schwierigerem Licht, als bei 3x-Kamera-Super Retina XDR Display: Das Display soll sich noch weiter verbessert haben. Es scheint mit enorm brillant und scharf. In hellen Umgebungen soll es sogar bis zu 2000 Nits Helligkeit bieten, also auch bei starker Sonneneinstrahlung noch hell genug sein (bis zu doppelt so hell wie vorherige iPhones). Allerdings kann sich das Display bei warmer Umgebung und gleichzeitigem Laden per Powerbank etc. eventuell dimmen und nicht mehr die volle Helligkeit bieten, das fand ich beim 12 Pro Max problematisch und kann es bisher beim 14 Pro Max noch nicht beurteilen.-Neuer Prozessor bzw. Chip mit vermutlich etwas mehr Leistung, im Vergleich zum normalen iPhone 14, das weiterhin mit dem Prozessor vom Vorjahr kommt (nur 1 Grafikkern mehr ist im normalen iPhone 14 nutzbar nutzbar, wie beim 13 Pro).-Always-On Display: Wie der Name sagt, kann das Display permanent an bleiben und bei niedriger Bild-Wiederholrate energiesparend Infos anzeigen. Kann z.B. am Schreibtisch auf einem Ladeständer ganz praktisch sein… Wenn man das iPhone umdreht oder in die Tasche steckt, sollte sich das Display aber nach wie vor ganz abschalten.-Dynamic Island: Statt der bisherigen Frontkamera- und Gesichtserkennungs-Einbuchtung am oberen Displayrand, gibt es jetzt eben einen kleineren, abgetrennten Bereich, der zusätzlich rundherum den Display-Bereich einbindet, um Infos wie Musikwiedergabe etc. anzuzeigen. Eine nette Spielerei, die aktuell nur der 14 Pro-Serie vorbehalten ist.-Kinomodus (für Videoaufnahme) weiter verbessert und in 4KVorteile im Vergleich zu älteren Geräten (für alle, die überlegen, umzusteigen):-LiDAR Scanner (seit 12 Pro): Zukunftssicherer -ein großer Vorteil für Fotografie und Filmen bei wenig Licht, verbessert den Auto-Fokus der Kamera. Außerdem wird es vermutlich zunehmend mehr AR-Anwendungen etc. geben, welche von dem neuen Scanner gebrauch machen können.-Ultra-Weitwinkel-Kamera zusätzlich im Vergleich zu iPhone XS oder älter-Tele-Objektiv mit 3 fachem „Zoom“ zum im Vergleich zum iPhone 12 Pro (Max) (2,5fach Zoom) oder nur 2 fache „Zoom“ bei iPhone XS oder älter-Fotoqualität bei wenig Licht noch mal deutlich verbessert, im Vergleich zu älteren iPhones (Generation XS und abwärts) finde ich den Unterschied gigantisch, besonders auch bei Videoaufnahmen in Dämmerung… seit dem iPhone 12 noch einiges verbessert.-Kamera im 14 Pro Max sensorstabilisiert -also noch besserer Schutz vor Verwackeln bzw. Vorteile für Videoaufnahmen. Ein großer Vorteil zu älteren Generationen vor iPhone 12-Action Modus: Für Videoaufnahmen in Bewegung eine deutliche Verbesserung, seit iPhone 13 Pro (Max), kann manchmal einen Gimbal einsparen… allerdings nicht bei voller Auflösung.-In bis zu 1 TB Kapazität erhältlich, seit dem iPhone 13 Pro (Max)-Apple ProRAW-Foto-Unterstützung (seit iPhone 12 Pro). Man kann in der Nachbearbeitung mehr mit den Fotos machen (Farben anpassen etc.), allerdings deutlich größere Speichergröße. Natürlich jederzeit umschaltbar.-ProRes und Dolby Vision HDR Video: Lässt sich aktivieren um extrem hochwertige, gut bearbeitbare Videos aufzunehmen, z.B. ideal für Nutzer, die danach in Final Cut Pro schneiden möchten etc… Natürlich entsprechend hoher Speicherbedarf.  Verfügbar seit iPhone 13 Pro bzw. 12 Pro bei Dolby Vision HDR.-6 GB Arbeitsspeicher (RAM) -kein Fortschritt im Vergleich zu den Vorgängern seit iPhone 12, aber im Vergleich zu älteren iPhones (vor 12) oder Nicht-Pro Modellen.-lange Zeit Updates: Im Vergleich zu den meisten Android-Geräten wesentlich längere Unterstützung von neuen Betriebssystem-Versionen mit vielen neuen Funktionen und sogar darüber Hinaus noch Sicherheitsupdates.-iOS entwickelt sich zunehmend weiter und bringt jedes Jahr wesentliche Neuerungen auch für alte Geräte.-Guter Wasser-Schutz (nach IP 68) -seit dem iPhone 12 eine deutliche Verbesserung zu Vorgängern-5G-Unterstützung: Wer noch iPhones vor der 12. Generation nutzt, der bekommt hier auch eine interessante Verbesserung-Akku-Laufzeit im Max macht auf mich einen guten Eindruck. Ein ganzes Stück besser, als in der normalen Pro-Version… bisher konnte ich kaum Unterschiede zu älteren Max-Modellen feststellen.-MagSafe: magnetisches System zum Anschluss von Qi-Ladegeräten und anderem Zubehör an der Rückseite, seit dem iPhone 12 verbaut. Seit 2 Jahren erscheint immer mehr nützliches MagSafe-Zubehör, wie Auto-Halter, Ständer, Wallets und vieles mehr…-ein wenig größeres Display als etwas ältere Vorgänger-Modelle (11 Pro Max,  XS Max) - aber auch etwas größeres GehäuseNachteile:-Noch kein neuester WLAN-Standard wie 6E, immer noch die selbe maximale Geschwindigkeit und der selbe Standard wie schon seit Jahren, dadurch nicht so zukunftssicher-Leider immer neue Gehäusegrößen - so passen alte Hüllen nicht mehr… (MagSafe-Zubehör wie Wallet oder Ständer sind allerdings mit allen iPhones ab 12 kompatibel)-Kein Kopfhörer-Anschluss, wie schon seit dem iPhone 7. Kabel-Kopfhörer/Headsets lassen sich aber einfach per Lightning auf Klinke-Adapter anstecken, oder Zubehör direkt mit Lightning-Stecker (z.B. Apple EarPods).-Face ID im Vergleich zu Geräten mit Home-Button: Manchmal wäre das Entsperren mit dem Fingerabdruck-Sensor praktischer, wenn das iPhone z.B. flach am Tisch liegt. Das hat Apple am iPad Air im seitlichen Knopf integriert. Fände ich zusätzlich zu Face ID sehr wünschenswert.-Kein Netzteil/Ladegerät mehr im Lieferumfang seit iPhone 12. Aus Umweltgründen sind die dadurch verkleinerten Verpackungen zwar sicher ein Vorteil. Und viele Nutzer besitzen schon genug Ladegeräte, aber eben nicht jeder. Aber es gibt auch viele sehr günstige 18W oder 20W-USB C-Netzteile, die zumindest fast genauso schnell laden, wie das Original.-iPhone-Preise in der EU leider deutlich angestiegenNeutral:-Wohl kaum Verbesserung der Tele-Kamera, immer noch nicht mehr als 3x „Zoom“ bzw. mehr Tele-Brennweite. Die Konkurrenz bietet da teilweise deutlich mehr… Nur bei wenig Licht soll sich die Qualität verbessert haben, vermutlich aber nur per Software.-Lightning-Stecker: Ich finde den Lightning-Stecker der iPhones immer noch technisch sehr gut -die Kabel halten sehr gut und der Stecker ist ziemlich robust. Auch mehrfache Abstürze bei einigen iPhones direkt auf den Stecker haben bisher bei mir keinen Schaden verursacht. USB C scheint mir da etwas anfälliger und die Stecker brauchen auch ein wenig mehr Platz.Andererseits gibt es für USB C eben viel mehr Zubehör wie Docks und Adapter -da ist die Auswahl für Lightning leider begrenzter. Aber am Smartphone finde ich das nicht so wichtig, beim iPad finde ich USB C wichtiger. Adapter auf USB und SD-Kartenleser gibt es ja u.a. für Lightning auch.Fazit:Meiner Meinung nach ist das iPhone 14 Pro Max derzeit auf jeden Fall das technisch fortschrittlichste Smartphone am Markt. Die Max-Variante hat inzwischen wohl keine technischen Vorteile mehr zum normalen Pro, außer eben neben Display einem größeren Akku.Für Fotografen und Videofilmer sehe ich das iPhone 14 Pro (Max) jedenfalls als ideale Wahl. Die Videoqualität finde ich toll und für viele Foto-Aufgaben ist es schon komplett ausreichend, wenn auch weiterhin kein Smartphone Vollformat-DSLR/DSLM-Kameras ersetzen kann.Für Nutzer älterer Modelle: Wer noch ein iPhone 12 Pro (Max) nutzt, der wird vor allem deutliche Kamera-Fortschritte sicher zu schätzen wissen, vom 13 Pro(Max) sollte der Unterschied nicht besonders groß sein.Rein die Geschwindigkeit bei der Nutzung hat sich nach meinem Eindruck die letzten Jahre nur leicht verbessert und auch ein 11 Pro oder 12 Pro (Max) können bei den meisten Alltagsaufgaben sehr gut mithalten, selbst ein XS Max finde ich noch schnell genug - auch für etwas anspruchsvollere Nutzer.

Dieses Gerät stellt zwar nur ein minimales, aber solides Upgrade zum Vorgänger dar.Das Display ist knackig scharf und butterweich dank 120 Hz Bildwiederholrate. Der Sound ist super und auch beim Empfang 4G/5G, sowie Telefonie gibt es keine Beschwerden.Die Dynamic Island ist ein nettes Gimmick und wird hoffentlich noch mehr Anwendung finden als bisher.Ein Aufrüsten des Speichers ist nicht möglich, daher sollte vor dem Kauf abgewogen werden, was man braucht bzw. künftig brauchen wird.Mit 1 TB ist man aber immer gut bedient, da 4K Videos und RAW Fotodateien sehr viel Platz brauchen.Der Ultrawide Sensor ist noch immer nicht mit einer optischen Bildstabilisierung ausgestattet…das ist nicht gut, aber verschmerzbar. Der Unterschied der Kamera zum 13 Pro Max ist kaum vorhanden. Wer aber von einem 12er oder älter kommt, wird das Upgrade merken.Noch immer gibt es nur 6GB RAM. Hier wären 8GB mal überfällig.Jedoch weiß das neue Schwarz als Farbe sehr zu gefallen und passt ausnahmslos zu jeder Hülle.Auch hier klare Kaufempfehlung für Leute mit dem nötigen Kleingeld ;-)Auch muss Amazon lobend erwähnt werden, denn ich hatte das Gerät zunächst bei Apple selbst bestellt. Nach wochenlangem Warten stellte sich am Tag wo es ausgeliefert werden sollte und die Tage danach heraus, dass ein UPS Mitarbeiter wohl mehr Lust auf das Gerät und es einfach behalten hatte, obwohl ich es bezahlte…was in einem wochenlangen Hin und Her mündete. ABER bei Amazon lief alles reibungslos und unkompliziert ab. Hier wurde das Gerät sehr schnell und zufriedenstellend geliefert! Dafür nochmals vielen Dank, dass das hier alles SUPER läuft!!!!

Une nouvelle fois, c’est du grand Apple.Pas déçu de mon achat, c’est un achat plaisir que j’ai effectué, mais reste quelques détails à amélioré pour qu’il puisse être parfait.Ayant possédé l’iPhone 12, avant de passer vers l’iPhone 14 Pro Max, la différence se voit tout de suite au niveau de la taille de l’écran et surtout des 3 focus de l’appareil photo, c’est extra la plage d’effet et de filtre que propose l’application « appareil photo ».Côté design, c’est du grand classique étant une grande fan de la marque, c’est un design cylindrique et cette finition propre à la marque quand retrouvé depuis l’iPhone 4 et 4s.La grande nouveauté de cette iPhone 14 Pro Max c’est le Dynamic Island, qui est top, il permet l’affichage simple et intelligent des notifications sur le téléphone (notamment quand en reçoit des appels, messages etc).Pour moi, les futurs axes d’améliorations qu’Apple devrait prévoir sur les nouveaux modèles, c’est de voir le positionnement des objectifs de l’appareil photo qui pour moi commence à devenir redondant et du déjà vu, de plus je remarque que la qualité de l’appareil photo selfie n’est pas vraiment top.Le détecteur de réduction de bruit, n’est pas vraiment vraiment efficace dans des lieux très fréquentés (par ex : rue commerçantes, centre commercial etc). Il faut parfois faire répéter son interlocuteur pour entendre ce qu’il nous dit.Je trouve aussi qu’Apple devrait commencer à réfléchir à alléger l’iPhone tout en proposant un téléphone résistant et de qualité.En conclusion, je recommande cette iPhone, vous ne serez pas déçu, il est simple d’utilisation, agréable à utiliser au quotidien c’est du grand Apple comme d’habitude.

 Ich beziehe mich hier auf meine iPhone 13 Pro Max Bewertung (https://www.amazon.de/gp/customer-reviews/RJSH8YJZQ0YPD) bzw. allgemein ein Vergleich zum Vorgänger.Zum Vorgänger hat sich ""theoretisch"" etwas getan, aber merkt man davon etwas im Alltag!? Ich bin mit meinem 13 Pro Max sehr zufrieden gewesen, daher wird es das 14er schwer haben dieses noch zu ""überbieten"" und am Ende gibt es doch wieder eine ""Verschlechterung"" bei der Kamera.⚪ Gleich geblieben ⚪o Wunderschönes Design (natürlich wieder Geschmackssache), aber die Hochglanzränder sind weiterhin extreme Fingerabdruckmagnete, obwohl sie nun dunkler sindo Qualitativ sehr gut verarbeitet (Optik und Spaltmaße), aber sehr schwer im Gegensatz zur Konkurrenz und die Materialien erwecken einen sehr anfälligen Eindruck, so dass das Handy bei mir sofort in einer Hülle mit Panzerglas (beides von Spigen) gelandet ist - sehr schade, da man nun nichts vom schönen Design siehto Lightning auf USB-C Kabel dabei und immer noch kein USB-C am Geräto Display und Farbwiedergabe wieder mal sehr gut (kein Gelbstich oder ähnliches)o Der Bug, dass bei einer Displayhelligkeit von NULL schwarze Pixel nicht schwarz, sondern grau anzeigt wurden, ist zum Glück weiterhin behobeno Weiterhin sehr gute, wenn nicht sogar die besten, Lautsprecher (in dieser Größe) was Lautstärke und Qualität betrifft!o Das 13 Pro Max hatte eine sehr gute Akkulaufzeit und das 14 Pro Max ""kann"" hier auch mithalten. Warum kann? Je nach aktiviertem Feature, wie z.B. Always-On-Display, hält das 14 Pro Max dann verständlicherweise etwas kürzer durch. Aber wie immer muss man dem iPhone ein paar Tage geben bis es sich ""einpendelt"".✔️ Positives und Negatives zur Kamera ❌+ Allgemein ist die Kamera wieder etwas besser geworden. Warum etwas? Da sie sowieso schon auf einem sehr hohen Niveau ist. Jetzt, je nach Modus, mit 48 MP statt 12 MP. Merkt man die im Alltag? Nicht wirklich!+ Die Makrofunktion wurde nochmal etwas verbessert, ABER ...- ... aktiviert sich aber für meinen Geschmack manchmal schon zu früh+ Videos und Fotos in dunkler Umgebung sehen jetzt nochmal besser aus und ...+ ... der Portraitmodus ist in dunklen Lichtverhältnissen mit dem Tele‑Objektiv (3x und auch 2x) wieder besser geworden (war beim 13er schlechter als beim 12er und machte unscharfe Fotos, wenn von Hand geschossen wurde)-- Was gefühlt schlimmer geworden ist, ist die Objektivverzerrung. Gerade in Aufnahmen auf ""kurze"" Distanz (2-3m), also bei Gruppen oder Personenaufnahmen, verzerren Gesichter deutlich schneller.✔️ Positives und Negatives zum Display+ Dynamic Island statt der Notch. Ich mag die Veränderung und war für mich mit einer der Gründe umzusteigen. Was mir gefällt ist, dass man viele Funktionen mit einem Blick sieht (wie Timer, Musik, etc. pp.), ...- ... allerdings stört es in diversen Apps etwas mehr, da es nun noch weiter ins Bild ragt als die Notch (für mich überwiegt aber der Vorteil)+ nochmal heller als der Vorgänger, was die Benutzung in praller Sonne angenehmer macht+ ProMotion: sieht irgendwie nochmal flüssiger aus oder aktiviert sich schneller bzw. geschmeidiger als beim 13er+ Always-On-Display gefällt mir zwar sehr gut, aber habe ich aufgrund der Akkulaufzeit deaktiviert. Mir wäre eine Status LED (in diversen Farben je nach App) immer noch lieber* * * Fazit * * *Im Grunde hat sich nicht so viel getan zum 13er Pro Max, welches für mich weiterhin das Beste iPhone ist! Lohnt sich also ein Upgrade? Nein, dann würde ich das Geld lieber sparen und eventuell auf das 15er warten. Die einzigen Features die im Alltag auffallen und sinnvoll sein könnten ist die Dynamic Island und das Always-On-Display. Die Kamera macht keine deutlich besseren Fotos als der Vorgänger, so dass sich hier ein Upgrade lohnen würde. Mir viel hier sogar die Objektivverzerrung viel extremer bzw. negativer auf, als bei den anderen beiden Vorgängern. Man hat das Gefühl, dass das Kamerasystem mehr auf Landschaftsfotografie ausgelegt worden ist, als auf ""normale"" bzw. ""nahe"" Distanz.Wenn die Rezension hilfreich war, würde ich mich über ein ""Nützlich"" sehr freuen. 👍

Ich nutze ein iPhone seit dem ersten iPhone überhaupt, mit wenigen Ausnahmen hatte ich alle Modelle.Nebenher aber auch immer Android Geräte, aktuell das Galaxy S21 Ultra und Note 20 Ultra, sowie das Z-Fold 4. Dabei geht es mir fast immer nur um die Kamera. Voreingenommen, oder Markengebunden bin also ich keinesfalls.Nun zum aktuellen iPhone 14 Pro Max.Zuvor hatte bzw. habe ich immer noch, dass iPhone 12 Pro Max, das 13 Pro Max habe ich übersprungen.Das 12 Pro Max wandert nun in die Vitrine.Ich gehe nicht auf alle technischen Einzelheiten ein, denn die dürften bekannt sein.Was ich aber aus persönlicher Erfahrung konstatieren kann ist folgendes:Die Kamera ist der absolute Wahnsinn. Fotografie ist seit Jahrzehnten meine Leidenschaft, daher weiß ich, worauf ich achten muss. In noch keinem anderen Smartphone habe ich eine derart überragende Kamera erleben dürfen. Selbst einige meiner HighEnd Digitalkameras, wie Sony RX100 VII haben da massiver Schwierigkeiten mitzuhalten. Selbst meine Alpha 7 III macht nicht alles besser.Die Abbildungsleistung, die Detailtreue und der ausgewogene Nachtmodus beeindrucken mich tief. Die Makrofunktion ist ausgewogen und sorgt für viel Spaß. Der Pro RAW Modus ist genial gelöst, macht er die Qualität nochmals besser und erlaub es dem Fotografen alle Eingriffe professionell vorzunehmen.Damit kann man gestalten und im Nachhinein die Situation retten, wenn es einmal schnell gehen musste.Der Telebereich wurde leicht angehoben und erfüllt die meisten Ansprüche. Selbst höhere Zoombereiche sind machbar, auch wenn die dann digital aufbereitet werden, sind sie doch imponierend gut.Benötigt man mehr Tele, wie ich das oftmals brauche, muss man jedoch zu anderen Phones greifen. Daher nutze ich nebenher das Samsung S21 Ultra und sobald es vorgestellt wird, werde ich das S23 Ultra erwerben.Die Kamera des iPhone 14 Pro Max wurde in den letzten Tagen von vielen namhaften und anerkannt seriösen Profifotografen weltweit mit viel lob, regelrecht überhäuft. Zu Recht, wie ich es selbst erleben darf. Sie überzeugt auf allen Ebenen und das nachhaltig und beeindruckend.Der Akku begeistert nach wie vor. 2-3 Tage, bei meinem Nutzungsverhalten sind kein Problem.Das iPhone 14 Pro Max ist ansonsten ein Feinschliff auf allen Ebenen. Sei es die hervorragende Konsistenz des iOS in Bezug auf die Hardware. Oder die geniale Integration der Notch in die Dynamic Island. Eine Lösung, die elegant und intelligent zugleich ist.Genau das macht Apple aus. feinschliff, statt dieses Hecheln nach den Superlativen. Immer ruhig, aber stringent alles verbessern, unaufgeregt.Natürlich das iPhone schwer, natürlich ist die Kamera groß. Wie soll das auch anders sein, wenn man diese Leistung fordert und dann schlussendlich auch bekommt. Wer das nicht möchte, der muss sich ein kleineres Modell kaufen. Wer seine Präferenzen woanders sieht, für den gibt es genug Auswahl.Doch mit einem iPhone, wie dem 14 Pro Max, bekommt man das derzeit beste Gesamtpaket aus Software, Hardware und Leistungsfähigkeit. Ein Gerät das 5-7 Jahre mit Updates unterstützt wird, jedes Jahr, zeitgleich, weltweit.Kritisieren könnte man den immer noch vorhandenen Lightning Anschluss, doch das wäre Jammern auf hohem Niveau.⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  Ich bin jedenfalls rundherum zufrieden und kann hier eine glasklare Kaufempfehlung und aussprechen und 5 Sterne vergeben.

Et bien… il s’agit bien du téléphone conformément à l’annonce.Pour ce qui est du produit en lui même il s’agit d’un bon produit, ou l’on paye le prix et où l’on ressent enfin une montée de gamme ainsi que de la nouveauté !Pour ce qui est de amazon, livraison prévue dans 5 jours, livré plus tôt que prévue, le lendemain.Rien à dire, si vous le souhaitez, si vous hésitez, prenez le, vous ne le regretterez pas.

Upgrading from IPhone 13 Pro Max , the differences are few, considering the dynamic island to be the biggest one.  Overall the quality of the phone is top notch , as usually. There is also an improvement at the cameras , which is even better.In conclusion, if you are already at the Apple ecosystem this device will not disappoints you.As if it's worth upgrading from 13 Pro Max , this is something that I cannot say it for sure  , depends on how often you are used to change devices.

Alors déja je tien à souligner sois la chance, sois l’effort d’Amazon d’avoir fais l’effort que je le reçois avant Noël ( date initiale 9 Janvier) donc malgré tout ils ont assurés. Ensuite concernant l’iphone pour ma part je passe d’un Iphone 12 pro max a un iphone 14 pro max, j’ai tout de suite remarqué l’écran. La rapidité et la force du GPU cet iphone est magnifique. L’a couleur Violet intense parcontre est belle mais a mon gout tire un peu vers le noir faut bien regarder pour voir la différence un peu déçue par rapport a cela car au final j’aurais pu l’avoir plutôt encore car je voulais absolument la couleur violet intense, sinon RAS tout est niquel.

Dieses Modell ist viel erfolgreicher als das vorherige, da das iPhone 13 Pro Max die Kamera nicht gut fokussieren konnte.  Ich möchte erwähnen, dass der Preis etwas hoch ist, da die Änderungen des neuen Modells nicht groß sind

9155,B0BDHZ7BQD,5,"
Das beste iPhone was ich bisher mein Eigen nennen durfte. Die Ergebnisse der Kamera sind nahezu auf Profi Niveau, das 120Hz OLED Display macht einfach Spaß. Der Sprung vom 11er aufs 14er war sehr lohnenswert. Auch die Dynamic Island ist eine tolle Neuerung und jedes mal aufs Neue ein Hingucker. Einzig der Preis ist Apple typisch völlig überzogen, aber mir ist es das Wert. Empfehlung meinerseits!

zu meinem iPhone 12 Pro Max. Die Specs brauche ich nicht anzuführen die gibt es bei Apple umfassend. Zum Telefon, ich habe den Eindruck das Display ist heller schärfer und reagiert schneller. Die Verbindungen sind stabil und gut, Air sowie Wifi. Da ich nur eine Hand, die linke habe ist es für mich wichtig das iPhone einhändig bedienen zu können, und meine Hand ist keine ""Bratpfanne"", dies funkioniert wegen der schnellen und genauen Funktion des Displays sehr gut Nun aber zum Zuckerstück des iPone 14 Pro Max die Kamera. Da muss ich sagen, sehr gut, die farbtreue, die tiefenschärfe, ein gut und schnell laufender Zoom ein guter HDR Modus. Mit dem entsprechenden Bildbearbeitungsprogramm lassen sich mit den Bilder hervorragende Bilder erzeugen. Fazit, ich bin zufrieden und mehr will ich nicht.

Wer ein IPhone 13 Pro hat, für den rechnet sich das Upgrade nicht. Bei der 128GB Variante ist der ProRes Modus nur für 1080P / 30 fps freigeschaltet, also wer mit 4K mit ProRes filmen möchte muss noch tiefer in die Tasche greifen und eine Variante mit mehr Speicher kaufen. Ansonsten macht das Handy aber echt Spaß, besonders die „Dynamic Island“ gefällt mir. Es ist einfach mal was neues fürs Auge und eine kleine Spielerei. Der Akku ist wirklich ein Monster und hält zumindest bei mir locker 2 Tage trotz relativ intensiver Benutzung. Insgesamt macht das Handy einen sehr Qualitativ hochwertigen Eindruck, liegt schön in der Hand und die Performance ist auch beeindruckend.

Ob 1449€ für das Pro Max preislich in Ordnung  ist,  das entscheidet jeder für sich . Wer es unbedingt haben will bestellt es jetzt . Lieferzeit ist sehr lang aber dafür kann Amazon ja nix und es ist ja auch bekannt warum es so ist .

Switched from Samsung S21 Plus, and I went into it not expecting to like it that much, I just heard social media apps are better optimized for IOS and since I need them for my work I decided to go for it.I was pleasantly surprised! Apps really do work so much better, and the user experience is more smooth overall. The only complaint I have is that the numbers aren’t on the main keyboard and I want the option to add them there, and it feels a little bit slow in comparison to Samsung, as if all the animations are weighing the phone down.Other than that, I’m loving the change!

Ich hatte bisher ein iPhone 11 Pro benutzt und wollte unbedingt auf Max umsteigen. Daher habe ich mir das iPhone 14 Pro Max zugelegt. Das iPhone 14 Pro Max hat mich bis jetzt positiv beeindruckt.Der Unterschied zu meinem alten iPhone ist enorm. Das iPhone 14 Pro Max ist flüssiger, leistungsstarker und und schneller. Über die Kamera muss ich echt nicht viel schreiben. Sie ist faszinierend. Die Bildauflösung ist sehr hoch. Dadurch steigt auch die Qualität der Fotos, die man macht. Die Farbe Dunkellila hat mich begeistert. Sie lässt das iPhone edel wirken und ist zudem eine ziemlich extravagante Farbe. Im Großen und Ganzen kann ich berichten, dass ich mit den iPhone sehr zufrieden bin. Einen Stern ziehe ich wegen dem hohen Preis ab und dass es zu dem Preis keinen Adapter zum Laden dazu gibt.

I upgraded to the iPhone 14 Pro Max from an iPhone XS.So far the battery life is exactly what apple has promised. I am a rather light user. I typically browse the news when I’m traveling to work, perhaps listen to some music for my hour long commute. Same commute back home. And I still have more than 50% battery life!Such a huge improvement from my iPhone XS which could hardly make it through to evening.I like that the camera has now a wide angle lens, a 3 times zoom telephoto lens and something called cinematic mode which I still have to try out.All in all, I am very much impressed and happy that I bought this phone.

Ich benutze seit 2013 hauptsächlich iPhones, mit 2 Android Handys, die als Zweitgerät benutzt wurden/werden. Mein Handy davor war ein 12 Pro Max welches ich geliebt habe. Wie immer fing mein 12PM an zu spinnen, sobald neuere Modelle erschienen. Das war zur Zeit der 13er Serie so (bei der waren die Neuigkeiten nicht einen Wechsel Wert), dasselbe passierte auch mit der 14er Serie, bei der musste aber nun ein neues Handy her.Ja die Dynamic Island sieht toll aus und wird, sobald sich mehrere Apps angepasst haben, sogar etwas besseres; Ja der Kinomodus ist toll, man kann aus allem ein Meisterstück kreieren; Und ja, das Akku hält etwas besser als mein 12PM (mit nur 82% Akkukapazität), aber hier hört es auch schon auf.Wenn ich die Möglichkeit hätte, würde ich das Gerät zurücksenden, ich bin kurz davor direkt zu Apple zu rennen aber gedulde mich noch.Die Kamera war (und teilweise ist immer noch) eine Katastrophe.Zu Beginn dauerte es bis zu 11 Sekunden, bis die Kamera reagierte (also konnte man spontane Fotoaufnahmen vergessen), da meine Geduld zu dem Zeitpunkt schon am Ende war, weiß ich nicht wie lange es tatsächlich maximal bräuchte. Also musste ich stets die Kamera App aus dem Hintergrund entfernen (schließen) und neustarten. Es passierte also nicht nur in den Apps von Drittanbietern.Normale Videos sind furchtbar, man sieht den Übergang zum Makromodus, da kann ich mittlerweile fast keine Videos mehr aufnehmen, ohne Brüche in der Aufnahme festzustellen. Da ich Produktaufnahmen, Social Media Content und weiteres aufnehme, ist dies für mich ein No-No-No!Viele Apps stürzen auch nach mehreren Updates ab, sollte sich zwar bald beruhigen sobald es wieder ein Update gibt oder die App Hersteller an der Kompatibilität geschraubt haben, nervt aber trotzdem.Ich weiß, dass viele von diesen (und dutzenden weiteren) Problemen durch diverse Updates beseitigt werden (können) aber ehrlich gesagt finde ich die Preise in Deutschland eh eine Frechheit, dann auch noch ein Gerät zu erhalten, welches noch nicht ausgereift ist, finde ich absurd.Ich habe das 512GB Modell nur ausgewählt weil es das einzige schnell lieferbare war, musste also nochmal tiefer in die Geldtasche greifen aber bin sehr enttäuscht. Mein nächstes Handy wird kein iPhone sein, das steht schon mal fest.

Sehr zufrieden!Mega schnelle Leistung. Always-on-display ist für mich sehr von Vorteil (obwohl der Akku vielleicht deswegen ein bisschen leidet), da ich nicht immer den Bildschirm anfassen muss, um zu sehen was für eine Mitteilung ich bekommen habe, oder wie spät es ist. Face-ID im Landscape-Modus. Tolle Kameras (besonders mit 48 MP in RAW Format). Heller Bildschirm für draußen in der Sonne. Sehr gute Lautsprecher und sogar ist die ""Dynamic Island"" besser und schöner als gedacht.

 The first time I used an iPhone … I found it a wonderful device, excellent features that suit me very much, but I have a small remark. I hope Apple will listen to me. My problem is I wish them to make a phone with a stylus, as Samsung does, because this helps me a lot in my work.  Thank you and I wish you further progress

Ich ersetze mit dem iPhone 14 Pro Max mein mittlerweile vier Jahre altes Xs Max, da ich nicht zu den Menschen gehöre, die jedes Jahr das neueste Modell besitzen müssen. Und das Upgrade ist in dem Fall schon deutlich. Es ist extrem schnell, das Display ist äußerst hell und scharf und die Kamera macht wirklich brillante Bilder. Zudem bin ich mit 5G nun auch auf dem aktuellen Stand. Always-On benötige und nutze ich nicht. Was mir nicht so gefällt ist der Kamerabuckel, welcher beim Xs Max deutlich dezenter ausfällt. Auch der Preis ist mittlerweile recht schmerzhaft. Wenn es sich aber genau so wacker schlägt wie mein Xs Max, dann kann man das wohl noch verkraften. Amazon und DPD haben übrigens verlässlich und pünktlich geliefert.

I like the build quality of Apple products, and the iPhone 14 Plus makes no exception. The cameras are amazing, especially if you use them with a third party app. It is not much more to say about this phone, it does what it should do and it is very reliable. The only minus point is that in 2022 we still have the old lighting port instead of the much faster usb c.

Die technischen Sprünge zwischen den iPhone-Generationen sind nicht mehr so groß wie in früheren Jahren, jedoch kommen gleichwohl jedes Jahr neue sinnvolle Verbesserungen hinzu.USB-C wäre sicherlich auch schon für das 14er wünschenswert gewesen, aber das ist sicherlich klagen auf hohem Niveau.Kritiker die einen Mangel an Neuerungen ausgemacht haben, müssen die aktuelle Generation ja nicht kaufen. Für alle anderen ist es ein super Smartphone, welches einen gut durch den Tag bringt und tolle Fotos schießt.

Habe seit dem iphone 3GS iphones und mein letzter Wechsel war nun vom 11 pro zum 14 pro max. Grundsätzlich wie üblich ein gutes Gerät. Nur die Neuerungen auch bei einem größeren Sprung (11 pro auf 14 pro max) sind zu vernachlässigen. Es gibt eigentlich in meinen Augen nur noch wenige Features die für ein ""Must-have"" taugen. Das Hauptaugenmerk auf die Kamera finde ich auch nicht so toll (vielleicht für Spezialisten unabdingbar) - auch mein 11 pro hat schon super Fotos gemacht. Dynamic Island - nett, aber auch nicht mehr. Satelliten-Notruf - steht im wahrsten Sinn des Wortes in den Sternen, wann dieses Feature für Europa aktiviert wird. Hauptsächliche Gründe für den Wechsel bei mir waren: besseres Display (ja das ist durchaus merklich) und die bessere Akkulaufzeit. Der Wow-Effekt ist aber bei diesem Wechsel ausgeblieben.

Hab jetzt immer ein Jahr ausgesetzt und zuvor das iPhone 12 Pro Max gehabt jetzt das iPhone 14 Pro Max, werde es zurück schicken. Keins der ,,neuen,, Merkmale rechtfertigt den Preis und ich bin wirklich ein Apple jünger. Also gehts zurück, wenn ihr nen 13 pro habt mach das Upgrade noch weniger Sinn. Leider ist der Wert Verfall durch die Marktsättigung inzwischen auch zu spüren. Also lieber iPhone 13 Pro und warten oder in den saueren Apfel beißen.

Beim Transfer der Daten stürzte das Teil ab und der Bildschirm blieb schwarz. Reset. Nochmal.Endlich läuft es.Die Farben des Bildschirms sind übersättigt, soll wohl dadurch ""hochwertiger"" wirken. Die Kamerasensoren auf der Rückseite sind riesengroß, wie bei einem Chinahandy.Apropos China:Bei der Bedienung kommt plötzlich nervige Werbung. Apple braucht mehr Geld: Für ""Apple Arcade"" und irgendwelchen anderen Konsumkram. Alles im Abo natürlich.Apps gibts nur im Store. Manuelle Installation? Fehlanzeige.Netzteil? Muss man extra kaufen. Klimaschutz. Na klar. Als ob das bei nem 1500 Euro Smartphone noch ne Rolle spielen würde.Keine Ahnung wie man als Marktführer mit so nem lausigen Produkt kommen kann.

 Bonsoir, j’ai acheté l’iPhone 14 pro max chez vous et lorsque je film la caméra se met à vibrer et un bruit étrange sonne à l’intérieur du téléphone.Pouvez vous s’il vous plaît me faire un retour afin de trouver une solution ?

no issue with the phoneit was the state of the packaging from amazon -  surprised the phone  arrived in one piece

Refurbished IPhone 12. Immaculate and half the price of a new iPhone 14

I am out of words to say that one is perfect phone for me.

Am a regular apple user and this phone is great. I don’t think you need the latest model.  The facial recognition makes it quicker to open. Camera good quality too.

Overall a very good phone, and serves its purpose- finally replaced my old iPhone 7.  It needs a bit of getting used to slid to the next screen.Saved £££ during Prime Day.  Items arrived opened box and without a manual- but received an extra discount.  Very pleased with the extra saving!

I had one of these a while ago but it was the first that Apple brought out. When I got a new Apple I passed it onto the wife and she thought it was great, years pass and the phone packs up ( the battery) so I bought her the iPhone 12 upgraded version it’s taken a while to get her bearings on it but she getting there!
"
9260,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
As expected
"
9261,B08L5RZ8QJ,4,"
So the phone works amazing had it for a good few months now and has done me wonders but the only problem is the battery seems to not last as long as it should do I don’t know if it got damaged on the way or that’s me just having to much of expectations but other than that I would recommend having this phone
"
9262,B08L5RZ8QJ,4,"
Battery life is good nice colour all in all a good phone

My last iPhone was the 1st Gen iPhone SE in 2016, it was great however it had a small 32GB storage, I got rid of it because I kept running out of space and iCloud drive wasn't great at the time, hence I got the 256GB capacity iPhone 12Been on Android for 5 years and it's been a welcome return back to iPhone, the phone is smooth, animations are immediate, FaceID has never let me down, with Apple's 20W charger, the charge time is pretty good too. iPhone 12 has wireless charging which makes it perfect to charge conveniently in the car.Battery life is okay, nothing to write home about, I'm a power user and I can get 6 hours of screen on time day to day, and very rarely have I killed it in one day.Design wise, if you loved the iPhone 4, you'll love this, it's an extension of that design idea, not slippery to hold like previous iPhones, this is Apple at it's best when it comes to industrial design.Highly recommend the iPhone 12, I think it's the pick of the bunch since the Pro models have the same A14 processor and unless you really want LiDAR and the extra macro camera, I think this is the pick of the bunch.

I bought it for my son and he loves it.  It works smoothly, it perfectly lies in the hand.  Very fast delivery

Ordered to replace my iPhone 11. Phone has a great camera, facial recognition, easy to use, clear screen quality etc… but the battery does not last long at all. I feel I am constantly having to charge it up where I could have the same usage with my iPhone 11 and the battery would last all day.
"
9270,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
A real bargain from Amazon warehouse. Came in pristine condition 100% battery and 9 months of Apple care still on the phone.Happy customer and would definitely look at finding the same deal again in the future
"
9271,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
This was a replacement for my ageing iPhone 7plus and it was worth the wait. I got this before the iPhone 13 was release at a very good price, its screen, battery life and speed are all excellent and with the longevity of the apple devices and the support for several years of updates I had no hesitation to buy another over the android devices that have very poor support for anything more than one year. I have been delighted with the ease of migrating data from one phone to the next which used wireless pairing and seamless migration of everything from my old phone to the new one. The camera is also excellent and its a nice device to hold too. Shame I have to put it in a case for work due to the hostile environments I work in. Otherwise I would recommend this to those looking for an upgrade from an older device at a more affordable price
"
9272,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Had to send my XR back bad connection problems but usual excellent customer service from Amazon so decided to upgrade to a 12 not a lot of cosmetic difference between them nothing seem to change much on the working aspect of the phones keep giving fancy write ups re the camera but sadly a picture is a picture to me I don’t see the difference between any photos never really grasp the extortionate prices for I phones one is much like the other if you compare them on apples compare I phones there is very little difference in the phone apart from the price legalised extortion by apple really had all different models of iPhones since their conception only had trouble with the XR but the warranty covered that so see how this one goes
"
9273,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
The only thing I was pleasantly surprised about after a few days usage is the battery life, which I expected to be worse after reading other reviews. I'm coming from an iPhone 7 Plus that I used for 4 years, so I was expecting to notice the upgrade. I easily manage to get 30-40% charge at the end of the day with normal use (about 1h in voice calls, 15 minutes videocall, occasional YouTube videos, texting and 3-4 pictures throughout the day).I'm not using the camera for pictures and videos much, as I prefer using my Fujifilm mirrorless for photography.I love the blue color, but I am biased as it is my favorite. I was tempted by the black one, which I believe is going to be the most picked one. Face ID works like a charm. It's unfortunate we are in a pandemic and wear masks when shopping, so Face ID won't work for contactless payments. It does quickly switch to passcode though, so you can avoid removing your face covering, as you are not supposed to. I have tried recommended methods to make it work with a face covering, but it did not work for me.

9274,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
The iPhone 12 is a brilliant phone. I originally had an iPhone 8 and upgraded to the 12. The camera is brilliant - the pictures come out so crisp and look amazing. I like the more rounder edges of this iPhone as well. I got the iPhone 12 in blue and it looks so great, the picture of it doesn’t do it justice! The only downside of this is that due to the price I’d have hoped to have got headphones and I thankfully already had a mains plug but if someone else was buying an apple product for the first time then you will need to buy one or you aren’t able to charge your phone. The size is of this phone is great too, I’m so glad I didn’t go for the bigger size because this can fit into your pocket perfectly. I love that this has face recognition (what did I do before this?!) it’s so much easier to use now even though with having to use masks all the time right now it isn’t difficult for that but worth it if you aren’t needing to use Apple Pay!
"
9275,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
I purchased the iPhone 12 to replace my iPhone SE on which the battery was failing and needed recharging more than once a day. As soon as I received the new phone (the day after I ordered it, excellent service) I transferred the contents to the new phone without having to get assistance, so other than being a bit bigger it is as easy to use as the last phone. The keyboard is bigger so easier for me to type. Face recognition, the first time I have used it is brilliant but I fear I may forget my passwords as it is easier to use. All in all it is a great phone I haven’t used the camera yet, but I’m pretty sure it will be better than my old phone. Now charging once every two days, for now. I can only say that I love iPhones and think they are worth the extra money.👍

9276,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
The last time I bought a new iPhone was in 2011, since then I’ve always bought 2nd hand because of the cost, but this time Amazon let me get the phone on monthly payments.I went for the iPhone 12 256GB and WOW, I was impressed the 1st night I had it. I’m a photo taker and this phone just amazes me with the quality of the camera alone. All the photos were taken at night with NO flash and they look amazing.Siri listens for the 1st time ever!It’s soooooo loud compared to my old 7s Plus, it’s almost like I have a soundbar in my pocket!I love the colour, I went for the Green one, well it is different!It’s seriously fast too, once I ordered a 5G sim from my provider that is!I have zero complaints about the phone, worth the money as I know it will last!

I am happy with my phone and the option of pay few pound per month interest free for 12 month

9278,B08L5RZ8QJ,4,"
I like it, battery long life, the phone so good.
"
9279,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Expensive for what it is, but then all the newest phones are.It is a nice phone though and I feel if you’ve had multiple iphones in the past, you know what it’s all about. It’ll take some adjusting to without having a home button at the bottom and a few additional button combinations and swipe patterns to get used.The camera’s are a noticeable improvement, and I do like the face id to unlock - and when I’m wearing a face mask it will still unlock if it detects I’m wearing my apple watch so it knows it’s me.The bigger screen is nice and I’m hoping the battery lasts longer with it being bigger but I have to say I do like having a phone you can operate with 1 hand and this does require 2 to reach all extremities of the screen.
"
9280,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
I like it. No problem with it just like it’s says in description. Brand new. No damages. Working perfectly.
"
9281,B08L5RZ8QJ,4,"
It's fairly responsive in touch and speed with opening appsThe camera doesn't feel that much improved but it's still very goodI'd say the best thing about the phone is the better CPU allow smooth operation and of course a better battery lifeI've given 4 stars due to the fact that Apple take the  liberty of removing earphones, chargers or adapters. I sincerely hope other companies don't follow suit.It's crazy enough paying almost 1k for phones nowadays and to receive nothing else additional feels like robbery
"
9282,B08L5RZ8QJ,3,"
Nothing special. Same as all iPhones. Only stay due to my music collection
"
9283,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"

I bought this iPhone two days ago and it arrived today. I confess I was so afraid of being robbed on the way from UK to Dublin. Well, thank Gosh it didn't happen. I got it, recharged, put my acc on it, all my apps, SIM card and everything is absolutely fantastic. I don't think I need to write about the performance of the phone (because it's awesome) but I am sure to recommend if you are looking for a phone here in Amazon, check the sellers and the reviews and pray :DThank you
"
9289,B08L5RZ8QJ,4,"
Phone arrived on time, the currier arrived to the door and we both was scared on the trade of parcel for password and at the end we made safe; nothing wrong with the currier, the shipping was excellent. I turned on the phone and the system started with aggressive configurations and queries for phone identifier, I text a software engineer in the group to restore IMEI and component serial, technically the amazon control team was using a foreign country identification for myself name, and I am attending the reset to first start of the phone to obtain primary original IOS addons and amazon shopping reference in UK.
"
9290,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
This is definitely my favourite iphone I have had so far, the design is great and feels really nice to hold and feels really smooth to use with its fast speeds, the camera takes really nice clear pictures and the video quality is great, also the sound from the speakers is great and loud which is good when watching videos and listing to music on, the screen size is also perfect for me as not to big and not to small, nice to watch YouTube and other videos on and also good for gaming as games also run nice and smooth. This is the perfect mobile phone for me as does everything i want and just the right size. Highly recommend this iphone as very happy with it.
"
9291,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Bought this phone sim free to replace my old iPhone 6s Plus. Fantastic phone that I’ve just had for over a week now and I love it. Really impressed by the quality of camera too. Great purchase!
"
9292,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Apple rarely disappoint because they follow a formula that works. If you have used iPhone in the last 5 years. You come to expect what iPhone’s are capable with. This iPhone was purchased as an upgrade from an iPhone 8 Plus for my mum and it is an healthy upgrade. If you have an 11 or XR maybe wait till 14 because by that point their should be a noticeable upgrade.
"
9293,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
We always save up and purchase our phones out right and then get a monthly sim only deal as you save a fortune over a 2/3 year contract. This iPhone isn’t all bells and whistles - not a huge difference from our previous iPhone 7 Plus - however the camera is significantly better and the battery life lasts a whole day without charging and the face recognition is quick and easy - even wearing glasses or a mask! . Having said that, I probably don’t use all the features on it - so may be missing out on some major upgrades - but for my needs it’s perfect.We are an Apple family and love them and if that’s the case, would recommend this phone.
"
9294,B08L5RZ8QJ,4,"
Very good Smartphone - like ever - but one important thing is missing: FingerPrint reader. Nowadays where we are constantly using masks, just face recognition is not enough. It should have kept the fingerprint reader - in the same way I have in my old iPhone 8.I have a Xiaomi that costs 30% - and IT contains both, face and fingerprint options. This is a very expensive product, should bring everything - including the charger... come on!
"
9295,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Used Android phones for years, pretty much every pixel phone, and quite a few samsungs, thought it was time to try an iphone.Love it, nice design, quality, great camera and battery life.Everything about it feels premium.
"
9296,B08L5RZ8QJ,3,"
Pros:It gives premium feel and rich experience, which is obvious.Camera is really good which iPhone is known for.Cons:Sometime it hangs all of a sudden. The app icons doesn't work at all. And I must restart the phone to make it work again. It may be one device issue but it shouldn't be even for one device given the price.While talking on WhatsApp call, my voice won't go through if the other person is talking.
"
9297,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Switching from Android to an iPhone for the 1st time was an adjustment but the phone is really easy to use, camera is great, battery life very good.All in all very pleased with the iphone 12
"
9298,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
I bought this as an upgrade from iPhone 8. Love the face recognition , easy to set up from my old phone.Camera is better. And bigger screen.
"
9299,B08L5RZ8QJ,4,"
I moved to iphone from samsung just for camera quality. however if you are looking for best pictures, u still need to go for pro or even pro max. Before buying, i watched quite alot of youtube videos which compare the cameras and donot really find a big difference. In real life, when you put both iphone 12 and pro cameras together, it makes a difference in my personal view. Especially when it is dark, or complete opposite too bright ! So if you are buying mainly for camera and paying this money, just try yo go for pro if you can, if not, it is a great phone, great battery life, super fast... best iphone generation...
"
9300,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Came in perfect conditions. No complaints
"
9301,B08L5RZ8QJ,4,"
My previous phone was an iPhone X and in its case the C fitted in most of my pockets the IPhone 12 is just a little bigger and once in the wallet it does not fit in most of my pockets
"
9302,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Absolute disappointment. Never had so many issues with network connection on any devices I owned. Week mobile  reception, Wi-Fi is the worst won't connect or stay connected. Total garbage. Will sell it and never look on iphone again. Even Friking Poco F3 does better job for less than half price.
"
9303,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
I am very satisfied with this phone. For my needs it’s absolutely fine: wonderful pictures, battery life is good, easy to use!
"
9304,B08L5RZ8QJ,4,"
My old iPhone 7 broke. Bought this iPhone 12 to replace it. The colour blue is okay as expected. The bigger screen is what i wanted. Other functions are all similar to my iPhone 7, so i had no problem using it. It takes better pictures, comfortable to hold, battery life is okay so far as i turned icloud back-up off so the battery life lasts longer. I am quite happy with it.
"
9305,B08L5RZ8QJ,4,"
This is a replacement for my iPhone 5, which tho working fine, could no longer download apps! 🤬. Love the phone & colour & all its additions. Size is great as my eyes are not. Only downside is the keys are a bit too small & I keep hitting wrong ones.
"
9306,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Would take a photo but can’t because I’m using the phone because it’s so good! It’s apple so you should expect it to be good. Came well packed and I damaged. Came on the day it said and was perfect.
"
9307,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
It’s Apple and it’s an iPhone and as expected it’s exactly what I wanted. Face recognition is a massive improvement on using a finger.
"
9308,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
I’ve been needing to get a new phone for months and originally I was going to get an iPhone 11 but after the 11 being out of stock EVERYWHERE, I decided to buy the 12 since Amazon offered a pay-monthly scheme for it. The payments are £145.80 spread over 5 months which is really good and overall works out cheaper for me.The colour is gorgeous, the camera is excellent and overall it’s a very good phone. Really pleased :)
"
9309,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Great phone, not a fan of the lack of a headphone port
"
9310,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
My iPhone 7 was no longer keeping up so I took the plunge for a new phone. The technology is mind boggling and the device is beautiful.  Facial recognition works even in the dark making this phone even more user friendly and convenient.
"
9311,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Great phone, good price.
"
9312,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Can’t go wrong
"
9313,B08L5RZ8QJ,4,"
Great phone, a lot of money but they usually last long. The finishing on the back (shiny on the standard 12) is a bit annoying as it gets full of fingertips, the lack of headphones and charging brick is a joke for the money you spend.The building quality is amazing, the software is brilliant and the transition from another iPhone is amazing.
"
9314,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
I bought this for my son and I don't know the first thing about technology but I know that he wanted a iPhone so I read the reviews and decided to buy it for him off Amazon, I checked around to make sure I was paying the right price and I do trust Amazon so my thinking was if it's not what he wants I can return it and get a full refund. He loves it and says it's much better than the phone he had which isn't a iPhone but a good one nethertheless. He went for a walk and sent me the above picture on his new iphone it was getting dark and the quality is exceptional compared to his old phone. He said it's brilliant and would highly recommend it.
"
9315,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Just bought this iPhone 12 in purple beautiful phone really great price on Amazon thank you! Very easy to set up and install from your old iPhone there is definitely a difference between the iPhone 11 and this iPhone 12 well worth buying this is  my favourite iPhone and I’ve  ever owned and I’ve had iPhones  since iPhone 4 very good experience buying from Amazon as i was able to pay monthly interest free instead of outright like I’ve done previously with apple just noticed it’s 20 % off today so even more reason to buy this stunning iPhone  from apple via Amazon as far cheaper than apple store
"
9316,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Great phone and easy to use.
"
9317,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Really nice phone to be honest. Always been an android user. Slowly been moving over to apple devices elsewhere and decided for this upgrade to switch. The eco system is fantastic and the iPhone 12 just completes it. The battery life is phenomenal, I’m not glued to my phone so obviously your mileage will vary. But it always last the day and will charge to 80% to preserve the life of the battery. As I don’t require a full charge each day. Really snappy and hasn’t let me down once yet on the 3 months I’ve had it.
"
9318,B08L5RZ8QJ,3,"
All my Busines and family activity.I should not  have bought it. Facial recognition good. Battery life awful. Should gone for iPhone 13.
"
9319,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
I changed from an 11 Pro Max to the 12 because I like to keep up to date, even though to be honest it doesn't feel any faster because it shares the same gig mem. But I was a little tired of the weight and size of the 11 Pro Max and enjoy the smaller form factor of the 12. Though I must say I didn't see the phone in person (in an Apple store) before I purchased online, and I wouldn't call it red, more like a dark salmon in colour. If I had seen it in person first, I would have gone for another colour. But then again, after the case is on, all I see is the camera cut out.
"
9320,B08L5RZ8QJ,3,"
I’ve had an iPhone 6s for some years and decided to upgrade to an iPhone 12. I thought I’d notice a difference but apart from having lots of storage I’m disappointed with my new phone, nothing seems any different with it, for example battery life is still poor, downloading speed still quite slow etc, not sure it was worth the money
"
9321,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
I decided to buy a new phone as opposed to a secondhand phone, although it’s very expensive it’s what I have been using for years! Still working out how everything works!
"
9322,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
This iPhone 12 have been amazing the battery life would last even the whole day I love it only thing I dislike is that we weren’t given a proper charger
"
9323,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
iPhone 12, is a phone worth purchasing. I found it abit challenging at first not being able to find my way around the interface, however, now I have adjusted, thumbs up.Face recognition is new to me and I now find it very useful when not wearing a mask 😂. Battery life is excellent.I also like the feature were I can set it on 4G/5G.
"
9324,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
The iPhone 12 is superb it is the perfect middle of the road phone. Its updated to latest specs and software does what ever is needed.Its an excellent phone its screen is the perfect size, especially now that I just upgraded from iPhone 7. so its a world of a difference. the only issues are the price it is overpriced and the faceID which I feel is a step down from the more secure touchID and too much of a gimmick.The battery is outstanding it literally lasts all day - 2 days without recharge especially if you’re a light user!A superb all around phone.
"
9325,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
The phone is as expected.However just pray you don’t have any issues.I had issues and Amazon and Amazon’s customer service is simply shocking.You pay over £800 for a phone and have a problem within 24 hours, I expect a replacing phone not a repair!!I ended up going to the apple store in birmingham who sorted the phone.I’ll never buy an item like this from Amazon again
"
9326,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
I have been an android user since I switched from my iPhone 4 back in 2011. This design really takes me back and I’ve got to admit Apple have done a superb job here.I’ve recently used the pixel 2xl and the pixel 3a and considering google have done a really good job with their own stripped back software, for me it’s nowhere near to Apple.The iPhone 12 feels and looks premium and the iOS is a game changer compared to Android.Personally I prefer to purchase my phones out right than sign up to a 24 month contract. Depending on what sim deal you can find you could save around £400 to £600 over 2 years so it’s always worth checking.Overall it’s a great iPhone and looks fantastic in blue.!
"
9327,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Nothing new
"
9328,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
This is a perfect phone. Perfect size ,weight, smooth and elegant design. Impressive battery life for an above average user. I recommend a 256 GB. The only area I am very slightly disappointed is the screen response and touch ( typing) not bad though. I felt the phone is slightly overpriced from that perspective. I also recommend  a green one . And also,I think i phone 12 is the perfect one unless you are OK with very heavy and big phones. I felt like the money I spent on this phone is not useless.  Go ahead and get it. You will not be disappointed.
"
9329,B08L5RZ8QJ,4,"
Small improvement but does feel better to hold, the camera is miles ahead of the X too. Upgraded due to iphone X age had decreased perfomance, maybe hold out for next release if you are with an iphone x still
"
9330,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Having upgraded from an iPhone7 I’m absolutely loving the 12.  Have got used to facial recognition & swiping very quickly.  As always, transferring phone info over was very quick & simple.  I’ve watched a couple of YouTube videos to understand the extra/different functionality which has really helped.  Battery life is definitely much better than my 7.  All in all I’m very happy with the 12.
"
9331,B08L5RZ8QJ,3,"
Well its an ihpone yes. We know they hooked us on and now we are tied to the ever more expensive models. We know that Apple earns a  ... load of money with them.But to deliver the phone without any head phones at all now is mean. Its only topped by the fact that it is delivered without an operational charger either. A new cable type which would not fit into any old charger.  So please spend how much extra?Its like selling a car without tyresIt is disgraceful,  it should be illegal.
"
9332,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
I fell in love with the phone. But, my service provider couldn't facilitate eSIM. And it's very difficult to change eSIM for any emergency needs or we travel to other places and wants to use new SIM.Apple should have provided Dual Nano SIM's. eSIM's will be difficult process for everyone to get and configure it. I'm sure not even 0.5% of iPhone users are adaptive to eSIM.

Another year, another new iPhone and this time it is really a different from all iPhones before not only because supports 5G or of the new square design, but everything it’s new inside and out and looks and feels promising. Delivery from Amazon top notch only took 2 days. The phone itself works great, connectivity is much better than previous models and battery life is just as before, screen is crisp and colours are great, camera performance is excellent for day and night photos, stereo speakers are definitely the best of all phones I ever used,  they simply deliver immersive sound that matches cinema experience. All in all Best iPhone to date. Negative: well the price is on the higher end but we all know that.

Apple just keep making it easier to upgrade between their phones! The whole setup was effortless and face recognition is working well.This is the first time I’ve had an iPhone with no home button, but it’s very self explanatory and easy to use.
"
9335,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Upgraded from an iPhone 7 Plus and its so so much better. Crystal clear screen. Better cameras front and back. Face recognition is fantastic, So far battery life is excellent only having to charge at night and even then its maybe down to 40% after using a lot during the day. Wireless charging makes life easy once you have the charge pads/stands. Thought id miss the home button but No its an excellent phone.

the last iphone i had was the iPhone 5SE.  I then decided to switch to android. I had two Android smartphones over the last few years, one midrange and one top range but i was increasingly feeling dissatisfied with the Android experience.i decided to upgrade to the latest iPhone and that decision has proved to be the right one.  i am very satisfied with the iPhone 12.  It is superb and thoroughly deserves to be called a smartphone.  I couldn't be more pleased with it.
"
9337,B08L5RZ8QJ,3,"
It is so pretty! the iphone 12’s design is so pretty in my personal opinion, it has amazing compatability with a lot of apps, the battery life seems good so far, i hope it stays like thatUpdate: Battery life has gone down so badly over the past year of having it, face ID has broken within 4-6 months of having the phone too 😐 Apple has gone downhill IMO, I've upgraded since
"
9338,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
had a old phone that was small so this one is much better because it has a bigger screen.i like apple phones so bought this one.
"
9339,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Everything good iPhones are a great bit of kit.
"
9340,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Is really comfortable when you hold it in your hand.in your pocket too. It has quite good camera. The battery is not that bad. I charge it once a day and is enough for me. I listen to a lot of music during the day.  This shows that it can handle daily tasks really easily.
"
9341,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Have been a Apple iPhone user for the last 10 years using a iPhone 6 which has never let me down, this upgrade to the 12 was a big step for me but after 3 weeks of using the new phone I am glad I purchased this phone it is fabulous and easy to use I would certainly recommend the iPhone 12.
"
9342,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Excellent, I bought this for my mom for mother's day and she is very happy with the product!
"
9343,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
It’s the first time to buy an Apple mobile phone on Amazon. I personally feel quite nervous, because I don’t know if it is really necessary to buy it on Amazon or go to the Apple store.  Start with the mobile phone, everything is normal, the quality is guaranteed and it is worth buying.
"
9344,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
I bought this for my wife to replace her 6S and she absolutely loves it.The camera is superb and so is the quality when watching videos on YouTube.It is a solid phone with superb features.The lack of a charger I feel is irrelevant as you can use your old chargers anyway and the battery life is a massive improvement.The lack of a headphone jack is also irrelevant to me as I bought an excellent adapter which works perfectly with wired headphones.
"
9345,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
I’d written off the idea of getting an iPhone after being disappointed with the iPhone 6 I had in the past but, after advice from family I ordered this and it’s perfect 👍
"
9346,B08L5RZ8QJ,3,"
The phone is great everything works fine just display is worse than on my iPhone 6s. A little yellowish. I was thinking to return it back but after I watched many videos on YouTube I decided to keep it as many people has similar problem. First time disappointed by Apple quality. Apple saying there’s nothing wrong with display it’s tuned by factory to yellowish tint and it’s still within specifications
"
9347,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
The only thing against this phone is my face's ability to either mute the sound or facetime someone mid-call.Apart from that battery life is excellent, face recognition is a real plus, and everything else works as well as you would expect an Apple product to.
"
9348,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
I’ve always been an android user however this year I decided to treat myself to this Apple iPhone and it has not disappointed me wish I made the switch sooner.
"
9349,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
My 8th iPhone and I couldn’t be happier. Got it at a good price. Purple is actually really nice. And it was £20 cheaper than the other colours.
"
9350,B08L5RZ8QJ,3,"
£750 overheats after playing cod for more than 30 mins, even with graphics set to low and frame rate set to medium. It may be graphically 40% faster but only when not playing games especially COD. Game plays better on a Samsung s8 which is 5 years old. Very very disappointed with playing games on this massively overpriced, over hyped iPhone.
"
9351,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Really substantial upgrade from my iPhone 8, which was already a fantastic piece of kit. Just miss the sleek, more compact profile of my old phone too... this one is chunky in comparison. Having said that, the battery life, camera and screen blow the iPhone 8 out of the water. It really is effortless to take great shots with these two cameras! The screen is just fantastic. Feels solid, which is good because it is going to be with me for a few years yet given how overpriced these things are.
"
9352,B08L5RZ8QJ,1,"
Bad experience getting this phone from amazon.  Call started to drop after a year. Amazon products support did not help keeping telling me the stuff which is common i.e restart the phin. Turn the aeroplane mode and then off etc. I have got the phone which doesn't work and have paid full price for it. Should have gone to Apple directly 🙄.
"
9353,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Bought this on Amazon. Great price compared with competitors. Great phone.

Excellent phone no problems easy to set up
"
9355,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Fantastic phone.  Went from iPhone 7 to this one and never looking back even though I loved my 7.  Would not have any other product than Apple simply the best.  So easy to use and everything just went from one phone to this other with no sweat or swearing!
"
9356,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
I’ve just upgraded from an iPhone 6 to this iPhone 12. Really pleased with it, very easy to use and very light. I am bias as I do prefer apple products to android.
"
9357,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Wonderful product and genuine without a doubt
"
9358,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
It arrived the next day. The phone is slightly smaller than my old iPhone 8 Plus but it fits better in my hand now. The resolution is visibly better, not quite used to the face recognition yet but I’m sure I will get the hang of it
"
9359,B08L5RZ8QJ,4,"
Coming from an old ‘window’ based phone, I found the iPhone great to use.. although not as intuitive to set up or find my way around.
"
9360,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Great phone. Snappy sharp and feels like good high-end quality. I really like it. It’s actually a perfect screen size for functionality in all senses for everyone. Not too big, and not too small, perfect for general use; browsing, Instagram, etc and brilliant OLED screen for Netflix with support for Dolby Vision. It is bright and responsive and fast in all conditions, including sunlight viewing. Do genuinely recommend, even though it’s a bit pricey.

 The appearance of the iphone 12 series has changed alot this time,the camera has also been enchanced a lot.The calculation and software have improved a lot, which is really great.especially the night shot taking is really good you can feel it on the screen,its tough level.If you are pursuing excellent camera functions and like Apple highly integrated ecological chain,then iphone 12 series is a very good choice and the choice will not make u regret it.Sending by my iphone12🥰🥰
"
9363,B08L5RZ8QJ,4,"
Overall the IPhone 12 is a great phone bug like most apple products, you pay more for the apple logo on the back than the technology itself.
"
9364,B08L5RZ8QJ,4,"
Used product to get 5G , before this phone I use to have I phone x not much differenceThanks
"
9365,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Very clear picture and comprises incredible features, very nice with long life battery.
"
9366,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
I am an Apple devotee, so, perhaps, slightly biased. As with all of the Apple products I have owned, superbly well made. Works and integrates with my other Apple products. Technology as it should be, in my view. One criticism, battery life could be better, but, I do get by with one charge per day.
"
9367,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Had it for two days now, used it constantly and only had to charge it once! I got in it purple and it’s really pretty, not too big which is nice and with a lot of nice features.
"
9368,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Bought this as soon as the iphone 13 was released because I knew the price would drop on the 12 and they would sell out quick. I was right.  Bought for a christmas present so haven't opened it.
"
9369,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
My last phone A Siemens M60 20+ yo on same battery served me well and is still working but buttons starting to stick This is a replacement and obviously things have moved on needed a push to upgrade (family) but got my own back by getting them to tutor me in its use
"
9370,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Easy to set up and well described
"
9371,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Easy to use.  This is my first iPhone in over ten years and it’s lovely to use.  Takes amazing pictures.  Face ID - wow.  It just works.  Amazing.  Love the colour.After using this for a few days I’m not really sure I’ll go back to android
"
9372,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
This is definitely the best iPhone I've owned and I've had them all since the iPhone 4 great build quality great battery life the screen looks amazing the stereo speakers are great too. The iPhone 12 doesn't come with charger or headphones which is a little disappointing but I use a wireless charger anyway so it didn't bother me . I usually go with product red but it looked a bit orange this year so got the blue version and I'm glad I did it looks stunning
"
9373,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Great everyday phone. One of the best iPhone I have had and used not to talk about the camera quality it’s absolutely great quality and battery life.
"
9374,B08L5RZ8QJ,4,"
Got this for my wife for Christmas and she's enjoyed using it so far.However as a Samsung Galaxy S fan, I must say that a 60fps screen is a bit strange for flagship tier phones in 2020/21.
"
9375,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Love this phone and all my information took juts few minutes to go over this new phone I was pretty relieved I had visions of losing my music and photos I bought the white and I love it
"
9376,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
I love the way the phone itself is very colourful and I love all of the features including the face recognition and the layout of the apps is great. I absolutely love the screen size and it is just the right size to fit in your pocket
"
9377,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Amazing
"
9378,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Amazing phone, great looking and easy to use. Camera is also top quality. My first iPhone, always been a android guy but this has been a breath of fresh air and a good change.
"
9379,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
The Iphone12 is the best of the Iphones so far but the price is expensive ! However buying a sim free phone is cheaper in the long run as your not tied in on any contract! I am very happy with this phone you can do so much with it !
"
9380,B08L5RZ8QJ,3,"
Frankly it was not much of an improvement on my IPhone 7, which my wife now has. The challenge of transferring data is far worse than the Apple solution suggests as it does not transfer music not bought from Apple. In addition, the developers seem to live in their own world which assumes that users are all geeks.
"
9381,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Brilliant iPhone with great features and so lightweight

My another iPhone ... I have to say it's below expectations battery so weak som app lag , yes nice design good photos but again display so dark in day light so so waste money hopefully my kid will won't for professional user wrong choice .
"

Good
"
9387,B08L5RZ8QJ,4,"
Not very good sound compared to Dolby on android but it is half the price of a top Samsung galaxy.Also could do with clearer display a bit of a let down but some apps are better and cheap for a 5 g mobile

cool!!!!
"
9389,B08L5RZ8QJ,1,"
Rip off. As has been said before, the lack of a charger is a total scam from Apple. Yes, Apple, you are reducing your carbon footprint and all that, but at the same time you are also making a tonne more revenue from accessory sales. If it was a genuine move, you'd supply a voucher code entitling buyers to order a charger for free. And the design to include a USB C cable? I mean what wall sockets have USB C? None. Who has a tonne of USB A power adaptors knocking around? Everyone. Simply including a cable that connects the phone to USB A would alleviate this issue, but no Apple in their wisdom assumes USB C is fine.I have  Macbook Pro which is generally fine and a phone could plug into that to charge, but I bought the phone for my teenage son. He'd never have an previous adaptor to use. I saw the light and switched to Samsung S series phones years ago. So his birthday present was almost useless out of the box - I wasn't even offered an upsell to get a charger at time of sale. I anticipate alot of moaning  in the coming days as he slowly starts to realise other short comings of this overpriced phone, but for me the no charger/USB C cable thing is a complete joke. AVOID!
"
9390,B08L5RZ8QJ,3,"
5G on and off, used usb leads to charge which made sound muted, phone keep going headphones mode despite no headphones were attached. Requires phone to restart. Did not find Apple standard except the price which was as high as for Apple products.
"
9391,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
The set up I had to do twice so make sure you update your old iPhone first. No instructions in box but lots of hints on phone. Took a while to work stuff out.
"
9392,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Everything about this phone is easy and very classy. It looks so very nice, easy to use, and a simple process transferring from one phone to another. I would recommend it to anyone.

 I bought this for my dad's birthday , the product description suggested its a ""New iPhone 12 128GB"", however it arrived in a brown Amazon box with bubble wraps inside. It didn't come with the official apple boxing and I have checked the serial number it was a refurbished iPhone.Won't recommend, this is not a brand new iPhone.
"
9395,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
I was impressed with the delivery service, the phone arrived within 24hrs. Xfer of data from my iphone 6 was easy. Good phone at reasonable price.
"
9396,B08L5RZ8QJ,1,"
I purchased this for 650 which is the same as apple store price for a new iPhone. This was advertised as new. However in the confirmation email it said old- like new. Battery life 98%. I immediately cancelled the delivery.
"
9397,B08L5RZ8QJ,3,"
Okay - lots of good stuff: great camera, great speakers, amazing screen etc.  But one huge flaw: one of the points of upgrading to 5G is that you should be able to ditch your wifi (provided you're in a 5G area).  But, you can't, and here's why: you cannot back up your phone using 5G.  This makes no sense, as 5G is often faster than wifi.  So, that means I can't cancel my wifi that's costing me £35 a month - just to back up my iPhone!
"
9398,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
It does what is written in the description.
"
9399,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
I love this phone , the photo quality and edits are amazing.
"
9400,B08L5RZ8QJ,2,"
I never write reviews on amazon, this is my first but I felt it was necessary as the iPhone 12 is an expensive product and I had high expectations for it. Undoubtedly Apple will launch and revision but for those of you who are thinking of buying this product, perhaps wait until everyone else who has ""tested"" this product for apple and exposed the bugs have helped refine the next version.Here are the issues I am experiencing:- Phone network reception just drops sporadically and does not restore itself, you need to restart the phone- Copy and paste does not work- The face recognition is not user friendly due to face masks or sunglasses, the thumb reader would be better under the circumstancesIf any of the above is a concern for you, consider something else.

I was hesitant at first with the price.I have always had Samsung mobiles but decided to buy Apple this time and what a excellent hand set this is.The operating system and performance it gives that’s why it’s one of the best iPhones on the market.
"
9409,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Easy to setup and so many more facilities available on this version to my previous phone. Good buy and price comparison matches any other companies.

9421,B08L5RZ8QJ,1,"
I decided to upgrade from iPhone XR recently to IPhone 12, as I was led to believe the iPhone 12 had battery life/efficiency.Normal use on my previous IPhone XR would take my battery life up to late evening from a full charge the previous night, which I was more than happy with.Same charge on this IPhone 12 from Amazon gets me to about lunchtime. Totally disappointed in this product to say the least.  I’ve lost all confidence in purchasing from Amazon.I was led to believe the iPhone 12 had a so much better battery efficiency which was the reason of my purchase/upgrade.I can only assume this ‘new’ phone is a refurbished phone that no one else wanted and /or returned.I’m actually trying to finish this review before the battery runs out.  I kid you not.If I could give this review zero stars I would.Note to self==========Always go straight to Apple for Apple products, especially with the costs involved.  Never going to Amazon again for Apple products.

Let me repeat, it didn't last 1, single, solitary week.Not 1.It didn't last 3 days.It lasted... 2... kinda.Galway through the second it started turning off with no warning.No problem, I'll just send it back... nah... Amazon don't like that. It's been over a month. I've talked to Amazon support more times in that period than I'd like to admit, more than I have to my grandparents. And they refuse to issue a refund. So, I have paid eight hundred pounds for the oh so enviable opportunity to peruse the Amazon support pages and struggle with their support team.The phone is probably fine but, and I can't stress this enough:DO NOT BUY THIS FROM AMAZON!Buy it from someone who accepts in person returns, like Apple or Curry's.AVOID AMAZON'S CUSTOMER SUPPORT AT ALL (and I do mean ALL) COSTS!
"

Replaced my iPhone 8 plus with this iPhone 12 Red. Lovely bit of kit!
"
9463,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Social media manager here, upgrade from iPhone Xr, not much a change except camera which is worth it for me. But it isn’t your job to take photos on your phone, but iPhone 11.
"
9464,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
I had a iPhone X and upgraded to the iPhone 12I am a little disappointed that it has a few better upgrades from the iPhone XBut I think the technology on upgrades are very little
"
9465,B08L5RZ8QJ,4,"
Battery life is rather disappointing after having had the XR which was excellent!
"
9466,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Got this to replace my iPhone 7.  Like the way it was easy to transfer my data from iPhone to iPhone.  Love the bigger screen and have found it simple to use.

"
9471,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Upgraded from an iPhone 7 to the 12, so glad I did. The difference is like night and day.  If you’re looking to upgrade from an older iPhone, go for it.
"
9472,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
I like this minty phone. I liked my dead iPhone 7. The face recognition is surprisingly good. I tried lots of different grimaces and it’s not fooled. Far far too expensive but otherwise a minty treat.

Bought this phone from Amazon on Prime Day - from a market place 3rd party seller sold 'via Amazon' and sadly discovered the phone had a 3rd party camera added to the phone and then sold as brand new.How do we know? - Apple confirmed that the serial number of the camera was not a genuine Apple camera serial number when they ran diagnostics and so this phone camera will never work and this iPhone was corrupted despite being sold as brand new boxed and wrapped. I will never buy an Apple phone or high-value phone from Amazon but only from the direct Apple shop - in the future. I would advise anyone to proceed with caution after my experience.Amazon has refunded me the cost of this phone.  Amazon is as always, excellent for their customer service so 5* for Amazon!  I am sorry that Amazon has such tricky sellers using their platform. It damages their reputation.

The phone developed a hardware fault within 30 days,contacted Amazon and was asked to return the phone for repair,almost 3 weeks later it was returned to me still in the same condition,took it to Apple which I should have done in the first place and it was repaired within the hourHave to say Amazon’s handling of this has been appalling I won’t be purchasing any more Apple products anytime soon
"
9580,B08L5RZ8QJ,1,"
After less than 3 months the screen suddenly died. It’s now unusable and I’m told I need to spend £280 to get it fixed. Apparently the screen isn’t covered by the warranty. Absolutely disgusting, I’ll never buy another Apple product again. Not fit for purpose

We upgrade our phones so you can expect better speed, better camera and better network, however, believe me, there is no difference whatsoever from iPhone 11 to 12, I have the disconnection issue since day one and its just worse than the iPhone 11I have found no speed difference with this upgrade and I have found that 11 camera is even better than 12 !!!  what is going on with Apple, they are just giving us the same old things in a new package !

Brand new phone, neary £700, it hardly holds a charge and takes 20 minutes to charge 5%.Apple checked the phone and said they would have provided a refund if I'd purchased with them, but as it's over 30 days old and I bought via Amazon, I'm offered the option of a 'repair'.Brand new phone, hardly used, needs to be repaired.I will never, ever buy an Apple product via Amazon again.

I recently purchased iphone 12 128 GB from amazon. I was excited to have this phone as it looks amazing and feels awesome in hand. However, Its battery doesn't lasted more than 4 hours of screen time. I am not sure if its just with me. I return this item to amazon and after 12 Days of returning this item finally I got my refund.I am disappointed with Iphone12 battery and amazon return service.
"
9598,B08L5RZ8QJ,1,"
Unfortunately, the box came opened, and there were signs of it having been used.  Returned easily though.
"
9599,B08L5RZ8QJ,1,"
ok
"
9600,B08L5RZ8QJ,1,"
The volume down button stopped working after two months. The whole phone crashed after 4 months. Never ever buying a phone from Amazon again. I want my money back, what's the warranty policy?
"
9601,B08L5RZ8QJ,2,"
Mixing colourTurning on and off from time to timeIt was a waste of timeI returned product
"
9602,B08L5RZ8QJ,1,"
Bought this expensive phone, kept freezing. Within 1 month it failed completely and it seems you don’t get a refund but a repair which can take 2 weeks. Had to buy another phone and now have no confidence in the iPhone 12 and would rather have had a refund.
"
9603,B08L5RZ8QJ,2,"
I thought I would upgrade from my XS Max to the iPhone 12. But I found out I had actually downgraded. I wouldn't go this route again.
"
9604,B08L5RZ8QJ,1,"
The problem is Amazon delivery .. they say next day delivery but in fact you will never know. Their drivers play hide & seek .. very unreliable. My advise buy from a decent outlet .. not Amazon.
"
9605,B08L5RZ8QJ,1,"
Phone arrived quickly.  After a few days the phone shut down and would not power back up.  Tried restart procedure but nothing so requested a return.  Item was returned with proof of postage on 28th June and still awaiting a refund.
"
9606,B08L5RZ8QJ,1,"
I bought it 2-3 months ago but now the battery life decreased from 100% to 99%.
"
9607,B08L5RZ8QJ,1,"
The signal drops out constantly when I’m trying to make calls and the internet looses its signal too. Keep needed to restart the phone which for the amount payed it is laughable.
"
9608,B08L5RZ8QJ,1,"
The screen quality and battery life is not as good as the XR. Also, so many qliches and freezing that the xR never had.I’d go for the xR or 11 for a cheaper price and not an oled screen.
"
9609,B08L5RZ8QJ,1,"
I was highly surprised that Amazon would hide information about warranty on the listing page for iPhones bought from Amazon Warehouse.Also, an iPhone which is in ""Very Good"" condition could be a renewed one!!!
"
9610,B08L5RZ8QJ,1,"
Do not buy, it’s not a new phone 12, arrived with the iPhone packaging removed, asked Amazon to sort it our told I have to wait three weeks don’t waste your money
"
9611,B08L5RZ8QJ,1,"
Phone arrived cracked and chipped. Took ages to sort out with amazon. Not worth the hassle. Should have bought from somewhere with a better reputation.
"
9612,B08L5RZ8QJ,1,"
This is second attempt to review my experience as very poor . Amazon control what they want you to read . Phone packed up 1 month from new .

9621,B08L5RZ8QJ,4,"
The seller does not indicate the region of manufacture. The one i ordered was manufactured in Canada, which is why I can't loyalty cards to Apple Pay in the UK. My credit card works fine, so I have no complaints.
"
9622,B08L5RZ8QJ,1,"
Phone quality is no better than Cheaper brands. Waste of money
"
9623,B08L5RZ8QJ,1,"
It’s a great phone but it packed in working after 16 months - 4 months out of warranty. Apple want £465 to fix it even though they haven’t opened it to see what’s wrong. I’m hoping Amazon replace it under their 2 year warranty or I’ll have to invoke my consumer protection rights. £750 is a lot of money for something that stopped working after less than 2 years. Cosmetically it’s 100%. Not dropped or wet.Just waiting for Amazon to get back to my son, who bought me it as a special present.Gutted!

This phone i have only had a day and i have seen vast improvements to the older version of this phone and arguably the building blocks for this phone the iPhone 11. I bought the iPhone 11 and it was the replacement to my old iPhone XR. after having this phone for the short while i have the phone i have seen many aspects which make the upgrade worth it. This iPhone for starters has 5G and the phone also has a better chip. This Iphone has a new technology called super retina XDR display and this display is much better than the ones on the XR and 11 as they didn't even have the same pixel density as the iPhone 6! the other improvement is the the curved edges and this may sound like a weird point. However the phone is better looking and is more grippy to your hand, it also makes the phone feel newer as the older phones had slight curves in the screen which now look outdated. The sound quality is about the same as the 11 with stereo speakers. The next thing to point out is the bold colour choices, you can get plain white or black but there is also a purple, blue, green and red edition as well. I picked the blue colour and it is like a deep impact blue to the like of the blue you see many fords painted in the UK. The red is a slight salmon colour and you will think the phone is quite coral. the green is nice and looks minty. However the purple is a candy floss like colour and is a bold choice. However i don't think you will regret buying the purple one!. The last point of my review is the storage option and the base amount is 64GB and this is not enough if you have a lot of music and photos and apps then you will want the 128GB version at an extra £50 to the base model. if you are a hardcore Iphone user and feel as if you need 256GB of storage then my advice would be not to buy the basic 12 and get the Pro or pro max and get the upgraded storage option. Yes you will pay a bit more however you will not regret it as the pro and the pro max add a ton more features and have the more classy stainless steel bands and have 3 cameras. So thats my advice hope it helps!

I've always had cheaper Android phones, never wanted to spend Apple money. Not against the brand, but I don't like having expensive kit in my pocket. (I've had an old apple Ipad for years, so I'm not scared of Apple). Anyway, more recently I upgraded from a Huawei p20 lite - a £200 phone) to an Iphone 11, mainly driven by the better camera and thought It’s about time I treated myself to something a little more expensive, as I've never broken or lost a phone in my pocket.2 Weeks in and I'm still getting frustrated, I just can’t do the things I would expect from a phone!My main gripes are:*I have 25 Gb of photos on my Android, I just want to move them over. I don’t want my photos on the cloud, I have enough backups. I just want them physically on the iPhone. it seems the latest ios has blocked direct transfer from Windows (I can see the file, just cant paste to it). All other routes are extremely painful. Just let me drag and drop please!!!*Same goes in reverse – considering the main reason I bought the phone was for the camera. I own my photos, why can’t I just easily take them off my phone. I don’t want them in the cloud, I don’t want them hidden when I delete them. I want direct access to my own files please.*This was my first IPhone, so I was expecting the transition to be nice. Open the box and no USB adapter??? There is a USB C lead, but who has a USB C charger? All my wall plates around the house are USB A. My car is USB A. My PC is USB A. great, so I need to spend another £20 to use my phone, and another £20 updating all my leads in my car, at work etc.*To the above point, why isn’t this just a USB C standard?*If transferring photos is difficult, everything else seems impossible. Absolutely no visibility of folder structure in windows.*The phone is bulkier and a lot heavier than my P30 lite, and so far I haven't seen anything to benefit the extra mass or bulk.I really wanted to love this phone, but so far all I want to do is just return it and go back to my old phone which is 1/3 of the price.

Finally upgraded from iPhone 6s. Loving the speed, the screen, the camera’s Bokeh feature. Great phone. Bought it from John Lewis. To my disappointment they further reduced the price 2 days later. BUT I discovered they actually price match themselves and they gave me a refund of the difference - no quibbles. Excellent!

Love this new phone. Not had an apple iPhone before. It’s easy to use still learning about it but delighted with it so far.

My first iPhone since the iPhone 6, so far I am very happy with it. Coming from android I was happy with the The user layout. It is very intuitive and easy to navigate the build quality of the phone is very sturdy and light but so light it’s at risk of feeling “cheap”. This is really nitpicking. The phone’s snappy response means all tasks I throw at it are carried out smoothly and effortlessly.Bad points: no charger is a pain in the backside! Not having a usb c powerbrick to hand meant I had to revert to an old iPad charger I luckily had. Why they went for a lightning port to usb C I will never know as it is the most pointless and least available connection. (At least to me) I have now swapped back to a lightning to usb 2.0 and normality is restored (yes the charging is not as fast anymore) overall a good purchase in my opinion but I might not be able to say the same If I was coming from an iPhone 11 or similar.Overall, a good phone to consider if you are due an upgrade or like me have an older phone dying a horrid death! I’m sure there’s others out there who will say Android is better and to be quite honest I believe both have their flaws and benefits.
"
9631,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Ignore the reviews from people who haven’t bought one, that’s laughable. Yes the phone doesn’t come with headphones or a power plug but it’s hard to believe you would really need another power plug if you’re in the market for this phone. Just wasted plastic at this point. Having said that I did upgrade to a usb-c power plug and it charges from dead to full in 1hr 30 and fast charges to 50% in 30 minutes, the battery also holds charge a lot longer than a phone you’re likely to be upgrading from like an old 7, 8, X. The most impressive feature is the camera with night mode and wide angle. The Oled screen is also stunning especially if you turn the lights off and watch a Dolby vision video. This will be the phone that people own for 5+ years without needing an upgrade. When you think the iPhone X was released at £1000, this is a much more refined product and coming in £200 cheaper.
"
9632,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
Absolutely love this phone and have no issues with the product itself. Word of warning though: if you don't own an Apple computer, you will need to purchase additional accessories separately. The lightning cable included in the box has a USB-C connector which can't be plugged into a standard Windows PC or plug from an older iPhone model.

Upgrading from the XR you see the difference between  4g and 5G. Overall the design on the apps and UI (user interface ) feels nicer to the eye and more snappy the oled screen is great for dark gritty films. Despite its price and apples ups and downs with privacy and god knows what else the phone delivers on many fronts however the worst part of the product lies with the battery. I hope one day I could make my battery last a week without a charge, I don’t use it too much and it lasts roughly 3 days but while at work I have to charge it every morning
"
9646,B08L5RZ8QJ,5,"
I had struggled along for a while with my old 6s. Big mistake. Bought the twelve after reading all the reviews of 11-13.  Very easy to set up from cloud. Love the magnetic cordless charging. Battery life seems endless compared to old phone. I do lots of calls,emails and SMS/WhatsApp messages and calls. Don't use camera that much. Great phone.

Just upgraded from X, just another brilliant phone by Apple, great design, fast and super light. I love the colour (blue) unique. It’s a pity that there is no adapter included but I have so many brand new chargers in their wraps from my past iPhones that I never used, so no problem at all.

Didn’t like the price but who does lol. Love the phone, great functionality, good size to see/hold and crystal clear screen etcMost people who buy these have already looked up the spec so I won’t go into that side, but I do know you will enjoy using this beautiful phone and all it’s features.There are some cheaper very good phones out there, but I like the reliability of Apple phones and they are always in good enough working condition to pass down to grandchildren when you upgrade

It was time to retire my 6s after many years of loyal service.I kept waiting for Apple to bring the fingerprint back but as it wasn’t happening got this one.Great phone otherwise but the face recognition doesn’t work half the time. It’s a problem in the shops, in the dark, when wearing a hat and sunglasses and sometimes just for no reason at all. Please bring back the fingerprint!Why Apple and not Samsung or any other phone brand? Cause of security! And because they stand up to Facebook and other companies that want your private data to sell you more stuff and make money off of you! Google for example should give their phones to people for free seeing how much they “spy” on their users.

I am an iPhone user and I’ve had iPhones since the 3G version many, many years ago.This is my 1st with an OLED screen. For me personally, iPhones have gotten a bit chunky over the last few years and have gotten thicker each year since the 6 and 6S.The iPhone 12 is only 7.4mm thick with a super glossy 6.1“ screen which reminds me of the iPhone 4 with its straight aluminium sides and for me it’s perfect.I have small hands and this is probably a little bit big for me to use comfortably but I think that 6.1” is the perfect size screen for trolling the net and using Safari so I’ll put up with having to use 2 hands every now and then.The battery is comparable to the XR I had previously and the blue colour matches my Apple Watch 6 perfectly.I bought the 128gb version to help with resale prices next year but 64GB for me would have been enough as I still have 102gb free after 2 months use. (As a guide I have 79 songs, 3 videos and 169 photos, I’m certainly not a heavy user! )If you are reading this and are thinking of buying one, the iPhone 13 will be out in a few months and it’s expected to have a slightly faster processor and a different camera arrangement and new colours. It may be the 12S, it may be the 13, but in my opinion you can always miss a year out.This phone is well made, takes great photos and has a sublime screen with iMessage as well as 5G (which I’ve tried using O2) and the benefit of the best App Store in the world. Buy it and enjoy the Apple experience.

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 I have an iphone 11 and am very happy with it, I purchased an iphone 12 for my wife as a Birthday present and have been comparing the 2 phones, I really like feel of the iphone 11 which is an aluminium frame the iphone 12 does not have the same premium feel, it is a lot lighter in the hand, the 11 has rounded edges whereas the 12 has flat.Speed wise using you cannot tell a difference, we are both using 4G, when my wife changes her contract and opts for one with 5G her smartphone will be a lot faster.Both smartphones outperform the cheaper brands when receiving text messages, and Whatsapp and also email messages.

With modern technology you can do so much. This phone even though it's not the latest one has all the tech stuff you need. I'm not going to explain everything it can do but what's described in the description part is what it can do. A good phone.

I don’t  know what's going on with my iphone. Some apps stop working normally for a few minutes and today, out of nowhere it was running half a screen for a few seconds and restarted alone. However, I want a new device and not have it repaired because I bought it on March 24th. I await answers and that my problem is solved. Thanks.

A fantastic product to use. Data transfer was a breeze. Battery life is excellent. A couple of minor glitches in software which I am sure will be fixed in future releases e.g. during a WhatsApp video call if you toggle between screens then video keeps dimming after every few seconds.

Great phone, amazing screen and just easy to use. Best feature of iPhones is the software and all the integrations with Apple products. I personally would have liked a bigger battery as it goes down relatively fast when using 5g during the day. But overall I must admit that for the average user (me) iPhone never lets you down.

There are plenty of reviews for iPhone 12's out there so I'll stick to the Amazon experience. The price undercuts purchasing direct. One day later I got a SIM-free iPhone 12 in the branded box ready to stick my own SIM straight in. Worked like a dream and I spent less than buying direct - especially as I was happy to get the blue as it was a bit cheaper for some reason (but who cares when it spends all its life in a case!).

Apple prices are always high in comparison with other iPhones, and Apple is mean with supplying essential accessories, like charging connectors. However, this is made up ( I think ), by quality, design and after sales service as well as providing at east 5 years of critical updates.

The phone all around was in great condition and was totally worth the purchase! However if you are a *perfectionist* or whatever, they do come with little imperfections like mine came with little scratches on the corner and sides however with a car on there is no visible damage at all! The battery life is good about a whole day of battery if not used Al day. The only little thing that I can say is bad about my renewed phone is that when I try to play voice messages to my ear it turns the screen black and I have no idea why but it’s barely a big fault! If anyone is wondering whether to get one just ask yourself if your willing to save £200+ for some minor scratches?
"
9701,B08PCCM1GC,4,"
Product arrived in a simple wrap around die cut package, so I was extra careful to inspect for any transit damage, I need not have been concerned the very basic package did its job.First impression was very favourable as I could find no marks, issues, or signs of wear until upon very close inspection I found a tiny small scratch on the top right had side of the screen. The scratch is less than 2 mm in length, does not appear to be 'deep' can only be seen when the screen is off, when on it cannot be seen at all.The battery capacity is showing 90%. However, I have a concern over VFM, I felt at the time it was overpriced. And now seeing that Amazon have reduced the price by a considerable amount after less than ten days, I am even more convinced over VFM, heart over head methinks!My overall 'score' reflects the price paid. However, I am satisfied with the device, it looks new, seems to be 'fit for purpose' and is far superior to my last mobile.I am most certainly looking forward to many years of trouble free usage.

9702,B08PCCM1GC,5,"
I'm actually really impressed. We paid £453 for an iPhone 12 pro. It came in a standard non branded box, with charger, SIM tool and warranty card. The phone was wrapped in bubble wrap and honestly, looks new. There was some very very minor marks on the sides but literally, they were covered as soon as you picked up by fingerprints, so you wouldn't notice. Everything functions perfectly, face recognition works great. Battery life was 87 percent, which for a 2 year old phone I thought was amazing. I'm so glad we gambled and saved ourselves a couple of hundred pounds. We borrowed an actual box from a friend and gave it to our daughter as a Christmas present, she is in love with it and hasn't asked if it's second hand so clearly hasn't noticed! Amazing, amazing.There was only one downside and that was from Amazon themselves and not the seller. They'd left the package outside in the rain, so it could've easily been stollen or soaked through which would've been a nightmare!

9703,B08PCCM1GC,4,"
I bought an Iphone 12 pro 128gb 2 weeks ago in 'excellent' condition for £499. I was doubtful It would arrive in the flawless condition they claim but I took a risk. Anyway when it arrived I noticed all 4 corner metal edges of the phone were very slightly damaged (noticeable it had been dropped by the previous owner) but with a basic case on the phone looked brand new. The screen, camera and back of the phone were actually flawless. The battery arrived with 85% life which feels so much longer lasting than the 86% battery life of my XR prior so cant complain. I saved close to £400 and this will be the way I will be buying my future phones DEFO worth the money.

9704,B08PCCM1GC,5,"
Placed the order for my iPhone 12 Pro in ""Acceptable condition (refurbished)"" on Friday 6th January and received the item the following day. The phone was as descrcibed, only having minor scratches on the screen. The camera lens and the rear of the phone were in good condition with no visible scratches. Lastly, the battery was displaying 88% capacity so all-in-all i am very happy with my purchase. Would definitely recommend!

9706,B08PCCM1GC,5,"
I was sceptical at first, obviously, it was so cheap for something like new. When it came in it’s packaging, I was worried because it looked trash, but once I got it out, started setting it all up… I’m completely convinced I’ve struck gold. Not to be dramatic but I will be buying all my devices here, delivery was also way quicker than it was estimated! I ordered on the 9th, got it on the 12th, and their warranty is true to its word, I had a false alarm and they were completely down to fix it but all it needed was a force restart, lol 👍🏽
"
9707,B08PCCM1GC,5,"
The phone is absolutely in perfect condition! No scratches at all. It seems new. The only thing is the battery which as 84% of capacity is not lasting very much but for the price I’ve got it it’s really worth it!

There is no way of knowing what you’ll get, be warned!!!Unfortunately I had to return the phone and in doing so, PAID FOR RETURN P&PI returned it because the phone only had 92% batt health when I received it and it went down 1% within 2 days of using itTo me, this was catastrophicI used it for a week but I just couldn’t get over the low batt healthFor £615 I was expecting basically unusedI also did some research (after buying this, doh) and found out that iOS 14 KILLED the 12 Pro battery when it was released and I suspect that the phone I received suffered badly because of thisIn terms of condition- the phone was 99% mint, just 3-4 dot-sized nicks out of the chrome edging but no dents or scratches whatsoeverAmazon and MusicMagpie combined were perfect where the return was concerned but I was pretty narked to pay return p&p

For a great many years I have managed to avoid buying an iPhone for myself.Finally, I took the plunge buying refurbished to try it out and save some money whilst also helping the environment. I do not regret my purchase whatsoever and have been a happy bunny. However, the only single down side is the battery life is not what was expected but I’m still charging it once per day as usual anyway, so I can live with that.
"
9732,B08PCCM1GC,4,"
I like my iphone 12 pro but the battery life is not really good what I expected 😕
"
9733,B08PCCM1GC,4,"
I bought this to replace my iPhone XS. As the battery was bad and needed to improve the tech.  But this arrived with only 83% battery health. So I sent it back. It clearly stated it would be much more than this too.  So not great.
"
9734,B08PCCM1GC,5,"
Phone was smashed and not functional, the battery seemed to explode and expects me to return the phone even though it’s a hazard and that making the proccess even longer
"
9735,B08PCCM1GC,5,"
It came in superb condition. The battery had great health, and everything else works spot on. I am very pleased with my purchase I would buy from the seller again. This is a great phone for all age groups. The camera is my favourite feature
"
9736,B08PCCM1GC,4,"
The phone came in with 92% battery life and no visible marks which is a good sign and one that really matters. However the packaging was absolutely horrible, and I want to stress that it looked as if packaging was done for wood stick. In addition the charger provided with the phone is a really low quality one.

So after my first attempt to get a refurbished phone, where the phone was in an excellent condition.  I had to return that one and try again.  So I ordered exactly the same phone again, only to find that the phone wasn't in 'Excellent' condition as described on the website.  There were so many scratches around the edges of the phone, although the screen appeared to be in excellent condition, I would have put this in 'Good' or possibly 'OK' condition.  So after my first experience where the SIM card didn't register, I checked that first and it was fine.  So just to be safe I did some more checks the mag charger worked, but the cable charger didn't work.  What does this company actually check before it sends the phone out?  These are basic checks and to say 'Excellent' condition is a joke.  So now after returning 2 iphones I'm still waiting for a refund of £1008.45 for both phones.  Not a great experience.

Not satisfied, With ...Good Condition ! Had a lot of scratches on the glass of the screen and one greater on the side , alu frame of the screen. Not satisfied !
"
9739,B08PCCM1GC,2,"
I purchased an “excellent condition iPhone 12 pro” but the phones battery health on the phone is only 80% which means the phone has been used a lot beforehand. Doesn’t seem excellent to me.

9740,B08PCCM1GC,1,"
I purchased this iPhone for my daughters 18th birthday, so it was important for me  to have a phone that looked new. I read the description of a phone rated “excellent condition” and it says screen - no scratches, body - no scratches or dents. Please look at the photos of what I received!! There is a crack in the corner and the screen was covered in scratches, the previous owner clearly hadn’t used a screen protector as my very old iphone 6’s screen is in much better condition. Amazon also had to help me out as the seller doesn’t pay for returns so I have had to pay for the return myself and send a photo of my receipt to Amazon who will refund postage for me. The refund for the phone will take 5-7 days so it means I won’t have my refund quick enough to source another one in time for my daughters birthday. It’s been a bit of a nightmare! The seller needs to be honest with their description as it causes a lot of disappointment and hassle otherwise.
"
9741,B08PCCM1GC,5,"
Arrive late but through no fault of the seller ( Royal Mail strike )  the iPhone is in excellent condition as described by seller no problem at all
"
9742,B08PCCM1GC,4,"
The phone is in very good condition, has no scratches or chips at all.I was worried due to some of the other reviews.The battery health is at 86% which is fine for a phone that has potentially been used for a year or so already.

9743,B08PCCM1GC,1,"
Still appalling value for money, even second hand, they cost mere pounds to make in volume. Price does not reflect intrinsic value, rather what consumers are prepared to pay, and these days they are prepared to pay what Apple tell them to pay. Economics of capitalism. Go research.Cameras are below market average, whatever the reassuring advertising says, it's just words. All the grand images and videos Apple show in their hype ads are created through software rendering. You can get results like these, and better, from any image source using any editing software, even the free ones. Won't be using these for my professional photographic needs, got a 108 megapixel snapper on another brand for that, the difference really does show.Pleased with handset, perfect except for one small mark on bezel. Battery appears okay, but then the phone is only a year old. Some older models I've recently bought (7 and 8 series) needed replacements (easy to do yourself).Will be used as an iPod, not a phone, iTunes is only music player that plays back mix albums without those tiny gaps between tracks, one thing Apple have always got right. On downside, playlists can occasionally cause problems, some won't switch off and can only be deleted via PC, others cause track title/band display errors, especially with mp3s not bought through Apple, but this is a minor niggle, gaplesss playback is why I bought this, that's probably Apple's crowning achievement. When you've gone Android for your phone needs, you don't go back.Had to buy the 256 GB model, not the 128, because iOS generates a permanent massive ""cache"" file in use, up to 10gb, which means this chunk of memory storage can't be used for user files, it's a niggle that's been on iPhones since early days and Apple haven't rectified it, probably think they don't need to, blame it on their customers as usual. It used to be part of the ""system files"" when you check storage use in general settings, now it has its own entry, so at least now you can check how much of your phone's memory storage is unavailable. It's a huge chunk.Lastly, don't buy from Loop Mobile, they aren't nice people to deal with and won't accept you cancelling an order one even if it is only an hour after placing

I was initially unsure about buying a ‘renewed’ iPhone 12 from Amazon and the vendor, Phones Direct uk only had a few ratings but all 100% positive. I went for it and couldn’t be happier (and relived) when it arrived. Quick delivery, well packaged and the phone looked brand new other than not having the protective film on the screen. As it was a ‘renewed’ product I probably spent extra time trying my hardest to find imperfections, tiny scratches etc but couldn’t find a thing, perfect condition. Not sure the plug and charging cable are original but they work as well as my existing apple cable and plug. The quick start guide included is a Phones Direct uk guide rather than an apple one but it was all I needed (the phone does it all for you). Been using the phone for a while and all working as expected. It comes with a 12 month Amazon renewed warranty so still have the same piece of mind as a new phone. Based on my experience, I would buy a renewed product from Phones Direct Uk again.

The phone is great condition. Some scratch on the side. The screen is good though, everything works in perfect

9753,B08PCCM1GC,5,"
Ordered this phone because I tried repairing my phone myself, and it went horribly wrong.. so came onto Amazon and came across this product. I was a bit reluctant because I’ve never ordered a renewed phone, but there was no difference compared to a brand new iphone! No scratches, no damages, and a lot cheaper than ordering a brand new one. Everything works great! It even came with a charger and a plug whereas a brand new iPhone 12 Pro doesn’t come with a plug. Would highly recommend this!

Originally bought this as a mistake instead of Pro Max, immediately contacted seller after buying it but they didn’t respond and sent the item anyway. I decided to keep it as I needed a phone ASAP. 2 weeks in and the battery only lasts a few hours, and now the Face ID isn’t working properly. Seller still won’t respond.

Iphone 12 Pro came in excellent condition, no scratches, battery is at 89% health. I have no complaints and would definitely buy again from this seller. Delivery made as promised, not in original package, but safe and secure nonetheless. Came with brand new USB to Lightning cable.
"
9762,B08PCCM1GC,3,"
Battery 89,acceptable.But there are scratches which cannot be ignored on the screen and the back,contacted the seller several times and didn’t get the reply.It’s worth the price but it looks absolutely not new.Whatever,it will have the scratches in several weeks after all,and the price was low.这价格还要啥自行车 哈哈哈哈哈
"
9763,B08PCCM1GC,5,"
I was worried about buying a refurbished phone  but took the gamble. It came in two days signed delivery in a non descript white box. The phone was in a sealable bag, with a charging cable (no headphones or plug). The phone was immaculate in every way. The battery life was 89% but must be expected considering the discount in price.I’ve had my IPhone 12 Pro over a month now with no issues or problems. Highly recommend.

iPhone like new in great condition not a scratch or mark on screen or body. Works perfectly had no problems in setting it up and importing settings from my old iPhone 7. Was a bit worried about face recognition but easy to set up and no probs in use. Camera takes good clear pics. Battery life is good fantastic in comparison to old phone. To sum up very pleased with my purchase.
"
9766,B08PCCM1GC,5,"
So I was really reluctant spending a lot of money on a second hand phone, but safe to say I’m very relieved and actually really happy. I’d say if 100% was a brand new phone, I would say 95%. The tiniest of mark on the screen and that’s it. Which I expected more than that with it being second hand!! And battery health is 94%. Again, what I’d expect with it being second hand. So overall, very pleased and luckily for me worth the risk.
"
9767,B08PCCM1GC,5,"
Scratch free, excellent battery, and half the price. For a year old phone!
"
9768,B08PCCM1GC,5,"
The phone arrived in a foam padded box, with sim tool and charger. The battery health is 100% out of the box and is in pristine condition. There are no surface imperfections whatsoever.The phone functions as if new including facial recognition and cameras.Great value for money. Would recommend.

I was hoping that all the bad review of loop mobile were just some angry client, instead I’ve to say that they were absolutely true LOOP MOBILE let me down big times I bought this iPhone 12 Pro that should have been renewed, when instead The description of the product is completely false, was stating that should be an item that is renewed, when instead the item is just used, not even cleaned, it came with the lcd all scratched, not any kind of protection on top, I wasn’t expecting a protection glass on top but at the very least a kind of film on top of the lcd, the phone was all dirty, and the scratches visible from more than not just 30cm you can see them with your eyes closed, customer service very poor, I had to go through amazon customer service to have any kind of help, and even there just a refund, I needed the phone not something that I’ve to send back and revive the money after another week, absolutely unhappy, be careful to do not order fromLoop mobile if you getting a renewed phone, but get it from the other seller, that instead has very very good reviews, do not make my same error guys…!

As with a lot of people I was a bit unsure about buying a refurbished phone, especially when you don't know how it's going to arrive, however I have to say I'm nothing but impressed!No noticeable cosmetic damage, battery health at 99%, it may as well have come factory fresh at this point! Would definitely recommend, especially given the price.

You wouldn’t know that this phone is used at all. There’s not a single scratch on it, works really well. The only way I know this is used is that the battery health is 94% - but I’m still really happy and would definitely buy a refurbished phone again.
"
9787,B08PCCM1GC,5,"
Great value for money. Reconditioned phone arrived ahead of time. Phone looks perfect. Transfer from old iPhone was extremely easy.  I saved a lot of money as against buying a brand new 13 & this does everything for me. Great service from this seller.

The worst seller I have dealt with when it comes to warranty and repairs. I have brought a phone which has 1 year warranty. This seller messed me about so much and never fixed it. I sent it to them 2 times at my own cost. They’re a waste of time and the communication is so poor. It’s like talking to a brick wall and it’ll get you nowhere. Never again will I use them. Avoid at all costs.

The phone provide by Loop-Mobile, I have received is at best described as fair/good standard. It works fine but the cosmetics are damaged on the upper areas of the metal body all around the phone. The phone also arrived dirty, especially around speaker at the bottom of the phone and around volume controls and the camera lens. All easily cleanable but you’d expect the phone to arrive clean if been through their quality control as described. I have requested a refund. I would add that you should check which company you are ordering from as they don’t all come from same one and I’m sure others will be fine.

The only flaw is that the battery (although I knew that refurbished ones don't have 100% working battery) sometimes gets discharged earlier and earlier.

IPhone arrived without any marks or scuffs. You can't find any fault with the usability. Battery is 100%. Face id works like a charm. I highly recommend this seller to anyone looking to buy. Delivered in 2 days. Overall I'm completely impressed!
"
9850,B08PCCM1GC,5,"
The phone is in mint condition, no issues whatsoever, not even a tiny scratch. I have got the gold one, 128GB for a very good price and it was delivered in a couple of days The box is not Apple original, nor is the charger, but its no big deal considering is not brand new. Would definitely recommend this buy.

For a refurb phone. It’s great. Battery life is at 97%. I was expecting at least 84% so very happy with this. 👍🏾
"
9855,B08PCCM1GC,4,"
The phone was in perfect condition it’s just the battery health was too low for my liking Was at 83% messaged the seller and he was happy to give me a refund once I’ve returned everything back which was great. Received the refund within few days after returning

I was more concern over ordering renewed product wether it will be an original or will have no warranty, because of Amazon backed 1 year warranty I chose to go ahead. I received a phone in prestine condition (just as new), no wear and tear no scratches just as new. No one can differentiate wether it's a new or renewed. I got 10 months apple warranty remaining on the product. I got mobile in custom box not the apple branded. In the box I got mobile phone, charging cable, No charger included.I am using the phone and have faced no issues at all.
"
9858,B08PCCM1GC,5,"
To be honest, I was a little sceptical about purchasing a phone that appeared to be around 1/3 it's retail price. I've heard the horror stories about people opening their non-Apple certified gadgets and witnessing them crash and burn before their own eyes.The reviews where largely hit or miss, seemed like almost a gamble. You could either end up with a superior find, with beautiful customer servicing - or you could end up with some cranky leftover that isn't worth pennies and peanuts, from a foreign guy over the phone who refuses to give your money back.I'm happy to say that I belong to the former. Upon receiving the phone I find that it works just as intended. No (noticeable) cosmetic or functional damage, no problem switching my SIM card over, and while the battery capacity (86%) isn't exactly something to obsess over, the actual experience of using and charging it feels as if it just came fresh out the Apple Store.  Would definitely recommend this seller and this phone, especially for its price vs retail. However, mind you, make sure you purchase one that's in Excellent condition - I cannot reprimand or tell you about products of a lower grade, and nor can you expect much if it arrives as broken as a lot of these reviewers learnt the hard way. On that end, be sure to know your options if such happens.

I couldn’t be happier with my renewed iPhone. It’s the first time I have bought renewed and I’m  really impressed: phone looks and operates as brand new, at a fraction of the price. Reuse upgrade is better for the planet too. Max battery capacity reads as 95% but can easily last 48hrs with my usage. Delivered on time in quality protective packaging.
"
9860,B08PCCM1GC,5,"
The phone arrived super quickly. It is in a great condition (super minor scratches can be seen only if you look very closely). It works perfectly well, the battery has 93% of capacity.Overall I am very pleased with my purchase.

9861,B08PCCM1GC,5,"
IPhone 12 works fine as advertised
"
9862,B08PCCM1GC,4,"
There is a lot of dust and dirt on the handset and charging port of the mobile phone. I used a brush to clean them up carefully, and the battery is a little old, which is normal and acceptable. After all, this is a second-hand product, and other aspects are still okay.
"
9863,B08PCCM1GC,5,"
My iPhone X was giving up on me so I thought it was time for an upgrade. This phone is amazing, loads of new features and looks great too. Would recommend

9864,B08PCCM1GC,5,"
Packaging for the two iphones was very disappointing. both phones wrapped together in bubble wrap and in a flimsy carton which was not much bigger than the phones. However, the phones themselves were in great condition with no visible damage. About 6 weeks since purchase and all going well.

iPhone è arrivato in condizioni eccellenti sono soddisfatto La batteria e perfetta e le condizioni del cellulari veramente eccellenti. Posso dire come nuovo.
"
9867,B08PCCM1GC,4,"
Arrivato con un giorno di anticipo, il cellulare è esteticamente e funzionalmente perfetto, nessun graffio nè altri segni di uso neanche cercando con una lente d'ingrandimento. Non mi è piaciuta la confezione per via della protezione morbida che perdeva pelucchi e c'è voluto tempo prima di pulirlo bene per applicare il vetro protettivo (comprato a parte). La vera pecca però è la batteria il cui stato è 84% quindi prossima alla sostituzione.
"
9868,B08PCCM1GC,4,"
Sono molto contentx, grazie. Il materiale è molto moderno e anche il design. Sono passato da Android a Apple e posso dire che ne sono contento. Il passaggio era un po‘ faticoso ma è andato tutto a buon fine e anche la spedizione era molto veloce👍

Funzionalità perfetta. Batteria perfetta. Schermo intatto. Piccole tacche da probabile caduta sul margine della cornice (più di una). Tolgo quindi una stella perché non lo considero di prima scelta ma di condizioni accettabili. Mi va bene così ma non sono stato avvertito prima. Imballo inesistente scatolina di cartone in busta gialla pluriboll.  Consegna senza dover firmare.
"
9870,B08PCCM1GC,4,"
TELEFONO OK , BATTERIA ALL'86% PERO' TUTTO OK. PER IL MOMENTO CONSIGLIO VENDITORE. FARò ALTRI ACQUISTI IN FUTURO E VALUTERò NUOVAMENTE. SPERO POSITIVAMENTE
"
9871,B08PCCM1GC,4,"
Arrivato prima del previsto il telefono è esteticamente in condizioni eccellenti, come da descrizione, peccato che la batteria invece è all’87%, mi sarei aspettato una percentuale almeno sopra il 90%.
"
9872,B08PCCM1GC,4,"
Ho acquistato iPhone 12 pro in stato eccellente…telefono arrivato perfetto pari a nuovo non si direbbe che è un ricondizionato …L unica pecca è la batteria con vita all 83%..x essere pari a nuovo è un po’ poca xo posso dire che è attiva la applecare plus ancora in garanzia..per quanto riguarda il corriere è arrivato con due giorni di anticipo rispetto alla data indicata …ho richiesto la fattura e in meno di due ore mi è stata inviata tramite mail…lo comsiglio
"
9873,B08PCCM1GC,4,"
Ho comprato il dispositivo in “condizioni eccellenti” e sinceramente non mi aspettavo tanti segni di usura come quelli che ho trovato sugli angoli e bordi del telefono, più un segno sul vetro. Quindi tolgo una stella, ma solo una perché comunque sono cose che con cover e vetro di protezione non si notano. Per il resto il telefono è una bomba, la batteria un po’ meno, è all’88% e non dura tutta la giornata. Se penso però che nuovo costa 1200€, più o meno, e che l’ho pagato circa 750€ va benissimo così.
"
9874,B08PCCM1GC,4,"
Alors l’état rien a dire super état ; le chargeur par contre pas top première génération… l’état de la batterie 83% par contre il faut pas appeler sa excellent état je trouve ça vraiment pas top pour le prix
"
9875,B08PCCM1GC,4,"
Malgrado abbia contattato il venditore chiedendo una verifica della batteria prima della spedizione e mi sia proposta di pagare una differenza per un nuovo acquisto, anche in altro colore, di un prodotto migliore, l'iphone è arrivato con batteria solo al 86%. Lo provo un paio di giorni e valuto il reso
"
9876,B08PCCM1GC,5,"
Ritengo che oggi sia fondamentale riciclare il più possibile...ì cellulari ricondizionati rispettano l'ambiente e permettono a chi acquista di risparmiare molto. Sono soddisfatta dell'acquisto che ho però scelto cercando ricondizionato in OTTIME CONDIZIONI. Esteticamente non ha un difetto e per ora anche il suo funzionamento è perfetto.
"
9877,B08PCCM1GC,5,"
Sono pienamente soddisfatto, nessun problema. Anzi… la batteria originale Apple nuova (100%) nessun graffio… Un ringraziamento va al venditore.Avrei, forse potuto aspettare ancora un po’ … il prezzo probabilmente sarebbe calato. Ma va bene così… per un prodotto ricondizionato… - da quello che sento e leggo in giro - Ripeto Non posso assolutamente lamentarmi.

 Esteticamente impeccabile.Visto che ho scelto un prodotto dalle condizioni “eccellenti” mi aspettavo una percentuale di batteria più alta almeno superiore al 90% mentre la batteria attualmente misura circa 83%. Scalda un po’ quando è sotto carica ma forse quello credo sia una caratteristica del del telefono.

Prima volta che acquisto smartphone di fascia alta ricondizionati:- il telefono si presenta in un imballo Phonem ben fatto, eccezion fatta per la protezione dello schermo totalmente assente in quanto esposto completamente a urti sul lato superiore frontale della scatola;- presenta minuscole imperfezioni appena visibili, quindi prodotto eccellente.Lo sto usando da qualche giorno e sembra tutto perfetto: edizione USA con antenna 5G laterale, per ora funzionante in tutto e per tutto.Giudizio generale ottimo, ma le uniche due pecche, per le quali non mi sento di fornire 5 stelle (specificatamente per il secondo punto), sono le seguenti:- Batteria al 88% della capacità massima, ma comunque entro i limiti del 80% minimo, ma mi sarei aspettato di meglio;- Alimentatore e cavo sono di bassissima fattura  (brandizzati Phonem) e per giunta nemmeno a carica rapida.Per questo secondo punto la questione è alquanto deludente in quanto la quasi totalità degli altri clienti hanno trovato, pur se non originali ma nei limiti di vendita, alimentatori da almeno 20W e cavi USB-C to Lightning, adatti ad un telefono di questo livello, e non capisco per quale motivo nel mio caso siano stati rimpiazzati da questi, tra l’altro inadatti e poco funzionali, obbligandomi a dover temporaneamente usare il vecchio alimentatore e cavo originali del mio iPhone 7 in attesa di ricevere, con altri soldi spesi, alimentatore e cavo nuovi ordinati il giorno stesso.  Consiglierei di rivedere gli accessori obbligatori per telefoni di questa fascia e di mettere in armonia i prezzi sui diversi canali nei quali vendete, per prodotti identici in modello, grado, capacità e colore. Non aggiungo altro.Mi riservo di rivedere la recensione.Giudizio generale ottimo ma non eccellente, venditore più che consigliato.

Ich habe das iPhone 12 Pro in Graphit mit ausgezeichneten Zustand gekauft das iPhone ist aus den USA erkennbar anhand der Antenne die es hier in Europa nicht gibt aber das ist egal sollte nur gesagt sein. Der Ramen ist fast komplett drum rum mit leichten Kratzern versehen was mich persönlich nicht stört da ich es in einer Hülle benutze die Rückseite ist markellos also perfekt. Der einzigste richte Kritikpunkt ist der Akku mit einer Kapazität von nur 88% daher muss ich den Akku bei Apple für 75 Euro selbst wechseln lassen behalte das Gerät trotzdem an sich ein gutes iPhone für den preis.

Compré este terminal hace dos días. Me llegó en 24 horas por DHL. Al principio lo compré con cierta reticencia al no ser enviado por Amazon y no leer precisamente buenas críticas de este vendedor. Admito que me la jugué, y todo por ahorrar, pero pensé, si sale mal el experimento, siempre tengo la opción de devolverlo gracias a la garantía de Amazon. Decir que en este caso acerté, el teléfono vino en estado impoluto (lo elegí dentro de la categoría excelente). Eso sí, la batería me vino con el 86% de salud. Me hubiera gustado un porcentaje más alto, pero está dentro de lo que prometen. En resumen, en mi caso, sí que recomiendo comprar terminales reacondicionados de Amazon. Espero que a alguien le haya servido de ayuda este comentario. Un saludo a tod@s y bona nit 😉

J'ai reçu le smartphone hier et j'ai été surprise agréablement en voyant l'aspect extérieur en excellent état ! Aucune rayures. Quelques traces de doigts seulement. En revanche l'état de la batterie 88% je suis moyennement contente. Ce qui m'a le plus déçu et franchement c'est abusé, un chargeur de 1ere génération !!! J'ai mis en charge hier le iphone car quasi plus de batterie quand je l'ai reçu, il a charger pendant 3h pour être à 100%, non mais sérieux, le vendeur aurait pu mettre un nouveau chargeur. En plus je n'ai pas reçu les écouteurs donc dégoûtée.

Sono veramente sorpreso dalla qualità del prodotto: Iphone nuovissimo, non ha neanche un graffietto. Lo stato della batteria è al 100% (sicuramente la terrò sotto controllo in questi mesi ma, se non aggiornerò la recensione, è perché non necessita di aggiornamenti). I venditori sono stati gentilissimi nel rispondermi subito circa un piccolo ritardo dovuto alla settimana del Black Friday. Il prodotto era inoltre ben sigillato, dotato anche di carica batterie. Non potevo farmi un regalo di Natale migliore!

Tutto molto bello, ma pagare 700€ e passa un telefono che dovrebbe essere in ottime condizioni ma con un graffione evidente sul display mi fa rodere parecchio. Inizialmente mi sembrava essere sulla pellicola, ma dopo averla sostituita con un’altra ho capito fosse sul vetro.Sarebbe stato il caso di segnalarlo considerando che è un difetto che si nota anche a più di 30cm di distanza. Ci sarebbe da dire che la fotocamera interna faccia pensare che non sia un iPhone, ovviamente lascia a desiderare. Il resto tutto ok, qualche altro piccolo difetto estetico ma passabile; batteria in buone condizioni.Non sono molto soddisfatta e ovviamente mi asterrò da fare acquisti in futuro da questo venditore.

A primera vista todo parece en buen estado, pero a la que empiezas a fijarte vas encontrando ralladas en la pantalla.El dispositivo viene sin limpiar… en mi caso tenía pegamento en el marco del teléfono.A los días he visto que la batería se gastaba con rapidez, con un uso mediano no podía llegar a las 10h, en mi caso ha llegado con un 86% de salud de batería a los días ha bajado 84%, la verdad a no ser que queráis 1 año de garantía o similar os recomiendo que busquéis uno en Wallapop que seguramente costará menos i tendrá un mejor estado que el “reacondicionado” o prepararos para gastar 75€ en una nueva batería.

"
9921,B08PCCM1GC,3,"
Premetto che è la prima volta in vita mia che compro un device ricondizionato perché sono abbastanza maniacale sulle mie cose. Ma data la situazione per cui mi serviva questo iphone sono stato disposto a qualche compromesso.Lo stato generale del telefono è più che buono. È arrivato senza la scatola originale ed imballato nella plastica antiurto dentro un pacchetto DHL assicurato.- Packaging non ci siamo proprio! - Capisco che si tratta di un ricondizionato ma un minimo di attenzione per uno smartphone di questa fascia credo ci voglia (ma questo è solo un consiglio per il venditore).Venendo al succo:Estetica ok!Ci sono dei graffietti qua e là, come si vede dalle immagini ma si tratta di graffi di utilizzo, probabilmente è stato esposto (ribadisco, io li noto perché in telefoni che uso quotidianamente da 3/4 anni quei graffi non ci sono ma per qualcuno potrebbero essere graffi fatti in poche settimane di utilizzo).Probabilmente il graffio sulla parte esterna del monitor (vicino allo slot della sim) è il peggiore, più profondo degli altri, probabilmente una caduta senza cover.La cosa peggiore è quella macchia in basso. Dalle foto si vede poco, non si tratta di un riflesso o di una ""ditata"" come potrebbe sembrare. Credo sia stata rovinata la scocca con qualche tipo di abrasione, forse con qualche prodotto che ha tolto il colore. Questo è piuttosto fastidioso ed è una delle motivazioni che mi fa dare 3 stelle.L'altra cosa che terrò sotto controllo è la batteria.Non appena arrivato ho fatto un controllo generale notando che la batteria era al 99% del suo stato di utilizzo.""Wow ho pensato, praticamente nuova!""Mentre scrivo lo sto utilizzando da due settimane e la batteria è scesa al 96% (con una ricarica al giorno).Questa cosa non è proprio normale, non vorrei che nel processo di ricondizionamento sia stata usata una batteria poco adeguata o fallata.Monitorerò la cosa e magari aggiornerò la recensione (se non mi sentite la cosa si è fermata la) ;-)

Cet iPhone 12 Pro reconditionné est impeccable, on le croirait neuf, seule la capacité de la batterie à 91% indique un smartphone d'occasion.  Tout fonctionne de manière fluide, la mise à jour sur iOS 16.1 n'a pas posé de souci et il tient la charge toute la journée - mais je ne joue pas en ligne et je ne regarde pas de séries.  Le bleu pacifique est superbe !10/10 pour le vendeur Certicom en Espagne.  J'ai reçu mon iPhone avant la date prévue dans une boîte blanche générique avec un câble et un chargeur MFI : plus qu'Apple ne fournit ces jours-ci !  J'ai malgré tout acheté un chargeur rapide 20W et un câble Lightning, tous les deux Apple, sur Amazon Warehouse.Bizarre quand même que le livreur (Colis Privé) mette le colis dans la boîte à lettres sans signature, ce n'est pas trop sécurisé...

Arrivato in una scatola anonima con una pellicola di vetro, cover, caricatore e cavetto nuovi (non originali), il prodotto è buono, schermo e retro perfetti, ha solo dei segni di usura (piccoli graffi) sui bordi in acciaio. Il mio è il modello americano, quello con l’antenna 5g per le onde millimetriche, la batteria ha l’89% di capacità, uniche pecche più fastidiose secondo me, è il fatto che un pulsante del volume sia un po’ più “rientrato” rispetto all’altro, le griglie in basso per speaker e microfono non sembrano state riassemblate correttamente (sono un po’ troppo rientrate) e lo schermo nel lato in basso a destra è un po’ scollato, quindi non mi sento di poterlo immergere in acqua con molta sicurezza, per il resto tutto buono

Il device funziona alla perfezione ed a prima vista esteticamente è ineccepibile, anche la batteria risulta pari al nuovo.Guardando con un pizzico di attenzione in più la qualità non è proprio eccellente, ho trovato dei segni sul bordo anteriore dello smart-watch, niente di particolarmente grave, ma la cosa che più si evidenzia è che sull'oggetto che mi è arrivato risulta perfettamente visibile che è stato sostituito il vetro anteriore, in controluce e in condizioni di scarso contrasto a schermo spento, si vede perfettamente come la riparazione non sia stata effettuata in modo professionale. La colla che si stende fra vetro e touch screen non è stata stesa alla perfezione e non copre tutto lo schermo, i risultato è che si vedono i contorni della colla, è vero che si notano solo in determinate condizioni, ma si notano e questo va in contrasto con la descrizione che viene fornita al momento della ricerca. Non è in eccellenti condizioni ma direi più in buone condizioni, detto questo per il resto niente da dire sia per la consegna sia per l'imballaggio e tanto meno sul perfetto funzionamento. Peccato per quel difettuccio che un po rovina il giudizio. Non so se a questo punto lo terrò, valuterò nei prossimi giorni quanto questa cosa mi rimane per la gola.

Looked like it was taken directly out of someone's phone case, and not cleaned.I was expecting a lot better for seven hundred Euro.You know, with a little effort, stainless steel can be polished, to get rid of scratches.Man, I really don't like leaving negative reviews.I was buying this for one of the Ukrainian children living with me.I would have been embarrassed giving this phone to her.I'll give it two stars, since a phone was actually delivered to me.I immediately returned this phone.Bought a new iPhone 13 instead.This was my first experience with a refurbished phone.I 'd be very reluctant to buy a refurbished phone again.I'm giving five stars for the screen and storage, not having seen either, I trust that they were as described.In addition to this refurbished phone that I returned, I also bought an Apple iPhone 12 Pro, 128GB from Swappie.For the same price, it is like a brand new phone - in immaculate condition.Oh, and I'm still waiting for my refund from Ava Direct.I suppose I'll get it, some day...

El teléfono está muy bien,la carcasa y la pantalla están cambiadas,ni un arañazo visible,la única pega es que no es rosa,más bien blanco,y he probado varios protectores de pantalla y ninguno ajusta a la perfección,debe tener algún tipo de fallo esta pantalla o todos los protectorws son malos

El producto llegó un día antes, entiendo que el producto es reacondicionado, pero indica que no tiene marcas visibles a 20cm, el caso que llegó con todas las esquinas con picadas, visible a más de 40cm, la batería al 95% y la pantalla perfecta, pero estéticamente se ven marcas de caídas. El teléfono lo envío ciclozero, no creo que vuelva a comprar un reacondicionado, al meno de esta marca. Por lo demás genial, el cargador es “chino” y el cable parece original.

Nulla da dire riguardo al telefono che è pari al nuovo, tutto perfettamente funzionante, batteria al 99% e zero graffi o imperfezioni.Riguardo alla spedizione però, purtroppo, mi sono trovata davvero male. Non mi aspettavo la confezione originale apple in quanto in descrizione era scritto che sarebbe stato consegnato in una scatola anonima, però non mi aspettavo neanche di trovarmi, una volta aperto il pacco, il telefono già acceso e quasi scarico avvolto solo da una busta di plastica e dall’imballaggio sempre in plastica. Nessuna scatolina anonima come promesso dalla descrizione e anche il caricatore avvolto da una plastica sottile.Ad ogni modo il telefono funziona e pare non aver subito danni in seguito all’evidente carenza di un imballaggio come si deve.

Gekauft als generalüberholt. Gerät schaut brandneu aus, wie frisch vom Band gefallen: keinerlei Kratzer, Macken oder ähnliches! Wer braucht da noch neu kaufen?!Für mich persönlich war das 12 Pro jedoch leider zu groß und zu schwer. 1-Hand-Bedienung oft schwierig und in der Hosentasche hat man das Gerät deutlich gespürt. Des weiteren wirkt meiner Meinung nach das 12er (& 13er) Modell aufgrund des eckigen (Retro-) Designs dicker und unergonomischer als z.B. ein 11er Modell mit den abgerundeten Ecken. Gerät wurde deshalb umgetauscht. Rückabwicklung ohne Probleme!

Il telefono è pari al nuovo in condizioni perfette, arrivato con gls in una confezione improvvisata ma ben protetto. Il venditore ha aggiunto un carica batterie di iPhone X e precedenti in più la spilletta togli sim. L’iPhone è il modello americano perché presenta l’antenna supplementare per il 5G necessaria per gli Stati Uniti d’America che si trova sul lato destro del telefono. Per questo il prezzo è più conveniente ma ripeto il telefono è pari al nuovo è solo una questione estetica che può interessare come no. Comunque venditore con ottimi prodotti ma deludente per quanto riguarda l’assistenza. Avevo mandato un paio di mail per la tracciabilita del pacco e non ho mai avuto risposta. Anche sul numero di cellulare ho mandato un messaggio whatsapp che ancora non riceve, ho anche provato a chiamare ma era sempre spento. Ma a me interessa che il telefono funzioni e che sia in ottimo stato.  Comunque Incrocio le dita e darò notizie in seguito.

Il telefono è arrivato in una scatola anonima dotato di carica batterie e cavetto + spilletta per la sim.Il telefono in se non presenta nessun graffio o segno di usura e la capacità della batteria è al 100% quindi è un telefono nuovo! Consegna rapida, il giorno dopo la data prevista, arrivato proprio in tempo. Sono davvero soddisfatta anche per quanto riguarda la serietà del venditore e la risposta rapida dei messaggi. Prezzo davvero ottimo in quanto telefono identico al nuovo, poiché comprando uno nuovo nei negozi apple ancora si pagano sui 1000€ . Sono molto soddisfatta, lo consiglio

Ho acquistato un Iphone 12 proPensavo acquistando un prodotto ricondizionato che avesse qualche imperfezione, invece zero, nessuna, il prodotto è pari al nuovo. Arrivato in tre giorni, buona confezione, pacchetto con logo ""loop"", dentro caricabatterie e chiavetta per sim, oltre le istruzioni. L'ho portato a mettere la cover ed il venditore si è complimentato per lo stato del cellulare. Che dire fa foto splendide, il riconoscimento facciale è perfetto per l'home banking e per le altre app, la velocità è portentosa, il suono anche. Un consiglio anche se condizionato scegliete il venditore e non badate a risparmiare. C'è sempre il detto di chi più spende, meglio spende.

Diese Rezension beschreibt NICHT das iPhone 12, sondern den Kauf bei ""Amazon Renewed""/""Mobihub.de"".LieferungDie Lieferung wurde nach zwei Tagen zugestellt. Neben dem iPhone lagen noch ein No Name-Ladegerät und eine Sim-Nadel im Paket. OVP und die originalen Apple Zubehöre waren - wie in der Artikelbeschreibung erwähnt - nicht enthalten.Äußerer ZustandDer äußere Zustand des iPhones entsprach ebenfalls der Artikelbeschreibung: aus 30 Zentimeter Entfernung waren überhaupt keine Gebrauchsspuren erkennbar. Selbst bei genauer Betrachtung erwiesen sich alle Oberflächen als makellos. Das möchte ich extra hervorheben: Das Gerät ist ziemlich genau ein Jahr alt und hat trotzdem eine neuwertige Optik.Die Schalter/Taster am Gehäuse sind ebenso in Ordnung. Einziger kleiner Schwachpunkt: Der Lautlos-Schalter ist sehr schwergängig. Es wirkt, als ob im Inneren des Schalters fest gebackener Staub wäre. Die Funktionalität ist dadurch jedoch nicht eingeschränkt. Man kann den Schalter halt nicht ""so nebenbei"" betätigen, sondern muss sich darauf konzentrieren und die Rückmeldung am Display kontrollieren.TechnikDas iPhone war auf Werkseinstellungen zurückgesetzt und konnte problemlos gestartet/installiert werden.Im Betrieb treten keinerlei Fehlfunktionen auf.Der Akku ist bei akzeptablen 89 %. Das liegt im Korridor der Artikelbeschreibung (""über 80 %""). Es lässt aber auch auf eine intensive Nutzung im ersten Lebensjahr schließen.FazitBei Renewed/Refurbished-Angeboten ist natürlich keine allgemeine Aussage möglich, da sich jedes Exemplar vom anderen unterscheiden kann.Für ""mein"" iPhone kann ich sagen: bisher ein Kauf ohne Reue. Das Produkt entspricht der Artikelbeschreibung. Es gibt keinen Anlass zu Kritik.Und sollte doch noch ein Fehler auftauchen, würde die Garantie von 12 Monaten greifen.

Il prodotto oltre ad avere qualche segno di usura (che comprendo possa avere in quanto ricondizionato) aveva delle macchie di grasso che potevano benissimo essere quantomeno tolte prima di metterlo in commercio.La cosa imperdonabile è sicuramente l'audio danneggiato. Ho ascoltato varie canzoni comparandolo con un'altra 12 pro e con il mio si sente distorto. Persino comprando la suoneria, nel mio caso si sente che non è pulita ma con una leggera distorsione. Per me che lavoro nel settore musicale è un guasto imperdonabileNon ha alcun senso acquistare un ricondizionato se poi non vengono fatti i test a dovere per sostituire parti danneggiate...Per questo richiederò il rimborsoPer questa ragione richiederò il rimborso

9996,B08PCCM1GC,3,"
Il telefono è venuto molto bello, senza grafie e con la batteria 90%. Però lo schermo sembra di essere stato cambiato perché il touchscreen è molto lento. Non è veloce come un schermo originale. Avevo pensato di essere colpa della pellicola, ma no. È proprio del telefono.

Prodotto rigenerato, consegnato in tempi celeri. Il prodotto si presenta in una scatola generica Loop, lo smartphone all’interno compreso di cavo e in uno scatolo separato il caricabatterie da 30w. Il telefono è in perfette condizioni estetiche, batteria al 98% (nel giro di qualche settimana scesa al 96%). Unica pecca, durante la prima configurazione ho notato con mio profondo dispiacere, una piccola, quasi impercettibile macchiolina nera nel lato basso/sinistro del display confinante con il bordo del display (sicuramente Pixel Bruciato). Non ho chiesto la sostituzione perché resterei a piedi(senza smartphone) e ne ho necessità per lavoro. Per me questo problema è un pugno in faccia perché da quando l’ho notato mi porta nervoso (mi cade l'occhio lì) visto la fiducia riposta è il prezzo pagato.

Tras estar bastante escéptico a comprar un iphone reacondicionado, me animé teniendo en cuenta la garantía de amazon y que en caso de que tuviera cualquier problema lo podía devolver y listo. Pues bien, el teléfono ha llegado en muy buena condición. Ningún rasguño en la carcasa y un pequeño arañazo casi imperceptible en la pantalla principal, que además viene cubierta de un protector. La salud de la batería está al 92%. La verdad es que para mí este punto es muy importante y un 92% para mí si es aceptable. Seguiré probándolo pero por ahora solo estoy teniendo buenas sensaciones y si todo sigue así me quedaré el dispositivo. Muy contento.

Modello destinato al mercato americano in quanto provvisto di modulo 5G mmWave che si può notare da una tacca appena percettibile al di sotto del pulsante di accensione, ma non sfruttabile in Italia (per ora).

Wie von Apple zu erwarten, hat dieses Telefon keinerlei Macken, hängt sich nie auf und sieht optisch (bis auf die gewöhnungsbedürftige Notch) nicht schlecht aus. Die Kameras funktionieren einwandfrei und während eines Videos kann es perfekt zwischen den verschiedenen Linsen wechseln, ohne das das Videomaterial darunter leidet. Da es das erste Apple iPhone für mich ist, muss ich mich noch von umständlichen Android hin zum einfach zu bedienenden Alleskönner umstellen. Der Batteriezustand ist leider nur bei 88% gewesen, aber er hält trotzdem den Tag durch.Klare Kaufempfehlung an dieser Stelle für das iPhone 12 Pro in der 128 GB Variante.Da ich leider keinen 5G-fähigen Vertrag habe, kann ich dazu nichts sagen, aber LTE /4G reicht für normale Zwecke vollkommen aus.

Nel corso della vita ho acquistato diversi telefoni. Tanti nuovi e diversi ricondizionati.Se si ragiona con calma e a sangue freddo si capisce che si può ottenere ottimo prodotto di modello precedente ( rispetto quello che si vende adesso) a un prezzo davvero interessante ( non regalato).Preso su Amazon e lo utilizzo da due mesi. Non vedo nessun minimo difetto, funziona perfettamente, batteria nuova e nessun graffio o segno di usura. Vi consiglio vivamente di considerare ricondizionato al posto del nuovo

Compré el Iphone 12pro en condición supuestamente excelente por 809€ , Según la descripción y sus términos, no debería tener arañazos ni desperfectos estéticos en pantalla, laterales ni marcas visibles a 30cm de distancia, lo cual no se cumplió en ningún aspecto. Cabe decir que fue el único que rebajaron 100€ en 1semana y decían que era el último en stock, a pesar de que repusieron 1 o 2 más, sin embargo al pedir un cambio, me dijeron que no tenían ninguno en stock en esas condiciones. Para mi sorpresa, me encuentro lo que veis en las fotos. Un terminal en Condiciones satisfactorias y además me querían cobrar 12€ de envío para la devolución. Tuve que recurrir a Amazon y a las cláusulas de Amazon Renewed para llevar a cabo la devolución para recibir el reembolso integro.Experiencia muy mala...

Avevo bisogno di sostituire il mio iPhone 7 per via della memoria, attualmente di soli 32 GB.Scorro tra le offerte di Amazon e mi capita questo iPhone, nel formato da 512 GB, a 989 euro.Lo acquisto, forte della garanzia Amazon di un anno. Acquistato e spedito Venerdì, consegnato martedì mattina.Il telefono arriva in una confezione non originale, completo di cavo usb-c lightning, estrattore sim e, udite udite, caricatore usb-c da 30 watt.Il telefono è praticamente perfetto; ha solo una piccola ammaccatura nell’angolo inferiore sinistro, perfettamente camuffata dalla cover. Batteria al 91%, garanzia Apple fino al 8 gennaio 2022. Che altro chiedere di più? Personalmente nulla.Lo consiglio? Si, al 1000%

Telefono in condizioni veramente eccellenti, zero graffi ne niente, è perfettamente funzionante. Ho fatto un affare.

L'iPhone est arrivé rapidement, bien emballé et avec l'ensemble des accessoires (non-Apple mais fonctionnels). L'écran est impeccable, la tranche chromée et l'arrière de l'iPhone également. Aucune rayure. La face arrière dépasse légèrement du cadre, peut-être qu'elle a été remplacée et n'est pas d'origine ? Si c'est le cas j'aurais aimé que cela soit partagé dans la description.... Santé de a batterie à 98%, ce qui est plutôt très bien pour un reconditionné.

Rimpiango il vecchio 6 plus, che ho cambiato dopo sei anni, causa  vetro rotto e batteria esaurita, mai cambiata. Il 12 pro, anche se ricondizionato con batteria al 90%, ha una ridotta durata della batteria, di gran lunga inferiore alle prestazioni dichiarate e attese. L'unico aspetto apprezzato è il grandangolo e l'uso con poca luce della fotocamera.

 Come descritto nella presentazione del prodotto, l’iPhone arriva in una confezione anonima e non presenta evidenti segni di usura. purtroppo le videocamere nella parte posteriore sembrano essere particolarmente state soggette a graffi all’interno delle tasche o come stato maneggiato.Mi riservo di fornire un ulteriore aggiornamento della mia recensione dopo averlo provato per almeno due o tre settimane

Compro el iPhone sabiendo que es re acondicionado cojo la opción de estado excelente…me viene el teléfono y si…de apariencia impoluto pero por dentro está echo mirrda literalmente…la cámara trasera no funciona, se queda pillado. La solución del vendedor es que se lo devuelva y yo me quede sin teléfono y sin dinero y no estoy dispuesta porque son casi 800 euritos

Le téléphone fonctionne parfaitement, il parait neuf je suis très content de l'achat après quelques jours d'utilisation. Cependant le chargeur fourni fonctionne mais charge très lentement il faut penser à racheter un câble mais sinon tout est nickel
"
10059,B08PCCM1GC,4,"
ok
"
10060,B08PCCM1GC,5,"
No viene en su caja original ni con cargador-cable original. Pero está completamente NUEVO, ni un solo rasguño, ni al sol. La batería está al 86% lo cual está bien ya que prometen un mínimo de 80%. El terminal va super bien para lo que un iPhone se le espera.En mi caso estoy contento con este producto reacondicionado. El tiempo dirá si ha sido una buena inversión.

10061,B08PCCM1GC,5,"
Mi sono rivolto ad Amazon per l’acquisto del cellulare rigenerato sicuro che non sarei rimasto deluso. Le aspettative sono state ampiamente confermate. Il cellulare è assolutamente pari al nuovo, con una capacità residua del 96% della batteria e l’assoluta assenza di imperfezioni. Ottimo acquisto come sempre Amazon è una garanzia in più.

 Prima e sicuramente ultima esperienza con un telefono ricondizionato. La confezione poteva essere curata meglio mettendo una pellicola protettiva adesiva sullo schermo,Il telefono era stato ripulito sommariamente aveva polvere e sporcizia sia nell attacco di ricarica della batteria che bello sportellino sim che intorno alle fotocamere inoltre non ho potuto valutare niente altro in quanto. On sono riuscito neanche a configurarlo perché dopo selezionata la lingua alla selezione del paese il telefono si bloccava e dopo venti secondi mi rimandava alla selezione della lingua.

Pagato rigenertao circa 850€. Esteticamente molto bene, ma batteria al 90% (ok che ancora buona ma x 850€ la potevano cambiare), problemi di connessione bluetooth (sia watch, sia airpods, sia altre marche….no), problemi di connessione con la macchina.Restituito subito
"
10066,B08PCCM1GC,3,"
The phone arrived in perfect conditions the only problem I’ve seen is with the battery it dies quite faster than expected but that also might be related to the usage I give to it but it doesn’t lasts all day long.
"

Super, je suis ravie de mon achat

10068,B08PCCM1GC,3,"
Acquistato dopo aver visto alcune recensioni, ma sono rimasto un po’ deluso. Batteria al 89% e con alcuni graffi sul lo schermo e al entrata del carica batteria. Il se ascolti una canzone il telefono si scarica in maniera folle. Pensavo davvero che avessi più qualità.

Absoluter Fehlkauf! Habe das iPhone mit ausgezeichnetem Zustand bestellt. Das Gerät kam absolut verschmutzt an. Die Lautsprecher sind völlig verdreckt und dicht. Die Akkuleistung betrug gerade mal noch 85%. Also definitiv nicht generalüberholt! Noch dazu war eine fremde Simkarte im Telefon und es kamen ausländische Nachrichten an. Die Verpackung wurde mit Aufklebern komplett zugeklebt, dass eine schadensfreie Entfernung nicht möglich war.Suchen sie sich einen anderen Verkäufer für ihr Gerät. Katastrophe. Nie wieder!
"
10075,B08PCCM1GC,5,"
Also ich bin echt begeistert. Die Lieferung erfolgte wirklich sehr schnell und der Zustand ist wirklich 1a. 100% Batterie, kaum äußerliche Gebrauchsspuren. Echt Top!
"
10076,B08PCCM1GC,5,"
Absolut zu empfehlen. Ist mein erstes iPhone, ich wollte zusätzlich zum Preis auch die Umwelt schonen und daher ein refurbished kaufen. Allerdings war ich etwas unsicher was mich wohl erwarten würde… alles super! Der Akku liegt bei 98% Kapa, und der Zustand ist echt der Hammer. Bis auf ein paar Mikrokratzer am seitlichen Rahmen alles top. Kann’s nur jedem empfehlen!
"
10077,B08PCCM1GC,5,"
Il telefono è pari al nuovo, a dir poco impeccabile. Il modo con cui è stato impacchettato a mio dire pessimo. Per il resto davvero ottimo davvero.
"
10078,B08PCCM1GC,1,"
L’iPhone 12 pro che ho acquistato ricondizionato come condizioni “eccellenti” presenta delle imperfezioni estetiche ed inoltre una vite in prossimità del connettore lightnin è leggermente svitata.Durante le prime prove di funzionamento ho subito notato una bassa potenza e qualità dell’audio sonoro dell’altoparlante. Successivamente mi sono accorto che la cuffia per le chiamate audio non funziona. Provvederò al rimborso

Ich holte mir das iPhone 12 Pro in Pazifikblau.Das Gerät sieht tatsächlich aus wie neu, kein kleinster Kratzer, nichts. Das Display ist super und die Akkulaufzeit ist wie bei einem Neugerät.Der Versand ging sehr flott und sicher verpackt. Dazu gab‘s noch ein Ladekabel.Wer gerne etwas Geld sparen möchte und nicht das neuste und aktuellste Modell haben muss sollte hier zuschlagen. Volle Kaufempfehlung von mir!

Lo compré, dentro de pocos dias empezó a calentar, si Quito la tarjeta de telefonía el móvil estaba bien, al poner la tarjeta empezaba a calentar hasta que no se podía más tener el móvil en la mano y no respondía la pantalla. La batería completa se descargaba en 10 min cuando empezaba el mensaje de calentamiento.No se otros productos de ellos pues sólo compre una vez, pero mi experiencia fue FATAL. No se puede fiar de un móvil así sin verlo. Mejor comprar de algún conocido

Acquistato con qualità eccellente e quindi con graffi visibili ad un massimo di 30 cm ma in realtà presenta un danno importante sull'angolo. Reso obbligatorio!
"
10095,B08PCCM1GC,1,"
Me ha gustado la rapidez. No me ha gustado que no tenga caja, ni cargador y cable original ni la aguja para sacar la sim. Tiene un precio elevado para ser reacondicionado con esas faltas. También tenía un rozón en una esquina.Deberían especificar los detalles del producto antes de enviarlo y evitar sorpresas desagradables. Además hay que pagar por devolverlo.

Das gebrauchte IPhone12 pro kam wie angekündigt in einer neutralen Verpackung mit Ladekabel und Zubehöradapter. Die Lieferung war schneller als angekündigt. Der Akku bei 93%, also alles super…?Leider konnte ich nur über den Lautsprecher telefonieren, die Hörmuschel funktioniert nicht.Apple hat hierzu auch schon mitgeteilt:„Apple hat festgestellt, dass es bei einem sehr kleinen Prozentsatz von iPhone 12- und iPhone 12 Pro-Geräten aufgrund einer eventuell fehlerhaften Komponente des Hörermoduls in manchen Fällen zu Tonproblemen kommen kann. Betroffene Geräte wurden zwischen Oktober 2020 und April 2021 hergestellt.Wenn dein iPhone 12 oder iPhone 12 Pro beim Tätigen oder Empfangen von Anrufen keinen Ton aus dem Hörer abgibt, ist es möglicherweise für Service qualifiziert.Qualifizierte Geräte werden von Apple oder einem autorisierten Apple Service Provider kostenlos repariert“Nur war dies bei dem gelieferten nicht mehr möglich, da die Garantiezeit abgelaufen war - das Telefon also nicht mehr „qualifiziert“ war.Das hätte eigentlich bei einem Test auffallen müssen. Werde das Telefon daher zurück schicken.

Handy war optimistisch entsprechend der Vorstellung (kleiner optisch gut sichtbarer Kratzer entsprach nicht der Vorstellungwar aber akzeptabel für den Preis). Nach wenigen Minuten des Aufladens war klar, dass das Handy zurück zum Verkäufer geht, denn der Ladevorgang wurde immer wieder unterbrochen und dann wieder verbunden. Enttäuschend da dieses Problem doch im Vorfeld hätte erkannt werden müssen!

I wanted to buy the iPhone 14 pro max but it was out of stock at the time, this phone was my second choice and I’m honestly glad I bought it. Despite lacking a few of the flagship features found in the 14 pro,(such as a 120 hertz display, a few camera upgrades and the dynamic island) it still punches above its weight it terms of quality. After looking at the specifications of this phone and comparing it to the pro model, there are far more similarities than differences. The camera is still spectacular and apart from the macro lens, you would struggle to see the differences in pictures taken with both phones. To summarise, it’s a great phone that’s worth the money

Apple return to making a large version of their normal handset for the first time since the 8 plus and what a brilliant bit of kit it is.I find the cameras on a standard iPhone superb and more than good enough for my needs. For the iPhone 12 & 13 I’ve had to get the Pro Max to get the larger screen.Don’t get me wrong, the pro max is a great phone but unless you’re a serious photographer it’s likely the camera’s never going to reach its potential with the average user.Being able to buy the 256GB version of the standard iPhone for more or less the price of the 128GB pro Max is a real yes please moment.As an avid product red buyer I’m also delighted to be able to go back to red. The Pro Max has never been available in any of the colours I like so I’ve always hidden it in a case.The iPhone 14 Plus is fast, the battery life a massive improvement, the cameras are excellent and the price point, whilst expensive, offers the average user more for their money.

10181,B0BDHR3MHB,5,"
Purchased the new iPhone 14 after getting fed up with my old iPhone 6s for a year or so?This is great technology and although it was expensive, Amazon at least gave me 5% off. Could not get anything as trade-in from Apple, so this was a bonus. Changing over to the new iPhone is now very easy.
"
10182,B0BDHR3MHB,5,"
I never had a plus iPhone and I didn't want to spend that much money to get the Pro Max, so this iPhone 14 plus was perfect, the size of the phone and the battery are great.

After a couple of months, without hesitation, this is just a great phone and red colour/finish is gorgeous

I love this phone. I've never had an iPhone so from my perspective this item is insanely good.The screen is large, battery lasts long and the camera is extremely good (it supersedes what I had on my previous phones). It's expensive but worth the money.However, from what I understood, the refresh frame on the screen on the Plus version is a bit lower than the Pro. So perhaps if you are picky when it comes to iphones, look into that because it might bother you. It doesnt bother me at all (due to my previous phone being total garbo).5/5 stars! Love it :)

Not much change from the 13 series but I come from series 11. It’s a huge leap. Amazing camera. Very fast. Clear screen. Amazing camera. Brilliant operating system. Crash detection on this model. Get at least 256gb one as you’ll need it. You will need to pay iCloud storage too as 5gb free isn’t enough.

Very nice phone with large screen and some fancy new features. Would highly recommend this for value for money as it’s the same screen as the pro but for less money.

Bought this phone due to upgrading from 11 pro max as I love my big phones ! . It’s really big same size of a pro max . The battery life is much better than my last phone as it lasts much longer . It’s basically pro max but only with 2 cameras ☺️ ! Very happy ! Best phone yet ☺️

The iPhone 14 Plus is extremely bad value. Apart from a slightly larger screen, there are no standout features that make this superior than last years iPhone 13. Even worse, if you pay a little bit more, you can get the flagship iPhone 14 Pro! My biggest question is who did Apple make this for?!

J’ai mis 2 mois à me décider, entre choisir un iPhone 14 , 14 plus ou 13 pro max … désirant un écran assez grand le choix c’est donc fait entre la qualité photo du 13 pro max et la légèreté et l’autonomie du 14 plus . Perso mon utilité personnelle se contente de l’objectif du 14 plus ( et il est déjà pas mal !) question autonomie croyez le ou non le 14 plus me fait 48 h voir plus ! ( jeux , réseaux , Visio …) le 13 pro max pour la même utilité fait un peu moins de 48h (testé) . J’ai donc opté pour le 14 plus et j’en suis ravi, le prix reste élevé mais justifié pour un iPhone de ce genre

Migrating from a iPhone 7 plus after long five years, where the single complaint was battery life, I decided for an upgrade. No charger was provided, but at the end, I've accumulated so many, that this was really not an issue. But a USB-C cable was provided, which is a good help for faster charging. Migrating Apps and settings was really the best experience I had: By starting the new Phone I've had the option for migration, which required just a confirmation on my old device. Passwords were ""automagically"" transferred and in less than one hour everything landed on the new device. Everything was working, including Apple CarPlay and other Apple stuff. Third party Apps were almost Ok, except for very special cases like Bank Account Apps and Authenticators.Other concern was FaceID, since the previous used the fingerprint sensor, but this also worked like a charm, after following the configuration wizard.

10205,B0BDHR3MHB,5,"
Certes l’iPhone et iOS sont une combinaison parfaite. L’écran est très agréable pour naviguer, visionner des vidéos, jouer. Une finition et des matériaux de bonnes factures. Un poids contenu malgré sa taille. Mais le prix, le prix… cher pour une appareil qui ne profite que d’un écran plus grand et recycle le processeur de la génération précédente. Rien de nouveau pour le reste, si vous désirez rester au format plus compact, alors prenez un iPhone 13, le 14 ne vous apportera rien de plus, enfin si, une facture plus salée.

Super schnelle Lieferung und Abwicklung. Beim starten hat er zwar ein Update verlangt, aber war nicht schlimm. Ich kann im allgemeinen noch nicht viel darüber sagen, da ich es noch komplett einrichten muss und mir ein Panzerglas drauf machen lassen möchte. Es ist schon recht groß im Gegensatz zum alten und schwerer. Aber man wusste ja die Größe des Handys laut Hersteller. Wie es sich im Alltag bewährt, wird sich raus stellen. Ich muss es jetzt in Ruhe einrichten. Farbe finde ich okay. Vielleicht in ein paar Monaten mehr.

Bin vom Iphone 12 umgestiegen da ich, ende fünfzig, einfach ein wenig größere Buchstaben brauche (scheiß Altersweitsichtigkeit). Ich bin äußerst zufrieden mit dem Wechsel, whatsapp, Zeitung, Email  etc. sind jetzt (zur Not) auch ohne Lesebrille lesbar. Das Pro max war mir schlicht zu teuer, dessen sicher super Kamera wäre für meine Bedürfnisse überzogen, die Kamera des ""normalen"" 14/14 plus ist schon super für mich. Ob 60 hz oder 120 hz Anzeige ist mir egal, ich bin kein Gamer. Alles in Allem ein tolles, großes Telefon mit dem man für die nächsten Jahre bedient sein wird.  Ansonsten ist es natürlich unübertroffen wie Apple alles zu einen Ökosystem zusammengeführt hat, Iphone, Ipad, Iwatch und Apple TV harmonieren perfekt zusammen, ohne das übliche Geärgere wie bei Android üblich sobald es um mehr als ein Gerät geht.Update nach ein paar Tagen Nutzung im Vergleich zum iPhone pro max meiner Freundin: was sofort auffällt ist dass das Pro deutlich schwerer ist, meiner Freundin ist es egal, deren Handy ist in der Handtasche die eh ungefähr 2 kg Kram enthält, ich habe das Handy in der Jacke, da ist mir das leichte Plus deutlich lieber. Der zweite große Unterschied ist der Akku, das Plus schafft bei mir fast zwei Tage, das Pro nur gut einen.Ich bin auch nach dem Vergleich sehr zufrieden mit der Entscheidung für das Plus und gegen das Pro

Ich bin sehr zufrieden mit dem Smartphone. Dass es sich hierbei nicht um das 120 Hz Display handelt, fällt eigentlich nicht auf. Nur wenn man es mit diesem vergleicht, im normalen Gebrauch merkt man es nicht außer vielleicht beim Spielen eines Spiels. Ansonsten ist es wirklich sehr gut in der Verwendung, der Akku hält wirklich lange und auch die Kamera macht gute Fotos.Insgesamt finde ich das Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis deutlich besser gegenüber den pro Varianten.

Le téléphone est arrivé sans problème via le transporteur, un code est demandé pour garantir la livraison et la boîte est scellée.Je dirai juste que j'ai été surpris de ne pas trouver d'écouteur filaires, pour un tel prix ce serait le minimum sachant qu'Apple fait déjà pas mal d'économie sur le chargeur qui n'est pas fourni non plus.Il n'y a pas non plus de coque ni de protège écran...Le contenu de la boîte se résume au téléphone et au câble usb-c vers lightning. Pour un tel prix on pourrait s'attendre au minimum à avoir un protège écran basique et une coque, le temps d'acheter le nécessaire pour faire mieux.

10211,B0BDHR3MHB,5,"
Wie immer bei Apple, ein top gerät. Die preispolitik bezüglich des speichers ist zwar fragwürdig mit ca 400€ differenz zwischen 128GB und 1TB. Aber mir persönlich reichen 128GB in dem fall. Es ist kein schnäpchen und die arbeitsumstände sollen ja auch nicht die besten sein, doch das müssen die verantwortlichen in den griff bekommen.Im vergleich zu android läuft beim iphone alles flüssig und das gefällt mir.Wer auf ein paar spielereien wie die kameranotch und die kamera pro funktionen verzichten kann aber trotzdem die größe des pro max möchte macht hier nichts falsch. Wenns vom geld her geht. In schulden sollte sich keiner wegen einem smartphone stürzen nur um mithalten zu können. Auch sollte man vielleicht vorher das smartphone mal in der hand haben und das normale mit dem plus vergleichen. Das normale liegt top in der hand, das plus erfordert schon öfters mal beide hände. Somit könnte man sich eventuell paar hundert euro sparen und das normale mit 6,1 zoll nehmen. Es ist auf jedenfall ein unterschied der sich auch in der hosentasche bemerkbar macht.

"
10256,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
I bought this as I wanted a phone that was smaller and I am loving it apart from the battery being a little on the low side it more than makes up for it in how pristine the body is very fab phone.
"
10257,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
I've ordered a number of renewed iPhones. They are brilliant. By and large they are as described. But I've had a couple of issues. They just take them back, no quibbles, no issues, and issue a refund. So there's no risk.The first iPhone 12 we received had a column of defective pixels. Went straight back. The next arrived and in absolute mint condition, not a mark in sight, everything working as new, with a 92% battery health. Perfect.Seriously worth buying these considering the savings you make.
"
10258,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
I decided to return phone and get a more up to date one. That said the phone was excellent. I didn’t have it long enough to judge battery life etc. My money was returned promptly. I am very pleased and would buy from them again.
"
10259,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
I’ve never bought a refurbished phone before but will definitely do so again. The phone is in pristine condition with 98% battery health. Really pleased with this purchase

I bought a phone in excellent condition.  Back on the screen is scratched, which is very visible.  Front Screen without scratches.  The battery is 87%, which disappointed me a lot.  Also, the phone came without a charger and in the tiny box it looks like a letter.
"
10264,B08PCGL5TH,4,"
I bought this as a second phone for travelling and I almost can’t fault it. Perfect condition (true to description) no scratches, nicks, nothing at all so very happy about that. Everything seems perfect with it functionally so far and I’ll edit this if anything changes. Only thing is it seems like the battery dies faster than it should. It has 86% battery health but if I’m actively using it, it dies fast than my 80% XR. Not a drastic difference but noticeable. Still very good value for money!
"
10265,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
I was a bit sceptical when ordering a renewed phone but I have been very pleased with my purchase and would have no hesitation in recommending, the phone was advertised as excellent condition but I can honestly say it looks brand new.
"
10266,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Was umming and arring about buying a renewed phone online when you can’t see it beforehand but I decided to take a punt and see what happens and I’m glad I did. Phone was in mint condition no scratches or damage to the body or screen at all. Battery was 89% but that’s more than enough considering the price. If your debating buying I’d say it’s worth whatever risk is involved and if your not happy with the condition you can always send it back.
"
10267,B08PCGL5TH,3,"
So I paid £397 for a iPhone 12 in “excellent “ condition. I must admit I was a little nervous buying a second hand phone unseen as I had never done it before but it is a Christmas present for my son so went ahead. When I received it there is a very obvious long scratch down the centre of the face and several smaller scratches on face of phone. The battery life is 87%. I was going to return it but at this time of year did not want the hassle. I would not buy this kind of purchase online again I’m afraid. I took it into our local mobile shop who concurred it was not “excellent”
"
10268,B08PCGL5TH,4,"
Phone arrived quickly and was as described. However no charging lead and plug suitable for the phone (they had included a Samsung charger but we had purchased an iphone). Contacted amazon as was an amazon renewed product and they passed me to a 3rd party. I expect amazon to deal with amazon renewed product issues but alas not. 3rd party was pleasant and resolved issue quickly. Overall did take shine off the purchase somewhat though.

Ordered my Iphone 12 on Tuesday afternoon and crossed my fingers that the phone that arrived would be in good condition. Delivered on Wednesday evening and I can honestly say it's no different to a brand new Iphone. Not a mark on it and the battery health is at 90%To say I'm pleased with my purchase is and understatement. When you can get Iphones as pristine as this it makes no sense to pay near to or over £1000.00 for a new one!!I have no hesitation is recommending going down this route to anyone who, like me, wants a new phone but not the costs associated.Brilliant service!!

Battery life disappointing at 83% but phone overall pretty good.

Thank you so much guys, this phone is for a christmas present for my son and i am so happy that it looks so perfect

I bought my device from the Mazuma mobile. It came in a generic box with a generic usb-a cable and needle. No papers or original accessories. Device was functional.There were 2 issues with the device but they helped me for both:- The item was not the same as the description (there were some scratches). After my complaint, they ordered a small refund.- 2 months later, the phone's IMEI blacklisted and cellular network stopped. After my complaint, they said the issue is related with the previous customer of the phone. Reportedly they contacted with previous customer and blacklist removed.So, customer service was responsive. However, you should check everything and be a conscious customer.

Excellent condition just like brand new but cheaper price. Won’t ever buy new phone again
"
10283,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
The product was good enough as described in the specifications, maybe the cable could do better with a micro usb, but more importantly the phone is doing great, cheers :)

I had used iPhones since they were first released and loved them from day one. Last year I purchased a Samsung (great phones) but I never mastered the little differences in OS so took a chance on a refurbed iPhone 12. Best thing I've purchased in a while purchased via Amazon, came next day fab condition, couldn't fault it and I'm forensic. Great deal too boot.
"
10285,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Very cheap with vouchers

My phone is not working
"
10289,B08PCGL5TH,4,"
Overall a good quality other than a few scratches on the screen and the side’ overall a good product and  Would buy Buy another one if needed.could send in better packaging.
"
10290,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Arrived next working day. Packed really well. No scratches or marks. Looks pristine but only 88% battery life, I had hoped for more. Otherwise really pleased and pretty good value for money. Big improvement on my iPhone 6.
"
10291,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Brilliant could have been brand new
"
10292,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Great phone, good sized screen
"
10293,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Was packaged very well and in excellent condition.
"
10294,B08PCGL5TH,2,"
Phone looks great, came in what I thought was really good condition.Only use phone mostly for messaging partner and Google maps.Came to realise that the camera is useless. Can’t zoom in on anything very blurry. Doesn’t seem to focus properly, so can’t use video either.Not very impressed, wish I’d bought new.
"
10295,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Was scared it would be bad quality but it’s very good!!
"
10296,B08PCGL5TH,3,"
Phone arrived quickly but it had no fragile markers on the package and had been pushed through the letterbox onto a stone floor. Fortunately it didn't break.There are a lot of scratches on the screen for a product described in 'as new' condition, and a few chips to the body. The charge cable supplied is not Apple so time will tell how long it lasts. 88% battery health is a little lower than I'd have liked, though it shouldn't be an issue. The phone was not supplied in its original box and did not include any instructions or other information that would normally be supplied with a new phone. Otherwise the phone is fully functional and as desired.The voucher was a nice surprise too!
"
10297,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Item as described, no marks etc, good battery life.
"
10298,B08PCGL5TH,3,"
I know it’s a rendition phone but there were problems with it like the screen had a orange tinge on the side and when starting up there was a yellow bar across the top of the screen. That would have bugged me.
"
10299,B08PCGL5TH,4,"
This phone is lighter than my previous XR model, face recognition pretty good. Battery time is still a bit of downer for me as it runs out quick. Cable that came with it, was not particularly great as it is already broken. Overall a great phone, great specs , camera brilliant. Love this mint green colour.
"
10300,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Great product, value for money, nothing wrong with it, delivered really quickly too.
"
10301,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Is excellent Ian very happy
"
10302,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
iPhone 12 exactly as described. Had no scratches and everything worked as new. 98% battery health is really good. To my surprise I like the notch and haven’t missed Touch ID at all. Face ID works well.I preferred the telephoto and standard aspect on the iPhone 8 Plus to the normal and wide on this phone but the image quality is a step up again.I think my Apple Watch drains more quickly with this phone than the 8 Plus, but I do have an original Apple Watch, so that’s probably why.The box from loop mobile protected it well and had everything I needed in it. It may not be an original Apple box, but apart from the initial opening of it when does it matter?Arrived earlier than it said it would, I would look to order from Loop again, maybe a newer Apple Watch…
"
10303,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Just as good as new, no problems
"
10304,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Fantastic phone , looks brand new . A great purchase . Love it !!
"
10305,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Phone arrived early and packaged well not a scratch in sight looks like new really happy great job would recommend to anyone.
"
10306,B08PCGL5TH,4,"
My title says it all, how can a business be so unprofessional? There was no original box just a white cardboard box, and there was scratches everyone on the phone.
"
10307,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Very good value, almost as good as new, couple of very small scratches and battery 90%, but lot cheaper than new one, would recommend.
"
10308,B08PCGL5TH,2,"
Christmas present for my daughter. All seems to work ok, but definitely not excellent condition. Screen is cracked and lots of knocks evident around the camera with what appear to be chips on camera glass. Disappointed!
"
10309,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Bought renewed in excellent condition.Easy set up.  Great pictures.Highly recommended.Excellent service from seller.
"
10310,B08PCGL5TH,2,"
So, this 'excellent, no cosmetic damage visible from 30cm' condition phone didn't work out for me.  Didn't get as far as switching it on to comment on battery life etc.  Oh well, on to the next one.
"
10311,B08PCGL5TH,3,"
The product was good except for battery health. It was just 87% and the phone would heat up easily. The charger was not type c charger.
"
10312,B08PCGL5TH,2,"
Screen quickly scratched from the devastating onslaught of being in a soft empty pocket.  Back appears to be made of glass hewn from crystallised cheese.  My old SE lived 5 years without a scratch.  Bit cack really
"
10313,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
I was very worried about buying a secondhand/renewed iPhone, he has so many bad stories but I really couldn’t afford a brand-new one so I took a chance I was so so pleased the quality is fantastic it looks new the battery is 92% which is excellent lasts all day with use Spotify YouTube Facebook et cetera et cetera I am so happy with this product thank you Alison you still have not failed me
"
10314,B08PCGL5TH,2,"
Advertised as ""new"" but arrived with lots of marks and scratches to the screen.
"
10315,B08PCGL5TH,2,"
Very disappointed and pissed off. This was bought for a birthday present.. 18th. I felt so embarrassed when it didnt work proprely. As she needed it for college, I had to go out and buy another one in a local shop.
"
10316,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Very pleased indeed with the condition of this, considerably cheaper than new and other than a generic box and power adapter you’d never know it wasn’t new, excellent condition, unblemished screen and a battery health of nearly 90%  I wasn’t sure whether buying a “renewed” item was a good move but it’s been spot on
"
10317,B08PCGL5TH,4,"
Phone is just like new- really amazing quality, no bumps or scratches at all. My only concern is how hot it gets when using a few apps at a time, especially when using google maps or a similar app. I have to be very conscious to close all other running apps when using. Not sure if this is a general issue or not though!
"
10318,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Luckily covered Apple warranty for almost 8 months. Very good condition and happy with the purchase.Not got the Apple iPhone box, original charging cable. Phone is in great shape though with battery almost 100%.
"
10319,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
The Phone is in perfect working order and great condition

10320,B08PCGL5TH,2,"
Hidden damage means I can’t use it with an audio jack

Buying a second hand phone is always a bit of a risk if you don’t know the supplier. I am very pleased with the phone and would use the company again.
"
10322,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Really nice phone Excellent condition not a scratch on it like Brand-new would bye again from them. Value for money face recognition works fine battery life good thank you very much
"
10323,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Good no scratches and looks brand new. 88% battery life. Arrived quickly too
"
10324,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
4-5 teeny tiny marks on the top edge of the phone and a very very fine scratch on the back of maybe 2mm, but so small you need to be right up close, within a few centimetres of the phone really giving it a thorough examination. Rest of phone, including screen looks as new. Battery 99%. Came with what looks like an original apple plug and lightning cable (both usb, not usb-c) and sim ejector. All in all very pleased.
"
10325,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Five stars ⭐️
"
10326,B08PCGL5TH,1,"
I ordered an excellent condition iPhone which in the description states there will be no scratches on the screen. Upon receiving the item, the screen is covered in scratches with a few of them being long and deep. What’s the point in paying extra for excellent condition if it’s barely even ‘acceptable’ condition?
"
10327,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
IPhone arrived in 2 days , came in an unbranded box, sim tool & charger. Screen & body in excellent condition no marks or scratches with  battery health 95%.I used the phone for a week now so far I have not found an issue, I  tested playing video , photos, games and yes even phoned a friend. I not been able to test the wireless charging or Bluetooth earbuds with the phone.
"
10328,B08PCGL5TH,4,"
phone is good conditionI like the product
"
10329,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Was bought in error not realising it was renewed, seller very good and said they would accept return, phone  on arrival was great so my daughter decided to keep it.
"
10330,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Really pleased with my phone, looks brand new so glad I saved a bit of money by buying second hand with a years warranty included from a trusted Amazon seller. Delivery took a bit longer than expected but seems that was a Royal Mail error
"
10331,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Better than expected battery life not bad, but I use my phone a lot and I ask a lot from it and it don’t disappoints me.
"
10332,B08PCGL5TH,2,"
I bought one in ""excellent"" condition and got billed. This isn't in excellent condition. It is 89% battery and scratches all around the body. Screen is OK. Haven't tested further. Request immediate refund. Absolutely shame for ""Amazon quality"" selling this with misguided information.I can't believe Amazon has partner with this provider. My trust in Amazon brand has dip considerably. Think twice before you buy.Updated: you will need to pay for the return costs. Avoid this product please.
"
10333,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
If you have the money you are gonna B get better value b in the long. Run  buying an iPhone

"
10336,B08PCGL5TH,2,"
Camera outer cover visibly scratched
"
10337,B08PCGL5TH,1,"
Also the battery life is at 88%! I was not aware of that ?! After what I was charged for the phone I am so unhappy with the product ?
"
10338,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
The phone surpassed my expectations when it arrived. The phone was clean and such good quality, it was as if it was new. No visible scratches and 100% battery health. I also like the packaging! The phone has an amazing camera and great sound quality. Glad it came with a cable too! I’m really glad I bought from this company, rather than getting a new phone from Apple. I’m really happy and I would recommend the phone to anyone.
"
10339,B08PCGL5TH,1,"
Upon arrival the phone looked as good as new and had 100% battery life.  After transferring data across the phone had no service.  I checked the IMEI and found it to be blacklisted.  Although I asked for replacement a refund was sent (still waiting 3 days on), and prices to buy another phone had increased.  Third party seller was Mazuma.
"
10340,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Excellent condition and speedy service
"
10341,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Almost like new. All works okay other than the iOS can’t analyse the battery health due to an unknown battery part as the message states.
"
10342,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
A very good quality refurbished iPhone 12 mint condition arrived swiftly good value for money . Would purchase from them again.
"
10343,B08PCGL5TH,1,"
Described as ‘excellent’ condition but numerous nicks around the edges of the phone and the screen has clearly been inadequately replaced as it is bent.Do NOT buy from Loop mobile!

The phone was delivered quickly enough but I failed within 5 minutes of unboxing.Clearly the device had not been tested prior to dispatch.It’s wasted my time.
"
10361,B08PCGL5TH,1,"
Phone was badly damaged, scratches, dents visible from much more than 30cm. Old looking phone. Company takes days to respond back to you. Returned phone wanted me to wait another 5 days to see if had stock after waiting a week to get return label and for them to get the phone back.Awaiting refund off Amazon. Avoid at all costs. Purchased a mint phone off Apple which is refurbed, brand new battery and all coverings for 72 more. Full 12 warranty too with ApplePlease avoid, don’t make mistake I made. Selling rubbish, poor phones.

OMG this is a lot to spend on a reconditioned phone don’t they have any quality checking? This is the screen as it arrived. When bought it gave a 30 days money back guarantee but on the order it says we can only return by tomorrow which is the day the phone was supposed to arrive. Luckily it came a day early. On top of that the return address is completely illegible. Son is so disappointed as he spent he saved up for this.

Really annoyed to buy this and find that microphone not working. Took to apple store to run diagnostics and they told me phone had been already looked at by an apple store and same problem reported. Why can’t Phones Direct UK check before issuing ? Real hassle and now have to return.

I tried 3 different chips from 2 different brands and none of them worked.

I want no association with apple, this was a purchase on my account not for me.
"
10382,B08PCGL5TH,2,"
Was expecting something with better battery life. 90% suggests this phone is getting old. Apple recommend changing battery at 80% so it’s half way there.Minor scratch on screen.Not really bowled over, it’s cheaper than a new phone but only time will tell if it turns out to be an actual saving over a contract phone.
"
10383,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Great price. Phone has 100% battery health and only 1 micro scratch on the screen. Looks basically brand new :)
"
10384,B08PCGL5TH,1,"
Warning, proceed with caution.  The phone I received had a faulty microphone and clearly had not been checked.  Took a few weeks to receive the refund, so not worth the hassle really compared to buying new.
"
10385,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
I’ve had this phone for 5 months now I still haven’t seen an issue with it. It works like a brand new phone. I’m amazed.

10394,B08PCGL5TH,1,"
I owned a iPhone 11 and think it's time to upgrade to iPhone 12, but when I first received it was not impressed, after fully charges, a bit overheats and the camera is poor quality, my iPhone 11 better than these, so the next day I requested to return for full refund! I’m really disappointed in this product. getting a refund.
"
10395,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
This product was in perfect quality no scratches at all even when i looked very close and 100% battery life. I would recommend this product to anyone as it was good value and good quality.
"
10396,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Very good quality phone!
"
10397,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
I can't say enough about this phone, as, in the header, it is like a brand-new iPhone. The battery charges to a full 100%, which I find is a problem many people find buying from anywhere else, some only charge to 80%, but not mine. I haven't found anything yet that doesn't work as it should, I cannot praise this seller enough, it's a brilliant piece of kit.
"
10398,B08PCGL5TH,4,"
iPhone 12 reconditionné en parfait état. Le profit n’avais aucune rayure, on aurait dit un neuf. Mais après 3 mois d’utilisation je me suis rendu compte que je captais mal la 4 g et qu’elle était de mauvaise qualité. Aussi l’état de santé de ma batterie est passé de 100 a 90 % en 3 mois. La qualité chimique de la batterie m’as donc tout l’air d’être faible. Apart cela, très bon produit avec une super qualité.
"
10399,B08PCGL5TH,4,"
Lievi inestetismi sulla scocca posteriore a livello delle fotocamere e dei lati, qualche graffio impercettibile sul vetro frontale, ma nulla che non mi aspettassi. La batteria all’85% mi ha un po’ deluso peró bisogna ammettere che era stato specificato in descrizione che le batterie erano dall’85% in poi (pensa che sfiga proprio a me doveva capitare il requisito minimo). Ho pagato a rate Cofidis. Per il resto é tutto normale, nessun danno di sistema. Poteva essere incartato meglio e la puntina per accedere al vano sim non c’era.
"
10400,B08PCGL5TH,4,"
Sono rimasto soddisfatto dell’acquisto. Presenta segni di caduta e sfregamento solo intorno alle fotocamere, sennò sarebbe stato come nuovo esteticamente. Non sono uno che ne fa un grande uso di social o programmi che stressano la CPU, quindi la batteria al 90% non è un ostacolo per me, ma comunque sarà sufficiente per la maggior parte degli acquirenti.
"
10401,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Handy wie neu, nur gaaanz winzige Gebrauchsspuren - mit bloßen Auge nicht zu erkennen, Batterie 99%, Panzerglas, Ladegerät, Schnelle Lieferung, 100% zu empfehlen - WOW

L’iPhone est bien mais un soucis d’écran tactile et la batterie maximal 86% pourtant j’ai pris «très bonne état » mais caaVa
"
10403,B08PCGL5TH,4,"
Compre el teléfono en estado excelente. De aspecto está casi como nuevo, tan sólo tiene unas pequeñas marcas en el marco.Las pegas que veo son la salud de la batería que está al 85% y siendo de estado excelente me esperaba que estuviera algo mejor y por último, viene sin caja original y con un cargador y cable del chino…
"
10404,B08PCGL5TH,4,"
Ich hatte erst angst das ich schrott gekauft hab aber ich war echt überrascht das handy hat kein einzigen krazer und sieht toll aus leider ust dur akkukap. Bei 86%  und ust unverpackt nut in Folie angekommen alles in einem bin ich aber zufrieden
"
10405,B08PCGL5TH,4,"
Arrivato in tempi previsti.La batteria è al 99% vediamo nel tempo come si comporta , unica pecca un graffio sullo schermo che non rispecchia la descrizione di prodotto eccellente ( che prevede che non si vedono segni evidenti a meno di 30 cm di distanza ). Il resto sembra funzionare tutto a dovere . Non do 5 stelle per il graffio . In ogni caso consiglio l’acquisto

Bonjour j’ai reçu le portable 2 jours après la commande ça rien à dire, le téléphone a seulement des chtons en haut et en bas sur le cadre aluminium, état de la batterie à 96%, au bout de 3 jours elle est descendu à 95%, tout fonctionne pour l’instant parfaitement bien, livré avec chargeur complet mais qui n’est pas de chez Apple, une coque transparente de qualité médiocre et un verre trempé pareil de qualité médiocre, mais ça protège pour l’instant c’est le principal. Voilà

ich war sehr skeptisch, sehr ! Aber , ... ich wurde positiv überrascht ! Display top / Sauberkeit top, Funktion fehlerfrei / Batterie 85%, ich bin zufrieden bis ...  der Preis ist etwas zu hoch !
"
10408,B08PCGL5TH,4,"
complessivamente al momento sembra soddisfacente

Il telefono é arrivato prima dei tempi stabiliti (e di questo vi ringrazio) ho contattato il venditore per un problema di indirizzo ed é stato pronto nel darmi una corretta soluzione. iPhone è perfetto in tutte le sue funzioni e nell’estetica. Che dire soddisfattissima

All'inizio ero molto titubante vista la spesa da sostenere: comprare un rigenerato su internet oppure no?Vista la dipartita del mio precedente telefono mi sono deciso ed ho proceduto con l'acquisto.Sono molto soddisfatto.Il packaging dell'oggetto è veramente misero ma, a mio avviso, ininfluente ai fini della valutazione: ho comprato un telefono non la scatola che lo contiene.Per cui, vista la mia esperienza, vi consiglio il venditore.

Das Telefon hat als generalüberholtes Gerät ein sehr gutes Äußeres:- der Bildschirm ist makellos- Das Gehäuse hat einen winzigen Kratzer in einer Ecke, sonst fehlerfrei- technisch funktioniert alles wie bei einem NeugerätEinziges Manko:- die Batteriekapazität beträgt nur noch 80 %.Ein baugleiches anderes Gerät, was zwei Jahre im Dauerbetrieb ist, hat 88 %. Daraus schließe ich dass dieses Gerät mindestens drei Jahre alt sein dürfte.Wegen dieser 80 % max. Kapazität Bewerte ich das Gerät in Summe als „gut“ und mit vier Sternen.(Da 80 % für mich die akzeptable Grenze ist, habe ich das Gerät nicht umgetauscht.)

Telefono arrivato puntuale,ben imballato, dentro la confezione oltre alla presa e filo per caricare (la batteria dura tanto) anche una cover trasparente e la protezione vetro, i 2 graffietti sotto sono talmente piccoli che neanche si vedono.....buon acquisto lo consiglio

Il telefono si presenta in maniera quasi perfetta per quello sono contentissimo ma la durata della batteria è veramente scarsa per l’autonomia quindi sono piuttosto deluso per il prezzo che l’ho pagato. Mi aspettavo una batteria più fresca. Credo sarò costretto a farla sostituire… spero non a mie spese

Ho preso per la prima volta un iphone per provare un sistema diverso rispetto ad un android e l'ho trovo molto intuitivo, semplice e veloce. E' arrivato con un giorno di anticipo rispetto al previsto e apparte qualche ammaccatura leggera nei bordi della scocca del telefono ( cosa prevedibile in quanto comprato ricondizionato con dicitura buono e non eccellente) perfettamente funzionante, veloce e e in buone condizioni. Qualità prezzo ottimo, il più conveniente rispetto a tutti gli altri. Assolutamente soddisfatto dell'acquisto fatto!
"
10417,B08PCGL5TH,4,"
Spedizione molto veloce (nonostante non fosse Amazon), arrivato un giorno prima del previsto.Condizioni: eccellenti e ho notato un leggero e quasi impercettibile graffietto (davvero minuscolo) sulla parte bassa dello schermo e lo stato della batteria era dell’84% (e speravo di avere una percentuale più bassa, ma purtroppo no, su amazon le condizioni “Eccellenti” assicurano dall’80% dello stato della batteria in poi).Per il resto veramente tutto perfetto, é il mio primo iPhone e penso non sarà assolutamente l’ultimo e sono onestamente felice di aver abbandonato Android.Perché passare da Android ad iOS?- stabilità nel sistema- aggiornamenti precisi e che sicuramente copriranno il dispositivo per parecchi anni (di media 4).- applicazioni ed integrazioni perfettamente ottimizzate con il dispositivo- se ormai (come me) vi siete annoiati nello smanettare con un telefono e della personalizzazione totale ve ne frega poco allora questo potrebbe essere anche un altro motivo per passare ad iOS, ma attenzione, iOS permette tranquillamente una bella parte di personalizzazione ma sempre fino ad un certo punto.

Durée de vie de batterie à 85% autant dire que dans un an il faudra changer… déception mais rentre dans leur condition de vente 80% minimum. Mais déçu quand même !Par contre descriptif erronée, câble usb normal, alors que c’est indiqué usb-C à charge rapide.Vendeur pas très conciliant, au moindre soucis ou insatisfaction il faut renvoyer le produit… pas de solution. Alors que c’est une erreur de description de produit !

Spedizione tutto sommato nei tempi, considerando che il corriere era fedex. iPhone come nuovo salvo qualche lievissimo graffio, batteria al 100%, cavo Apple e caricatore originale inclusi.
"
10421,B08PCGL5TH,4,"
Ottimo prodotto. Il cellulare non ha neanche un graffio. L’ unica cosa che mi ha dispiaciuto un pó: un cellulare con lo stato “eccellente” dovrebbe avere uno stato di batterio superiore a 90%. (mi è arrivato con 85%) Peró, di sicuro mi prenderó un altro cellulare ricondizionato.
"
10422,B08PCGL5TH,4,"
Questo smartphone non ha bisogno di presentazioni, quindi non dirò nulla su aspetti tecnici o cose simili. Quello che è importante sottolineare, a mio avviso, è la qualità di un prodotto ricondizionato come questo che comunque richiede un esborso economico non indifferente per le tasche della maggior parte delle persone. Quindi il dubbio è sempre lo stesso: prendere un prodotto ricondizionato risparmiando qualche centinaia di euro o fare un ulteriore sforzo e prenderlo nuovo.Ho preso questo telefono per mia figlia quasi adolescente, era da tempo che voleva un iPhone, visto che quasi tutte le sue amiche ce l'hanno. Alla fine ho ceduto ma col patto di spendere al massimo una cifra intorno a 500 euro. Così è stato,  ho preso questo iPhone 12 ricondizionato a 555 euro. Il giudizio sul prodotto è assolutamente positivo. Il telefono è praticamente nuovo, non ha un minimo grasso, nessun difetto di assemblaggio, la batteria dura tranquillamente una giornata. Assolutamente nulla da dire.Il telefono arriva in una scatola non originale con cavo e caricabatteria non originale.Dopo un mesetto ho dovuto cambiare il cavetto in dotazione con un altro da 3A/20w.Consiglio l'acquisto di questo prodotto.

Acquistato ricondizionato ma l’articolo si presenta in perfette condizioni. No graffi, no ammaccature, schermo nuovo e no imperfezioni. Esattamente come nuovo.Ovviamente essendo però ricondizionato non arriva con scatola nuova ufficiale Apple, ma con una anonima del venditore. Non credo sia un problema!

10433,B08PCGL5TH,3,"
Ero molto neutro a comprare un telefono ricondizionato ma il prezzo mi ha convinto, l’ho comprato e devo dire che sono contento, batteria arrivata al 89% (buono secondo me, poteva essere di meno) e il telefono in uno stato praticamente perfetto, solo una piccola graffa nello speaker però neanche si vede se non lo sai. Il telefono è anche arrivato qualche giorno prima della data di consegna prevista, cosa molto positiva.L’unica cosa che direi come parte non molto positiva è il fatto che lo schermo non sembra di essere quello originale, e per questo non metto 4 stelle. Spunta un messaggio in impostazioni che dice ciò, però, come ho detto prima, per il prezzo sono soddisfatto perché comunque funziona perfettamente. Sinceramente lo comprerei di nuovo.

Para el uso que le doy (redes sociales, cámara, juegos) no tengo ninguna queja. Ni siquiera la batería está tan mal como pensaba (me vino al 85% de salud). Lo único es que tenía algunas mejores expectativas en la calidad de la cámara, por ejemplo a contraluz o a oscuras no me ha llegado a convencer, pero fuera de eso, si se tiene una buena iluminación realmente no tengo quejas, ninguna.

Prodotto arrivato una prima volta con un problema alla batteria, servizio clienti ottimo perchè me lo hanno ritirato e riparato in tempi brevissimi. Purtroppo però ho comprato un telefono in condizioni eccellenti (come da descrizione non dovrebbero esserci graffi visibili oltre i 30 cm) ma lo schermo presenta molti graffi nei bordi abbastanza visibili. Una stella in più perchè la batteria è al 100%.

 Ho acquistato questo Iphone 12 blu (128Gb) ricondizionato in condizioni ""eccellenti"" al prezzo di 660€. Le condizioni sono molto buone, ma è comunque presente un leggero segno sul pannello posteriore (come da foto) e lo schermo è perfetto (forse addirittura nuovo). La batteria risulta essere al 89% della capacità massima.Il prodotto ovviamente è ottimo, ma per condizione ""eccellenti"" mi sarei aspettato una batteria con capacità > 90% e nessun segno sul pannello posteriore (soprattutto considerando il costo pagato).Per questo motivo non do 5 stelle... Segnalo inoltre che nella confezione era addirittura presente un vetro protettivo e una cover trasparente (sorpresa molto gradita).Se ritieni utile questa recensione, sarebbe carino un pollice all'insù.Grazie

Comprato come usato in condizioni ""Eccellenti"" ma sono evidenti graffi sugli angoli superiori ben visibili, non ben pulito e batteria con poco più 80% di massima carica. Schermo integro con proteggi schermo già applicato. Per un telefono pagato circa il 25% meno di uno nuovo sorge il dubbio se ne è valsa la pena. La spedizione gestita come da aspettativa, ma confezione semplice con imballo protettivo un pò semplice. Ho acquistato da poco Phone usato da società tedesca che lo ha spedito in una confezione e packaging simile all'originale e in condizioni da quasi nuovo con lo stesso sconto. Ci sono ampi margini di miglioramento nella gestione dell'usato imparando da altri.

10449,B08PCGL5TH,3,"
Calidad precio es aceptable. Lo único malo es que lo compre en condición excelente y muestra arañazos a mas de 30cm de distancia, no al revés como decía la publicación ya que no tenia que verse ningún arañazo a mas de 30cm. Cumplieron lo de la batería, que su vida útil (capacidad) es mayor al 80%. La pantalla si me puso un poco a dudar ya que pienso que no esta bien ensamblada porque se puede apreciar que se sale del marco muy ligeramente y si le aplico un poco de presión se observa que se hunde un poco.De resto me funciona todo bien, cumplieron casi como estaba descrito en la publicación.Lo recomiendo si no quieren gastar mucho mas y si no les importa ciertas características quitando los rasguños puede valer la pena para algunos.Mirarlo bien!

Ya me hacia falta cambiarme de teléfono, y pensé en uno que sea calidad/precio como este IPhone. Reacondicionados es una lotería, pero a mi al menos este IPhone me ha salido en muy buen estado. A parte de que llevo buscando este IPhone hace tiempo porque me gusta bastante. En general muy alegre por la compra, ya que el teléfono únicamente me ha venido con un pico en un lateral que apenas se ve el pico ya que es pequeño. Y el porcentaje de la batería está a un 98% a si que bien, si baja rápido estos días lo comentaré.

Inizio dicendo che il prodotto mi è arrivato in ottime condizioni, non nella sua scatola originale ma in una targata ""loop"" con il cavetto originale e addirittura con un caricatore non originale ma nuovo, il prodotto ripeto si presenta molto bene, nessun graffio evidente e nessun tipo di danneggiamento vario, anche lo schermo risulta immacolato e ben tenuto, la batteria nel mio caso era al 99% ma devo segnalare che dopo nemmeno 3 mesi la percentuale è scesa al 95%, personalmente cerco di preservare il più possibile la batteria, ovvero non farlo scaricare oltre il 20% e non farlo caricare oltre 80% (sarà arrivato 5 volte al massimo al 100% e 5 volte sotto il 20% ma mai sotto il 15%, il dispositivo è sempre stato caricato con il caricatore originale della Apple da 20W, quindi valutate voi se è normale questo aspetto. Altra nota dolente è la fotocamera che da qualche giorno ha iniziato ad avere degli artefatti all'interno delle fotografie o video scattati in presenza di poca luce o con un fonte luminosa piazzata frontalmente, oltre a questi problemi devo dire che il telefono funziona davvero bene, nel caso il problema della batteria e della fotocamera dovessero divenire ancora più marcati valuterò se fare il reso. In fin dei conti direi un buon 7.5, magari sono stato sfortunato io.[AGGIORNAMENTO]Segnalo che da giugno la capacità della batteria è scesa fino al 90%, questo a mio parere denota che la batteria molto probabilmente è stata sostituita con una non performante o non originale.[AGGIORNAMENTO 2]Segnalo che la luminosità dello schermo in alcune situazioni diventa davvero bassa, nonostante la luminosità automatica sia disattivata e inoltre non si può alzare e questo comporta che sotto il sole non si veda assolutamente nulla, credo che questo problema sia dato da una sorta di surriscaldamento del dispositivo.Se hai trovato utile la mia recensione sarebbe bello se lasciassi un bel 👍

*Edito porque ha habido cambios en la bateria.La batería llegó con una salud del 97% y a los 11 días está al 95%. Lo cargo únicamente por la noche ya que me llega a final del día sin problema, pero me sorprende que esté bajando la salud tan rápido.Una de las lentes ha venido con varios arañazos, me lo han pulido y ya apenas se ven.Como curiosidad añadir que el iPhone es importado y no decía nada en la descripción, pero todavía no sé si eso podría afectar en algo actualmente o en un futuro en Europa, así que no sé si puede ser algo beneficioso o perjudicial.

C'est la première fois que cela m'arrive et j'en suis très déçu. Il y a eu un réel problème de communication entre Chronopost, la Poste et l'expéditeur sur le colis. Les informations n'étaient pas les mêmes pour chacun. Ce qui a fait que je me suis retrouvé avec un remboursement alors que j'avais bien reçu mon téléphone. Ce téléphone qui d'ailleurs était en parfait Etat comme je l'avais commandé. Aucunes rayures, qualité au top, et batterie à 100 !!! Mon téléphone faisait la journée complète et remplaçait l'ancien qui beug énormément. Mais que je dois reprendre aujourd'hui car je me retrouve contraint de rendre le téléphone acheté. Et pour ces gros problèmes de communication je suis déçu. J'ai acheté ce téléphone durant le black friday et je dois le racheter aujourd'hui, avec un prix plus conséquent... Ce qui est impossible pour un étudiant comme moi.

Arrivato in anticipo rispetto al previsto, solo leggermente graffiato nella parte bassa del device per il resto eprfetto.Batteria 85%.. tutti i pezzi sono originali, quindi sono soddisfatto.

Il telefono è arrivato sano, con tutte le parti funzionanti però si vede che non è pari al nuovo, nonostante io abbia scelto la categoria A, è arrivato graffiato ai lati della fotocamera e leggermente graffiato sulla parte finale del cellulare anche se non si nota molto.La batteria era dell'88% dunque tra un anno dovrei già cambiarla.Consiglio se non si vuole spendere molto ma tuttavia non vi aspettate chissà che.
"
10501,B08PCGL5TH,4,"
Il telefono è arrivato oggi rispetta la condizione eccellente il telefono è arrivato come nuovo, speravo nella batteria più del 90% mi è arrivato un 88% comunque vediamo nel tempo per ora tutto ok.

Se non sapessi che è stato ricondizionato, potrei credere che sia nuovo. Lo smartphone in pratica non ha un segno che possa farmi pensare che sia stato usato, anche la batteria dalla durata sembra nuovo. Consigliatissimo!!!
"
10511,B08PCGL5TH,3,"
Due scalfiture (di cui una abbastanza evidente; vedi foto) sulla scocca ed una percentuale di batteria già all’ 88% (per un telefono uscito 2 anni fa) non mi permettono di essere soddisfatto.

Buenas , comentar que el móvil lo compré porq ponía q estaba en condiciones excelentes y me a llegado con la pantalla rayada la parte d atrás también y la batería al 89%
"
10513,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
La batería con una salud del 89% y solo unos pequeños arañazos en la parte trasera, todo dentro de lo esperable al ser un producto reacondicionado. Llegó con cargador y una funda trasparente así como protector de pantalla.

J'achète un iPhone 12 blanc 128Go reconditionné avec la mention ""Excellent état"". On paie plus cher pour ça, et d'après les critères du vendeur : ""Corps : aucun signe de dommage cosmétique lorsqu'il est tenu à 30 centimètres de distance"". Sauf qu'on voir des tas d'impacts sur les anneaux de protection des obkectifs photo, même à 1m de distance !Également, des traces collantes (probablement laissées par une ancienne protection de mauvaise qualité) sont mal enlevées.Enfin, la batterie était usagée (capacité 79%, « à réparer » affiché sur le téléphone ) au lieu des plus de 80% garantis.Pour les traces, ça va encore, mais les anneaux abîmés, c'est clairement pas dans les critères ""Excellent état"" du vendeur 😡Je vais renvoyer cet article, et je changerai mon évaluation en fonction de ce qui se passe ensuite…

Ciao a tutti.Se volete un I phone propio adesso per un ottimo prezzo? Anche non dimentichiamo che questo cell e ricondizionato e funziona assolutamente perfetto. Ho pagato 600 Euro anziche 850 Euro. Non c'è paragone.Sono uguale ma il prezzo dà una stella in piùBravi braviSaluti

J’ai acheté cet IPhone 12 bleu 128 go, l’écran a visiblement été  changé car le joint du carter n’est pas bien positionné. Le principal problème est que le haut parleur du haut a commencé par grésiller et maintenant il ne fonctionne plus!!! Impossible d’entendre quoi que ce soit, impossible d’entendre un correspondant ni aucun son…Très déçu !!!Amazon ne me propose ni échange ni réparation seulement remboursement sachant que pour en acheter un nouveau cela me coûterait plus cher ! Incompréhensible sachant que le produit est garantie un an…
"
10528,B08PCGL5TH,2,"
L’iPhone était défectueux (flash ne fonctionnant pas), et la coque comportait de sérieuses rayures, pas compatibles avec un appareil reconditionné censé avoir été contrôlé.Au moins après retour j’ai été remboursé vite et sans problème.

La vida de la batería estaba al 87%, en lugar del 90% que mencionaban.Además venía sin adaptador de corriente, lo cual se solucionó con un pequeño reembolso que no cubría el valor del mismo.Por lo menos las respuestas del proveedor son ágiles.

Ne ho comprati due uno bianco è uno nero (il bianco ha dei graffi) arrivati senza scatola chiusi in una busta delle lettere, cavetto troppo grosso per caricarli devo levare la cover!  comprati a marzo a distanza di 4 mesi la batteria è scesa a 96% e il nero devo ricaricarlo più volte al giorno si scarica velocemente! Batteria non affidabile per niente ho chiesto il reso meglio comprare un prodotto nuovo.

Acquistato Iphone 12 128 gb il 22 Novembre, prezzo molto competitivo per un dispositivo in condizioni ""eccellenti"" che poi si è rivelato tutto il contrario. Il dispositivo infatti presentava ammaccature molto visibili sulla scocca da oltre 30 cm di distanza (al contrario di quanto scritto sul sito) e lo schermo presentava dei graffi ben visibili anche senza tenere il dispositivo controluce. Inoltre presa lightning e altoparlante frontale sporchi con presenza di polvere, non il massimo per un dispositivo che dovrebbe essere testato e ripulito.Nemmeno configurato, effettuerò il reso. Spero sia stato solo un caso perchè il prezzo era ottimo e la spedizione sempre al top su amazon.

Titubante all’inizio , ma appena aperta la confezione sono rimasto piacevolmente colpito , telefono perfetto , solo un piccolo graffio sulla scocca superiore, display perfetto (era l’unica cosa che mi preoccupava). Spedizione 2gg , costo 619€ ottobre 2022. Consiglio!

J’avais le 11pro avant celui-ci autant vous dire qu’il n’a rien à envier au 12, la qualité photo est médiocre on dirait les anciens téléphones portables et la batterie quelle horreur je dois le charger au moins 2 fois dans la journée et la nuit il finit quand même par s’éteindre

Compre el producto aproximadamente el 5 de agosto en estado excelente, a dia de hoy, 28 de noviembre ha bajado un 7% la salud de la bateria (Ya vieniendo con algunas marcas de uso y un 94% de salud), algo bastante raro que baje tan rapido no dandole mucho uso dia a dia (llego al final del dia con aprox un 45% y lo pongo a cargar con el cargador proporcionado, supuestamente compatible, y no dejandolo por la noche), hoy me encontrado con la sorpresa de que casi se podria haber quemado el escritorio porque el cable proporcionado (supuestamente, certificado por MFi) a empezado a echar humo.Aparte de todo esto, el movil es la versión de EEUU (a2172), que no deberia ser un problema en cuanto a las bandas, aunque el 5G no ha funcionado correctamente (teniendo antena cerca de casa y comprobado con la misma SIM en un movil 5G [Mi10T] ).En cuanto al resto, vino bien empaquetado, sin la caja original (no es problema).Se pide la devolución, ya que no termino de fiarme de que el terminal este en buen estado o no el indicado despues de haber pasado un tiempo de prueba bastante extenso.

Pessima esperienza: ho acquistato due iPhone 12 in condizioni ""eccellenti"" che mi sono pervenuti con schermi non originali e di cattiva qualità, nonostante la descrizione dell'oggetto parli solo della possibilità di accessori (e non componenti) non originali - problema non da poco dato il prezzo pagato. Una volta contattato, il venditore non sembra aver dato alcuna importanza al problema.
"
10543,B08PCGL5TH,3,"
Inizio col dire che è un ricondizionato a metà e questo perché è indecente avere un telefono che è stato testato e rimesso a nuovo ma con un auricolare gracchiante. Impossible fare telefonate se non con l'auricolare e poi gli audio di WhatsApp a volte manco si sentono bisogna riavviare l'App. Oltretutto il telefono scalda in una maniera allucinante soprattutto quando si ricarica in wireless. Meno male che c'è la garanzia Amazon renewed perché farò sicuramente il reso

10548,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
niente da dire sull’ iphone, arrivato con una batteria pari al 89%. le condizioni eccellenti si son viste, non ho notato nessun segno che mi facesse pensare fosse già stato usato, sembrava veramente nuovo
"
10549,B08PCGL5TH,2,"
Lo smartphone si presentava in ottimo stato pari al nuovo venduto come ricondizionato eccellente solo che hanno usato dei ricambi non originali ( display )Apple che oltre a far perdere valore allo smartphone non assicurano la durata di esso..spedizione veloce chiesto immediatamente il reso
"
10550,B08PCGL5TH,3,"
Il telefono mi è arrivato con un graffio sulla fotocamera posteriore ,mentre quella anteriore anche se la pulisco mi trasmette l’immagine sempre e comunque sfocata sul display ,apparte questi due problemi che mi infastidiscono il telefono è praticamente quasi  nuovo peccato che in oltre dopo un po’ di giorni che lo sto usando ho notato che una cassa audio non va e l’hot spot non si può attivare per via di Danni tecnici
"
10551,B08PCGL5TH,1,"
Telefono arrivato in anticipo, tutto perfetto fino all'accensione. Ho notato subito che la cornice nera era stranamente spessa (più del mio iPhone 12 originale) e che il lato inferiore era addirittura più spesso degli altri, decentrando così l'immagine. Allora con il dubbio che si trattasse di un ricambio ho guardato più attentamente e ho visto che la nitidezza delle scritte era decisamente peggiore. Finita la configurazione ho avuto la conferma nelle impostazioni dove è riportato che lo schermo è una parte sconosciuta, probabilmente non originale.Capisco la necessità di ricondizionare telefoni con schermi danneggiati, ma mi metti un display cinese sgranato e lo spacci anche per A+?State attenti ai dettagli.

Nunca había comprado un teléfono reacondicionado pero la verdad es que me he llevado una grata sorpresa . El móvil está impoluto, funciona a la perfección y tiene una vida útil de batería por encima de 90% . Visto esta experiencia creo que en futuras adquisiciones volveré a probar con los reacondicionados .

10559,B08PCGL5TH,1,"
Nel giro di pochi mesi il telefono ha iniziato ad avere degli spegnimenti improvvisi e alla riaccensione il livello della batteria era cambiato dal 90 al 20% , mai una caduta , sempre trattato con perizia , gli ultimi giorni ha smesso di ricevere la carica e restava acceso al 1% solo se collegato , ma senza andare oltre quella percentuale  . Sulle impostazioni messaggio di errore che avvisa che la batteria non è originale e forse proprio per questo è durata così poco , assurdo per un telefono pagato 640 euro e tra l’altroregalato . Chiesto reso e oltre il danno la beffa perché dovrò restare una settimana o forse più senza telefono perché avrò rimborso solo dopo che il venditore riceverà l’oggetto.
"
10560,B08PCGL5TH,1,"
eigentlich sollte ich ein Foto mit einstellen. Das Gerät habe ich jedoch dirket wieder verpackt und retourniert. Dieses Gerät als ""ausgezeichnet"" für 550 Euro zu verkaufen ist eine bodenlose Frechtheit. Das Gerät hat noch nie eine Schutzfolie gesehen, außerdem ist der Vorbesitzter wohl mit einer Ecke an einer Hauswand entlang geschlittert oder es viel aus entsprechender Höhe auf den Asphalt. Total abgeranzt. Sowas hab ich noch nie geschafft mit meinen Smartphones, welche mal gestürzt sind.Dass Amazon für sowas seinen/ihren Namen hinhält ist kaum zu glauben. Ich habe kein Neugerät erwartet aber das Teil gehört eigentlich entsorgt. Unglaublich, unterirdisch, für dumm verkauft oder inkompetente Mitarbeiter. Nie wieder generalüberholt.
"
10561,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Venditore raccomandato! Il telefono (acquistato in condizionino eccellenti) sembra a tutti gli effetti nuovo, ad eccezione della batteria 89%,comunque dura tutta la giornata se lo si usa normalmente.Pare funzioni tutto alla perfezione , in caso aggiornerò la recensione
"
10562,B08PCGL5TH,2,"
il telefono è arrivato 2 settimane prima della data prevista, quindi il venditore è stato davvero efficiente; peccato che abbia dovuto restituirlo perchè l'audio all'orecchio e in vivavoce era basso, non regolabile e disturbato. ok invece quello in cuffia. Il telefono dal punto di vista estetico era in condizione perfette
"
10563,B08PCGL5TH,3,"
Wir hatten es so gelesen das ein neuer Akku oder zumindest einigermaßen funktionierender Drinne eingebaut is aber der hatte nur noch 60% funktionsleistung sonst topp

Il telefono è arrivato in condizioni buone, presenta alcuni segni di usura ma essendo ricondizionato ci può stare.
"
10565,B08PCGL5TH,1,"
Telefono arrivato con bordi ammaccati ma lievemente, schermo non compatibile con il dispositivo, surriscaldamento estremo della batteria (non usabile per più di 5min) andava a fuoco, cristalli liquidi scadenti, microfono mal funzionante. Tutto questo risolvibile, ma venditore mi ha accusato mi aver fatto danni, quando io ho inviato subito foto e prove subito all’arrivo del telefono. Scortese e maleducati. Per me non sono dei venditori terzi a cui affidarsi. Avevo chiesto aiuto a loro e mi hanno detto di aspettare 14 gg, così da farmi perdere la garanzia A-Z Amazon. Per fortuna non ho aspettato e sono stato rimborsato. Amazon affidabile. LOMBARDO SHOP VERAMENTE EVITABILE
"
10566,B08PCGL5TH,5,"
Prodotto arrivato in anticipo, non nella scatola originale di iPhone ma in una scatola del venditore, senza auricolari ne alimentatore (per non è un problema perché avevo già un iPhone e userò quelli), ma il telefono è in ottime condizioni, non ha un graffio sembra nuovo. Se vogliamo trovare un difetto la batteria è al 90% ma essendo ricondizionato ci sta. Venditore consigliato, perché ho letto  recensioni dello stesso prodotto ma di altri venditori e quasi tutti si lamentavano di segni di usura.

El móvil que recibí estaba impoluto por fuera, únicamente tenía unas marcas en el cristal mínimas. Lo único que tuve que devolverlo debido a que se reiniciaba constantemente y había momentos que se quedaba la pantalla en negro y no encendía. El servicio postventa no me dio ninguna opción a la hora de comentárselo y que me mandaran otro y hacerme otro tipo de compensación, me dijeron mándalo y te reembolsamos el dinero, lo que demuestra dejadez por su parte y poco buen trato hacia el cliente. Por esto le pongo una estrella.

10594,B08PCGL5TH,1,"
La batterie est à 87% de sa capacité originale, le bouton pour mettre le telephone en silencieux est abimé, l'écran du téléphone reste noir durant les appels, et ce jusqu'a ce que votre interlocuteur raccroche, la peinture est écaillé à plein d'endroit, ce n'est pas un téléphone reconditionné c'est un téléphone d'occasion.

Ricevuto iphone ricondizionato  in tempi rapidi, come al solito con Amazon, caratteristiche esterne apparentemente buone. Dopo le (lunghe) procedure di installazione e configurazione scopro che l'auricolare del cell non funziona e non si sente nulla!!! Con un po' di rabbia penso: può capitare... cerco le politiche di reso e scopro che devo fare il reso A MIE SPESE!!!!! Quindi devo perdere del tempo ad andare in posta e buttare dei soldi per restituire una cosa che non va!NO, ATTENZIONE AL MARKETPLACE ED A QUESTO VENDITORE IN PARTICOLARE CHE ADOTTA QUESTA POLITICA SCORRETTA.

Venditore scorretto!Ho preso un Iphone12 ricondizionato (in ottime condizioni estetiche) ma dopo nemmeno un mese ha smesso di funzionare senza apparenti motivi, senza subire ne cadute ne urti.Amazon mi ha autorizzato il reso per garanzia ma l'assistenza del fornitore rifiuta il rimborso o sostituzione perchè nella cover mi ci è venuto un graffio. E per un graffio mi invalidi la garanzia di questo grave malfunzionamento?  Intanto il cellulare non funziona più.Roba da vergognarsi! Venditore sconsigliato!

Telefono pieno di graffi sulle fotocamere, ammaccature sul bordo del telefono e memoria al 90% e considerato che ho acquistato il telefono allo stato eccellente mi è impossibile accettare questi compromessi.Ho fatto il reso e cosa peggiore in tutto questo è che in 5 giorni che l'ho fatto non hanno ancora controllato in che stato si trova(l'ho usato letteralmente 5min) e non mi hanno ancora fatto il reso.Servizio clienti imbarazzante!

Acheté en ""Excellent état"", pour rappel Amazon annonce comme critères :""Écran : aucune rayure, Corps : aucun signe de dommage cosmétique lorsqu'il est tenu à 30 centimètres de distance.""Le téléphone présente pourtant une rayure bien visible sur l'écran et la peinture autour des deux objectifs photo est écaillée. Les deux défauts sont visible au premier coup d'oeil donc le vendeur est soit incompétent soit malhonnête, aux choix.Pour ce qui est de la batterie je ne peux pas me prononcer. Je ne suis pas allé jusqu'à l'allumer, il est retourné directement dans sa boite.En attente de remboursement.

Abbiamo ordinato un telefono nero ed è arrivato blu ma siccome era urgente (abbiamo pagato anche la spedizione) poichè mia figlia studia fuori città ed era senza telefono, lo abbiamo tenuto, comprando una cover nera;-). Dopo 20 giorni non riconosce più la SIM (che provata nel mio telefono funziona). Abbiamo chiesto la sostituzione, speriamo siano rapidi (mia figlia è a casa una settimana) e che stavolta.. funzioni. È vero che è rigenerato ma costa quasi come nuovo. Peccato, la telecamera è valida e per 3 settimane è stato un buon telefono.

En mi caso, el teléfono vino con la cámara delantera estropeada. Por fuer atenía algún rasguño pero no pude ni iniciarlo xq no me funcionaba el reconocimiento facial. Lo devolveré en lo que pueda, estoy esperando que me conteste el vendedor.

El teléfono llegó en aparente buen estado. La pantalla estaba cambiada, pero al ser reacondicionado, es algo comprensible. Sin embargo, a la semana de usarlo, falló el Face ID y he tenido que devolverlo. Tal y como he leído en otros comentarios, quizá deberían revisar algo mejor los teléfonos reacondicionados antes de venderlos, pues es una auténtica lotería. El servicio de logística por parte de Amazon para la devolución y resolver dudas, inmejorable. Me acabo de comprar uno nuevo para no llevarme más sustos. XD

Non capisco perché mi è stata cancellata la precedente recensione.Quindi la riscrivo: l'iPhone 12 verde vednuto da RG RENT è tutto graffiato con un graffio importante sulla fotocamera anteriore/face ID. A volte nn riconosce il FaceID e se metto una pellicola il FACE ID non viene proprio riconosciuto e quindi sono costretto ad usare il codice di sblocco o a rimuovere la pellicola!L'ho comprato perché c'era la dicitura: condizioni eccellenti. Non chiedevo un iPhone nuovo di zecca, ma almeno uno con pochi graffi e un pò più nuovo. Ho gia richiesto il reso. Lo comprerò da un altro venditore

Ho scritto al venditore ancora senza risposta, l’iPhone che ho ricevuto ieri pomeriggio ha il frame in alluminio con profonde ammaccature e graffi, il che è molto lontano dalla descrizione “nessun segno di imperfezione a distanza di 30cm”, sono segni visibili anche a 1m (purtroppo). In queste condizioni un iPhone nuovo scontato è un’opzione più dignitosa.

Rapporto qualità prezzo direi basso/molto basso, si paga un iPhone ricondizionato 100€ in meno rispetto al nuovo e ti arriva con la scocca rovinata su tutti gli angoli, lo schermo è ok, ma sinceramente mi aspettavo molto di meglio.Mi ritengo deluso dall’acquisto, e consiglio di non fidarsi troppo della descrizione del prodotto “difetti estetici non visibili da 1 metro” mi sembra un po’ una presa in giro, i difetti si vedono, da ben più di 1 metro

Ich hatte mich sehr auf das Handy gefreut und konnte kaum auf die Lieferung warten.Ich bin zutiefst enttäuscht gewesen als ich die grüne elektrische Linie am Display sah. 😲Ich meine das Handy kostet gerade nicht wenig und man hätte sich bisschen Mühe bei der Überprüfung des Handys und der Verpackung geben können.Bevor das Handy ankam habe ich das passende Panzerglas und die passende Hülle gekauft was mir etwa 40€ gekostet habe, und selbst die haben mich mehr Freude gemacht als das Handy.Nun habe ich das Vertrauen verloren und leider nicht zu empfehlen.🥲

Even though I bought this through Amazons' Warehouse, the iPhone had little to no dents or scratches apart from a slight scratch at the top antenna area (doesn't matter since everyone including me rocks these phones with a case). A great phone just like it's predecessors.
"
10727,B08L5QPJNW,4,"
There's no doubt that this is a really good phone, and I'm lucky to have it. It was a compromise though - I wanted the third lens on the camera because I take a lot of pictures, but would honestly have preferred the iPhone 12 Mini for size - screens are so good these days they really don't need to be huge. So I knew what I was getting. Upgrading from the 64Gb on my old phone to 256Gb is great, although it still filled up immediately until I changed the settings back to optimising photo storage. At least now I've got enough room not to worry about apps and so on. There are some things I preferred about the older generation of phones but we're never going back, and quite a few things that are still better with Android (price for one), but I can't really imagine anyone ever being disappointed with this as a choice.
"
10728,B08L5QPJNW,5,"
More than happy with my phone. Big memory. Takes great clear photos. Fits nicely in my handbag. Lots of recording space for voice memos. Very secure with face recognition. Lots of useful apps and games. This from the women who is not techno savvy. It goes everywhere with me. I’ve saved a fortune on sat nav for the car. I just downloaded a Waze app and I’m off! Battery lasts long and charges quickly. Definitely would recommend. My daughter bought hers after mine because she was impressed with it and she is very tech savvy!
"
10729,B08L5QPJNW,4,"
Not much to say
"
10730,B08L5QPJNW,5,"
The 12 Pro is the best iPhone ever produced. It’s a massive improvement over previous iPhones and the camera is breathtaking! Night time photography brings out a whole new world of possibilities. Difficult to believe but two of the pics I have posted were taken in the dark, the third is a portrait pic of my Jug Lola. I just don’t know how Apple manage to do this in such a small package but it’s amazing. Then I discovered the Lidar camera....OMG! It has to be seen to be believed. Yes, it is pricey but I’ve been a huge fan of Apple phones and this one does not disappoint. You may want to wait for the Pro Max but that will be more expensive and way bigger.
"
10731,B08L5QPJNW,5,"
Great phone but the camera is superb . Thought good and hard about buying due to the cost but was sold on it after one day of using the camera. I’m a keen photographer but didn’t want to carry camera everywhere. Using this more than my camera .Great zoom and video too.
"
10732,B08L5QPJNW,5,"
I upgraded from my iPhone X to get the 5G capability. I went for the Pro version because really my phone has replaced my camera now and the iPhone 12 Pro has a very good camera with a much better low light capability.Performance-wise I haven't noticed any big advantage over the iPhone X, although I don't play games or anything that would require a particularly fast processor.I noticed that the handy auto-lock feature has been removed. On my previous iPhone, closing the folio case would lock the phone and, similarly, opening it would unlock it again. A useful feature that I miss.it's a well made Apple phone and I have no hesitation in recommending it.
"
10733,B08L5QPJNW,4,"
Decent phone, well made and easy OS to use. Came from Android but I’m a techie so no issue getting used to new phone.Price is a little high since you can get most of these feature on different phones, but you won’t be disappointed in buying this phone. If you’re unsure between iPhone 12 or 12 Pro. I’d recommend just getting the iPhone 12 not much in them just pro get extra telephoto lens.
"
10734,B08L5QPJNW,5,"
I love the pacific blue colour, looks so much better in real life than on pictures.  Amazing camera, so much better than my previous iPhone X. Night mode is great. However, due to pandemic and travel restrictions I cannot yet use the phone to it’s potential. The screen is stunning, however I’m still getting used to the slight size difference. Battery is good but not great. Personally I would have gone for iPhone 12 Pro Max but the size is off putting. I would give 4,5 out of 5 stars because of the battery. The phone lasts through the day when using it for emails from morning till evening. Streaming is another question...
"
10735,B08L5QPJNW,5,"
This phone is your typical iPhone with some extra features. In all, very nice. Upgraded it from my 11 pro. The speakers are much better so it’s nicer to listen to music without putting your headphones. In  general, everything is similar to the previous phone but it does have some nice new features.
"

I love the design and feel of the phone. It reminds me of my iPhone 4. I’m not a fan of apples iOS system, I prefer googles stock android operating system. Unfortunately google design is lacking so I went for the iPhone 12pro, I didn’t want the Max version as it to big for comfort in the pocket.I definitely prefer this design over the X and XS.I was really pleased with the option to buy over 5 instalments. Amazon make it too easy to buy.

I bought the phone hoping it would be a very good upgrade in comparison from my current 11 pro, however after trying my friends iPhone 12 pro and not being overly amazed with the new features I decided to make a return as I feel its not worth the upgrade. If you are upgrading from an iPhone x or below, I would say that its worth it, however from an 11 or 11 pro its not worth it after trying out my friends iPhone 12 pro.

10738,B08L5QPJNW,5,"
Amazon had it priced £250 lower than Apple so had to give it a go. Been using for ~1 week now. Can’t fault it apart from battery not being the best imo. The same usual comfort straight out of the box with iOS. The plug not being in the box wasn’t an issue. Flat edged are back and damn they feel nice.  If you love the comfort of iOS and haven’t upgraded in a while then this should be the phone for you

Upgraded from the 7 plus. I was really excited to get the new iPhone as I’ve wanted to upgrade for a while but put off by the price tag. First impression was “oh, that’s it” I expected it to be bigger. It was smaller than my 7 plus, looked more square like an old IPhone 4 but heavier. Straight away, the first thing I noticed was how yellow the screen was so I turned off the auto brightness and messed with a few other setting but was still annoyed by how yellow and dull it looked. I tried taking the same photos with the 12 pro and my 7 plus and actually preferred the colour and quality of my old phone’s photos. I even emailed myself the photos to have on the device to ensure it wasn’t just the yellowness of the screen that made them look bad and it wasn’t. Not impressed at all and not worth the money so I have returned my first ever iPhone.

I recently wanted to purchase a new phone due to my current IPhone 7 slowing down and freezing. This new purchase of the IPhone 12 Pro has been absoultely incredible and I’m so glad I waited for this model.- fast speed- insane quality, pics etc- great battery lifeI would highly recommend! Apple has done it again - thank you so much ❤️

I'm not sure any phone is worth a grand. It was for my daughter and I'm reliably informed that it's a darn fine phone. However, long live Android!
"
10742,B08L5QPJNW,5,"
Among this year’s iPhones. Perhaps the pro is the least “pro” one. The regular 12 is just as good in all key aspects including screen and camera, which divided the 2 models last year. However this doesn’t mean the pro is not worth the extra, apple has clearly put more thoughts in the colour and material. Still love it! Btw the max is just huge.
"
10743,B08L5QPJNW,5,"
I love iPhones and don’t mind paying the price. I could have gone for the cheaper 12 but wanted the 12 Pro. Facial recognition is great and saves a lot of time. The battery life on this 12 Pro seems much better than my previous 8 but battery life does erode with time. I love this phone.

Great phone that really is a improvement on my old iPhone se2020. I have had this for 2 months and I’m quite happy.However I am not impressed with the amount of times I have to turn this phone off to re-boot because everything freezes.Everything else in the house works fine with my WiFi.This is also the situation when I am out and about.I have a full signal but am constantly having to turn the phone off for a few minutes and then on again.I never had to do that with my old iPhone se 2020 .Not worth the money in my opinion.Update. 19-8-2021Phone still freezes. iOS is up to date. My iPad Pro 9.7 (a few years old now)  never seems to have a problem when I am home, this phone does. beginning to wonder if it is a faulty phone. next stop is to go to a apple store and see if there is anything they can do, but as things are im not impressed. i need to reboot once a day.watch this space.Update. Totally useless constantly. Regularly freezes and fails to connect to the WiFi. I thought this may be my router but the other items all connect without a problem. Waste of money. Avoid
"
10747,B08L5QPJNW,4,"
The only problem would be the iPhone box itself was dented. There were however no issues with the phone. I ordered another iPhone with this one which never came but that's an entirely different issue.
"
10748,B08L5QPJNW,5,"
Love the phone, upgraded from an X. Still overpriced in my opinion. The battery life is not markedly different from my old X. Interesting to see if it maintains the level of battery capacity over the next years.
"
10749,B08L5QPJNW,3,"
You can't deny, apple really do provide a premium product and hands down win against Samsung when compared to over all finish however when using this I couldn't help but think that my previous phone was better. This resulted in sending the phone back and sticking with my Samsung s20 ultra. I don't think I could get over the huge camera notch and the refresh rate on the display was just not amazing. I'll probably return to apple when these issues are resolved.
"
10750,B08L5QPJNW,5,"
Fantastic phone (as expected!!)... feels like the old 5C generation phone to hold, only heavier... so not as comfortable in hand as my XR but the camera quality is spot on which is what I wanted the pro for. Good value as I bought from Amazon Warehouse so saved £160 off retail price.

It’s a simply brilliant  phone, the best so far. I had a 3G, 4S, 6+, 7+, X, SE2, and this is miles ahead of them all in so many ways. The triple camera takes stunning photos and it’s a powerful device in every other respect, never mind it looks stunning.

As an apple sheep after watching the October event I was excitedly waiting till this iPhone could come back in stock.I even had to cancel my previous order as I was told by Amazon customer services that it would take at least 1-2 months to arrive! What a disappointment.Even worse so, when I ordered this iPhone once it came back in stock it arrived with faults! I can’t use the network capabilities on the phone and use a sim thus I am going to return this device ASAP. This might be a one-off unit but beware of defective units.

Apple is an expert at spinning phones from functional machines into desirable, aesthetically-honed status symbols, and the iPhone 12 Pro is a prime example of a device you probably don’t need but will definitely want.The front of the phone is covered in what Apple calls “Ceramic Shield,” a hybrid of glass and ceramic. Between the new material — you can’t call it “glass” because it’s technically not glass — and the new design, Apple claims the iPhone 12 line has four times better drop performance than the previous models, with the same scratch resistance. (I drop my phone a lot, so I’m excited to see how this goes.) On the back, you’ll find the same type of glass as last year, but the new design should improve its drop performance as well,Apple says.One thing Apple would not tell me is how resistant this stainless steel frame is to nicks and scratches…The main camera has a very slightly brighter lens than last year, which helps it in low light, and Apple’s new Smart HDR 3 processing seems to be, well, a little smarter. The noise reduction is improved and looks better than the iPhone 11: photos look less grainy, and there’s a little more detail. The photos are also slightly more contrasty; every year, Apple seems to be more willing to let highlights be highlights and shadows be shadows, which is a look I’m personally fond of.The back of the phone features Apple’s new MagSafe magnetic wireless charging and mount system, which feels like the connector equivalent of the summer before college for the first time: the future is bright and exciting, and you get to reinvent your whole situation from scratch. But the days of the Lightning connector are obviously coming to a close, and it’s okay to be sad about it.MagSafe is extremely clever as a concept and exceedingly fine in reality. I am excited about magnetic car mounts and stabilizer gimbals and other accessories that don’t require fiddling to attach.

After befriending various power outlets around the house with my iPhone 7, I decided to upgrade to this.It’s good, the cameras good and it makes calls.It’s heavy, it has that annoying paint on the frame you know full well that after a few blurry nights will scratch up nicely..... as you don’t get a charger get a decent wall charger and the wireless apple charger.... £35 was the cheapest I found.If like me you have watched your phone bounce off the ground a few times you will want a case and a screen thingie, it weighs the same as a small ship so a car should offer the ground some protection.5G is alive and well in there too, but that’s the network people not this shiney brick tbh.The camera’s are the reason you got here ( or you realised the S20 is not the same as the US version you see in the adds) it’s good, it’s very good... I can often be found out and about with a bag full of lenses and my DSLR, or with a 8k camera precariously stuck to my drone, so can happy Saturday as an ‘all the kit and no clue’ brigade it’s pretty amazing.Battery appears to be in there too, lasts ages so could possibly be magic of some kind.Safety is something I’m glad to say Apple has built in to this new device. Your £1200 looks mighty pretty to some undesirable types, but now you can simple batter then with this metal brick. Nice one you wonderful greengrocers.Ts waterproof ish, they say 6m however they fail to explain how you are meant to have a call at that depth, this could prove disastrous if tried. Besides if you’re diving and still need to answer calls, then perhaps  it’s time to reevaluate your life work balance.It has a torchlight, it reminds me of this often with a nice blinding light when my fat fingers press the wrong bit, that or it hates me.Sadly on the down side, none of my pets have yet to add teeth marks yet. As such I’d say this device makes a rubbish rabbit toy

I have purchased iPhones since the first model. This is a great phone but the battery life compared to my last iPhone 11 Pro is shockingly bad. I was getting 2 days from my 11 Pro, but barely get a day from this new 12 Pro, and I'm not a gamer either. Just be warned.
"
10818,B08L5QPJNW,5,"
It’s an amazing phone, these are some of its quality:- 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display;- Ceramic Shield, tougher than any smartphone glass;- A14 Bionic chip, the fastest chip ever in a smartphone;1Pro camera system with 12MP Ultra Wide, Wide and Telephoto cameras; 4x optical zoom range; Night mode, Deep Fusion, Smart HDR 3, Apple ProRAW, 4K Dolby Vision HDR recording;- LiDAR Scanner for improved AR experiences, Night mode portraits;- 12MP TrueDepth front camera with Night mode, 4K Dolby Vision HDR recording;- Industry-leading IP68 water resistance- Supports MagSafe accessories for easy attachment and faster wireless charging;- the battery it’s really good, if you use it all day you gonna end the day with 20%, if you don’t use it that much you will end the day with 50/60% of battery;- The 3 cameras are amazing, you can take some amazing photos even in dark thanks to the lidar sensor witch helps the focus of the cameras;- The chance to edit video on this phone really open a word of possibility for people that enjoy these things;At last I would recommend this phone to a new iPhone users for an amazing experience and to iPhone users who has a model holder then the Xs.

This device requires two hands to operate correctly due to the ""swipe up from bottom"" feature. Switching between apps with one hand is torture and my hand hurts after only 10 min of using the new phone. Gripping the phone lower so that I reach the bottom part easier makes it very difficult to hold it and I dropped it while trying to figure out how Apple expects me to hold the phone so I can reach the very bottom of the screen.I switched to this from an iPhone 7 MAX, which I could use confortably with one hand from day 1!The phone is nice, the camera seems to be really good, but unless you need a better camera and you are ok with using two hands on the phone most of the time, I recommend sticking to the older models that have a home button, or switch to Android.
"
10822,B08L5QPJNW,5,"
Upgraded from the 11 Pro and am very happy with it. Camera is far better and the screen is much brighter. A14 chip is blazingly my fast compared to the 11 Pro. The design looks good and the phone is easy to hold. Might be just me but I find it heavier and the 11 pro and also one hand use is out of the question now. If you’re happy with the 11 Pro there is no need to get this, but if you are using anything XS or below, hand over your cash to Apple RIGHT NOW!!!
"
10823,B08L5QPJNW,5,"
Upgraded from iPhone X and it was definitely worth it! Improvement in speed (A14 processor)and massive upgrade in camera department. Photos are excellent! Pricey, but it's a premiumsmartphone and it's worth it. iOS is another reason to go for it, much more stable than Androidwhich crashes more often. Good job Apple!

I just couldn't believe when I received the box. It was very slim. Where did they put the charger?Answer: They didn't.Apple doesn't provide chargers anymore. The official excuse ( that no intelligent person will believe) is ""we are ""saving the environment. ""The real reason is that people at Apple found a. new way to increase their profits and at the same time pretend they care about the environment.People who are buying an iPhone for the first time (how many millions? ) will have to buy either a normal charger and pay £20 for it  or buy  a mag safe and pay £40.  It will add environmental cost of shipping and more boxes. If anything, Apple is managing to cause more damage to the planet by not adding a charger to the box. But as long as their profits grow, they dont' care. And they will be selling far more chargers and mags now than they ever did before.People who had a Samsung, for example, and are changing to iPhone will also have to buy a charger.It's shocking to see so many five stars reviews about  a phone which doesn't have a charger.Then again,  as the saying goes, ""there is a s... born every minute"" .  S.... who  buy a phone without a charger and praise it to high heavens.Meanwhile, Apple is counting the extra money they are making with chargers and MagSafe.

Although it shows usually dispatched within 1-2 months, it actually faster than expected. I order this new phone 5 days ago and it delivered today. I was expected it’s gonna take few weeks but just 5 days. The Pacific blue is beautiful in hand. Upgraded from 7plus to 12pro is a great improvement. Speaker sounds loudly and camera is amazing. Especially when I took the video it’s not shaking like 7plus did. Faster response and bigger screen, very good experience.

I, like everyone else considering this product, was a bit wary of ordering a renewed phone instead of a new one, without seeing it first anyway. However, upon arrival & first look the phone is in impeccable condition! Everything seems to work as it should and the screen, edges, cameras etc are all free from any signs of use. I do however have two criticisms. The first, is that the battery health is only at 83%. My old iPhone is better than that at around 91/92! Still, it’s a second hand phone and it works. It’s really not the end of the world. It does it’s job and seems fine.My main issue was the delivery. When I heard that the phone was being sent through Evri my heart sank. I’ve lost so many parcels with them lately, this is actually the first parcel I’ve ever had arrive in one piece from them. The parcel was lost, then turned up again, then lost again, delayed, and finally arrived a week after it was due and then thrown over my 6ft garden fence. Luckily however, the phone is in one piece. I would just urge the seller to reconsider who they are using to send these devices.I would gladly buy another device from this company when the time comes, but not if Evri are taking anything to do with it.

I had been waiting iPhone 14 to be released before deciding which phone to go for. I would normally buy the latest phone unlocked and choose the best monthly rolling sim option. However, after weighing up the cost and functionality (iPhone 14 seemed a marginal functionality improvement at significantly increased cost), I came to the conclusion that a renewed iPhone 12 pro max offered much better value at around half the price. I choose the 'excellent condition' and have been very pleased with the result - especially as this is the first time I have taken this route. I have had the phone from Phones Direct for almost a month now and there have been no issues. There were no scratches/blemishes. The battery health was 87% and has remained so (the guarantee is >80%). I would have liked more (who wouldn't!) but it hasn't been an issue. Would definitely recommend

The screen freezes quite often and the battery life is a bit low but it looks absolutely fine. But mine didn’t come with a charger or a plug
"
10842,B08PCCKZR7,4,"
It didn’t come with screen protection and phone cover

I was wary about going for a refurbished phone after reading reviews about other so called market leading companies, however the feedback on this company made me take the plunge and I’m glad I did.  Quick delivery and the condition is as good as out of the box new but at massive discount, battery maximum capacity is 86% which is not an an issue.  The added bonus was the 12 month interest free payment option which was quick and easy to set up.  I kept my current unlimited data contract so it was a simple switch over of the SIM once the phones had synchronised with each other, it’s so easy these days!  I’ve estimated a saving over 2 years of around £700 compared with getting a refurbished phone of this specification from my service provider.  Bargain!

Excellent like new
"
10845,B08PCCKZR7,4,"
It's a great phone, like new and faultless performance. The battery life isn't wonderful but adequate. Nevertheless I'm really pleased with it, who needs iPhone 13 or 14?

I am absolutely shocked and appalled by the service and product that has been provided to me. I bought this phone as a Grade A iPhone 12 Pro Max, fully refurbished. I used this phone for around 2 months before it became completely unusable. I was using my phone as normal, when one day the screen just stopped working entirely. I thought maybe it was just a glitch and did everything that usually fixes the problem, restart, update etc. But nothing worked.I contacted Clover Mobiles and sent my phone off to be repaired; they refused to cooperate unless I payed a further £325 for a new screen, which was not even damaged at all. They didn't bother to look at the phone at all and decided the fault was due to a drop because there was a minor blemish on the corner of the phone. I decided to do some research myself and the component that processes touch on the phone, called a digitiser, cannot be broken simply from a drop on this model of phone. This proves Clover did nothing to look at the product or even try and find a solution.To make matters worse, I then spoke to an Amazon member of staff who informed me I can get a full refund for the entire amount of the product; I was extremely happy to hear this only for the horrendous staff at Clover to inform me that if I send the phone back they will just send it straight back to me. Amazon have let me down by saying I will be getting a full refund, only to be turned down by the seller. The phone even has a 1 year return policy if it doesn't work, which it doesn't!So after hearing this, I decided to look inside the phone to see if anything is loose or broken inside, which I could not break myself. And the inside of the phone is in such poor condition; there is soldering work that is so poorly done and the back of the screen, has a rip, I assume (like Clover Mobiles do), from a previous repair on the phone. Please see the images above and I implore you not to buy a product from these sellers, I do not want anyone else in the same situation.

Pretty sure the condition was listed as excellent but it did have some minor damage although that hasn’t impacted on it’s use
"

Battery only 85%I was expecting above 90% for excellent condition.
"
10849,B08PCCKZR7,4,"
Phone has a fault when on calls the volume cuts down very low.  The company are happy to change it but unlike if you purchase direct from Apple they will not send you a replacement to transfer your pictures music etc over before having to send back.  Bare this in mind it could be worth paying the extra to Apple as in warranty service is the best ever.

The physical condition was excellent but the battery health was only 82% which was a little disappointing for the premium price paid.

Straight out of the packaging this phone looks like it’s NEW, not a mark on it!Battery life shows at 100% 😲So far it seems to be working perfectly!Comes with 1 year warranty, too! 🧐Excellent value for money on this refurbished phone 😁Absolutely recommended!

Battery life is 87% but still ok for me. No single scratch on the phone. It looks good as new. Face recognition function perfectly. Will definitively recommend this phone to friends and family.
"
10858,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
The phone arrived and it’s absolutely stunning. No apparently marks whatsoever. Everything works perfectly. The battery life is at 88%. Looks like brand new if it had arrived in the original box.

You can never go wrong with an Apple item, but the seller is highly recommended

I was pleasantly surprised by this phone which was sent by Phones Direct Uk. I have been using it for almost a week now and have encountered absolutely no issues. Battery health was at 90% which I can’t really complain about. As for the actual body of the phone itself, it came in perfect condition, no marks or scratches at all on any part of the phone. Speakers work perfectly, as well as touchscreen, cameras, face ID, etc. I would definitely recommend buying refurbished through Amazon for a fair price, rather than the extortionate prices charged elsewhere. Less than £700 for what looks and acts like a brand new iPhone that is a fairly recent release. I know through Amazon Marketplace phones are sent from different individual companies so I cannot speak for all, but I am very happy with the phone I’ve received.

10871,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
In a nutshell, the iPhone 12 pro max I bought is like a new phone. I never purchased a second-hand phone before, I have no regrets about buying this one I’m planning to buy another phone from the seller again. I hereby recommend this seller, I never believed that second-hand phones would be in that excellent condition.
"
10872,B08PCCKZR7,3,"
Battery health is not good it’s just  83% it was bit disappointing. They should write’s exact battery health.
"
10873,B08PCCKZR7,4,"
This is my first ever Iphone and so far I have been okay with it,I got a very good condition barely used phone and no damages or marks around it ( might got lucky)everything is currently working as it should, Yes it's high on price but still its Apple sadly
"
10874,B08PCCKZR7,3,"
Unfortunately the phone sides were scratched deeply . The screen and back were clear though . It seemed that the previous owner had been a bit careless .The scratches were deep enough to be felt and the metallic rim felt as though it was rusted ??I used first class mail to return the iPhone , cost me 5.5 £ , the seller only refunded the phone cost even though it was clearly mentioned that the return cost will be refunded as well .The phone had not been cleaned either .Though battery was working as advertised and phone didn't have any other obvious defect .Over all a poor experience on Amazon and by the seller .Will stick to first hand goods only in future .

I actually didn’t realise the phone was a used renewed phone when I bought it, thought it was brand new but either way it came in immaculate condition with no visible signs of use. Hopefully there aren’t any problems as time goes by! But for now very good
"
10879,B08PCCKZR7,2,"
I'm going to keep it short and sweet - Ordered three phones from three different vendors, each supposedly in ""excellent condition"". First one had a severely deteriorated battery apparently, second had a bizarre screen fitted that was definitely not Apple. Maybe it was pear. Third has chips all around the bezel and the PVC coating has worn away. Note: the last two also had battery lives of 80% and 83%. If this is excellent quality, what do you get with ""acceptable"" - The bezel alone?
"
10880,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
Face recognition is so easy and much better security than I’ve had previously. I’ve never been an iPhone fan but my husband bought me this and I must admit I love everything about it.

First time buying a refurbished phone. Look like a new!! Ordered yesterday received today. Easy set up. Can’t wait to write this review.  Will keep you updated after a few months’ use.After a month, not sure about the screen. It’s dull although brightness is adjust to 90%.Sometimes the screen keeps flipping when I press my finger on certain app. Don’t know why.
"
10884,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
I've had this product for one week now. Battery came at 89% after a few days usage it went to 88%. But, it still lasts me all day! It's a big change for me as I've had an iPhone 8 Plus over the past couple of years. I was quite skeptical about ordering this product but I took the risk and I'm happy so far! :) Really wanted to buy a iPhone 12 Pro Max outright at a good price and it's great that it can be returned within a year!They delivered it within a day. No major scratches on the phone, it was just dirty around the camera lenses and in the mute button. Everything else is brilliant so far, the back and front camera quality is amazing! I have no other complaints, will update this review over the coming months.
"
10885,B08PCCKZR7,4,"
I turned it on and it worked like an iphone so we chilling

My wife has serious phone envy when she sees the photos I take on my iPhone 12 Pro Max and the way it syncs with my iPad. So, being the loving husband I decided to buy her the same phone, but refurbished to save hundreds of pounds on what I paid for mine new about 9 months ago.I was almost put off by the reviews on here, but decided to buy as I knew I could return the phone if it was damaged in any way.I made the right decision and my wife is delighted. The phone looks like it is new and has 100% battery life. Mega brownie points for me.And the 1 year warranty is fantastic.We just have to see now who can take the best photos with our top of the range iPhones.

I was worried about spending £600 on a reconditioned phone, but after reading reviews on the seller went for a iphone 12 max pro.Phoned arrived in good time, package was basic, with charging cable, plug, and card removal pin.Phone is spotless, looks brand new with no visible marks at all... screen is also totally mark free, all systems working fine, and the battery is saying its at 98% chargeable to its max level. All in all very happy with my purchase.
"
10890,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
When I received my new phone, they included a charger which apple don’t do, a 100 percent battery life. It was worth buying.
"
10891,B08PCCKZR7,4,"
88% battery capacity when it arrived, surely for a refurbed unit put a new one in.
"
10892,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
I never write reviews but..... Brand new phone, not even a single scratch. Very pleased with this product. I would never buy an iphone from an Apple Store again! Good for your pocked and for the planer as well! Fast delivery comes with the essentials. I'll get back with a battery life review after 6 months. If you still wonder whether to buy it or now, go ahead, you won't regret it!

I just got this phone delivered to me yesterday.For the money i spent i can say it is in a decent shape.It has some scratches on the screen which are pretty visible, on the sides as well.Overall i am quite happy with the product, it came with 96% battery so i dunno.Delivery was ok too.
"
10895,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
So far so good “….
"
10896,B08PCCKZR7,2,"
Battery was 88 % this is 3 years worth of useI recommend battery replacement , i contacted the seller and they were happy if its over 80%I wish to be considered for a replacement with a better battery health same condition though
"
10897,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
So the Iphone came the next day i made the purchase.90% Battery Life, honestly no scratch and including things on the photo (charger plug, cable and a voucher… also the phone). If this is a second hand phone, shows then that previous owner used to keep it with case and protector (same as me) so happy for the purchase.I would have preferred signed delivery from Royal Mail maybe (as it is an expensive parcel), but if you organize well yourself, you can pick it up quickly.Hope this helps
"
10898,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
I’ve been using the phone for a few weeks now, and it is much better than I thought it would be. I upgraded from the 7 plus, and was very pleased at the quality of the phone when it arrived. There were no scratches, and the battery was 92% of a brand new phone (the description said it would guarantee 80%). I definitely saved a lot of money!
"
10899,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
I am really impressed with the value of the phone I received! I was a bit sceptical at first knowing that it was a refurbished iPhone however once I received my package I was overjoyed with what I had been given! The phone looks almost brand new! No scratches on the screen, the sides are in perfect condition and the back is immaculate!! The battery health on the phone is 92% which ofc isn’t perfect but the phone still last well over a day, and I’d say I use my phone moderately to high amount!!I got the iPhone 12 Pro Max Blue 256GB two days after I ordered it! Even though it said it would take about a week!10/10 for this! Very impressed!
"
10900,B08PCCKZR7,3,"
Cannot fault the quality of the device itself, looks like new! However, the phone comes with a Lighting>USBC cable but a USB A adapter, so that’s not very helpful, could be wrong? The other thing was that the phone came with 0% battery so couldn’t turn it on for a while and I thought something was wrong with it at first as I had it on charge for 30 minutes before it seemed to come into life?!Lastly, delivery - you cannot choose Amazon locker and DPD just left it on the floor outside the house which is pretty crazy considering the cost of it
"
10901,B08PCCKZR7,4,"
This good for value
"
10902,B08PCCKZR7,2,"
The phone is not that good bro and I payed 630 the battery life is not good
"
10903,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
The phone looked absolutely mint basically brand new can’t complain really really happy with my purchase as a 1 year warranty with Amazon renewal great scheme would 100% buy from this device and the company who sold it again

10905,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
I Was dubious about spending £700 on a used phone but after receiving this flagship iPhone, I couldn’t be happier. Face recognition works perfectly, battery health is 100…… yes 100%, and the phone itself is near perfect. One tiny scratch on the top edge. That’s it, apart from an even smaller scratch on the screen that I’ll never even notice. I only saw it while I was scrutinising the whole phone. In addition, you get an Apple adapter (unlike with a new iPhone).Amazon renewed from now on for my next iPhone.
"
10906,B08PCCKZR7,3,"
Unfortunately the phone was received with a crack in the corner on the screen. Easy to miss unless viewed at an angle in daylight. We all make mistakes. Apart from that excellent service and fantastic iPhone.
"
10907,B08PCCKZR7,2,"
Received phone with only 82% capacity, very disappointed.
"
10908,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
There’s always a little bit of trepidation when buyingSomething second hand but this time very happy with the phone . No marks scratches whatsoever just looks like new with a massive saving.
"
10909,B08PCCKZR7,2,"
Having ordered several renewed phones from Amazon. I might give it a miss from now on as suppliers are now supplying phones with the battery at 81% health. My older iPhone 8+ has a better life than that and this newer model was purchased to replace it. But as the Amazon rule is 80% some suppliers are using this to their advantage to get shot of their stock.  The phone was quite dirty when delivered but no visible scratches which was probably the only bonus.  If you up for a game of chance go for it but ideally I’ll go somewhere where I can visibly see the product before purchase.
"
10910,B08PCCKZR7,4,"
I do like this phone and the great price I paid for it. However it’s too big and starts to hurt your hand after a while and my hands are bigger than the phone!
"
10911,B08PCCKZR7,3,"
Everything is okay apart from screen scratch which is quite noticeable. it might not affect your use but still there.
"

I absolutely love my iPhone 12 Pro Max.The battery life is not as much good but overall fine . Fantastic camera.
"
10913,B08PCCKZR7,1,"
Bought IPhone 12 Pro Max as a present for a relative. Supposedly grade A condition, come with large very noticeable scratch. Tried using portrait mode on camera which would go completely black and not work and then also not let any other option be selected on the camera to take a normal photograph. When receiving a call the phone would completely freeze and not work to the point of having to reset the whole phone and set up as new. Thought with being a grade A it would be fine to buy refurbished but I would 100% advise anyone to not buy second hand or from this seller.
"
10914,B08PCCKZR7,2,"
Came with a few scratches but most thing I don’t like how it’s screen has been polished poorly to get rid of its scratches not the best pleased but have it under a screen protector so don’t see it but you’d think for the amount of money you spend you’d think it would be better musicmagpie I wouldn’t rate 👎🏻
"
10915,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
Face recognition seems to be working as it should be, battery life was 100% when I bought the first time and now is 97% I haven’t had any issues with this one whatsoever and also great price, I would definitely recommend this one phone.

Face ID didn't work on the iPhone, I received today. Even though it was described as in excellent condition... Can't trust the seller:( It is a lottery whether you'll get a good one or with an issue like in my case.
"
10920,B08PCCKZR7,1,"
Camera had many faults including a black dot on screen when using the 2.5x lens. This would appear in every photo taken using that lens. Also, reflections would occur on images as seen in image two with the cat. This is not acceptable on a £660 phone. The battery capacity was at 89% when received and although this is not the worst it could be (as stated they sell phones with up to 80% capacity), this combined with the faulty camera really made the phone not acceptable. I would strongly recommend not buying this product.

Bought this phone for myself battery life was 82% only lasted 3 hours on a full charge so had to replace at my own cost but the company did pay 50% towards a new battery the phone was bought as excellent condition the screen was flawless but the frame had deep scratches on the screen surrounding the Main camera on the rear off the phone the 2.5mm makes wired noises when trying to focus and sometimes bouncing around on screen all round the phone is in bad condition for the money go somewhere else
"
10924,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
Phone may not have come with it's original box or charger, but I did get an original Apple cable and the charger that came with came with dual USB-A ports, which is even more useful.
"
10925,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
If you have any doubts, kill them immediately. Only thing that was disappointing is that the phone came with the old USB to lightning cable as opposed to the new USB C to lightning cable. But besides that, this thing is an amazing buy for the price
"
10926,B08PCCKZR7,1,"
Very disappointed in the condition of the phone I received! I paid for excellent condition, however that wasn’t what I received!The camera lenses, all 3 lenses were chipped around the edges! The gold casing around the phone was all scratched.I didn’t even turn the phone on, as wasn’t accepting it in the condition I received it.Very disappointing indeed!
"
10927,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
I will never buy a new iPhone again bought the 12pro max renewed it is in as new condition not a single fingerprint never mind a scratch on the phone, battery health at 95% which is as close to perfect as I could expect, and only £650 really it is 5* if you need a phone use this service
"
10928,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
99% battery and not a mark on it and virtually half price! Pained me to have to buy one as I was robbed but really pleased with value for money and will probably never buy new again!
"
10929,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
Was slightly worried about some negative reviews and risks with getting a refurbished iPhone, but it turned out great. Only negatives are the fact it doesn't come in the original box, and the cable is USB-B. The device itself is absolutely spotless, not a single scratch detected after I looked closely for a good 10mn.The battery shows 99% so no complaint here either. Really good experience overall, would definitely recommend.
"
10930,B08PCCKZR7,1,"
Disappointed as it does not come with a basic charger, so what's the point and you cannot check the item as it needs charging, typical, so first impressions are very very poor
"
10931,B08PCCKZR7,4,"
Meet my expectations
"
10932,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
The phone arrived earlier than expected. Except there is couple of minor scratches (hardly visible) on the screen otherwise looks brand new. I’m very happy with my purchase
"
10933,B08PCCKZR7,2,"
Not to the high standard of ‘renewed’ from Amazon that I have been used to in the past.The screen is badly scratched, the bezel edge around the screen is chipped and the ear speaker is not working when making or receiving calls.A far cry from the “This product works and looks like new.” and the “Excellent condition (Refurbished)” write up.
"
10934,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
Great product and looked new.
"
10935,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
The phone is in excellent condition working perfectly no scratches battery is really good
"
10936,B08PCCKZR7,1,"
I am giving it 1 star because it is a really terrible experience for me in my purchase life. I got a not working cable and I requested it again and again but the seller did not solve it. The phone works but it is missing and not functional phone without the original cable. Please do not buy musigmapie on Amazon.

A lot of scratches on board, is not excellent condition.
"
10944,B08PCCKZR7,1,"
I thought buying a refurbished was not only good for recycling/planet but also getting an up to date phone cheaper seeing as most phones have built in obsolescence now.  Unfortunately the phone I received, although in excellent condition, produced exceptional heat during my use, so much so, I turned it off as I was concerned about it exploding and further consideration that it would catch fire during the night etc.  i contacted the company and was asking did I use it while it was being charged, I queried this as with my previous iPhone I used while being charged without problems.  I was happy to have it repaired providing the battery, if that was the problem, or other parts were Apple accredited but was advised that the parts were not Apple but other manufacturers replication which concerned me once more, I then requested a refund.  So I would suggest to anyone, be careful when purchasing a refurbished phone or just buy a cheaper model if your budget restraint is a consideration.

I was initially concerned about buying a renewed but after receiving it today I could not be happier. Phone is in perfect condition, came with a screen protector already installed. Battery percentage at 92%. Very pleased with the purchase

The product description which states: ""No signs of cosmetic damage (scratches, dents, etc.) will be visible when the product is held 30 centimeters away"" turned out be a complete lie. The phone came with 2 very noticeable scratches on its screen, which more on its sides. There is also chip damage on its upper corner. These are all viseable from a metre away in a normally lit room, which become very obvious outside and under room lights. The delivery was fast and reliable so can't fault them there.

I would not advise anyone one to get this product, better to save money and buy a new iphone, or better still, getting one on a contract would sufficeThe device quality is absolutely poor, from the camera quality down to the battery. Quality is not as described by the seller, just deceit. I have requested for a refund and hope I would get back my moneyI have purchased some supposed quality products that turned out defective  however, this is worst, I have never regretted purchasing an item of this nature before..

To begin, the package arrived three days earlier than expected, which was surprising; the phone itself was not in a box upon arrival, which was worrying, although the phone was covered in a thick layer of plastic wrap.  I did see some minor scratches on the screen, but they were not noticeable unless you looked closely.  Otherwise, there was no other damage.  The phone was a bit dirty but was easily cleaned.After using the phone for about a month, I realized this was an excellent upgrade.  Yes, it was expensive, although I moved up from an iPhone 8, so the pros outweighed the cons.  What are the cons?  The maximum hold on the battery is 91%, not fantastic, but it is way better than my iPhone 8; it outlives that phone by a mile.  It is a heavier phone, and I wasn't expecting the weight of it.  I can hold it with one hand and still type with the holding hand, although the weight on my pinky as I hold it up does hurt after a while.  The price was quite a bit for a refurbished phone, in my opinion, but as an upgrade, the phone is impressive.For Pros, this phone has a different layout; it took me a mere week to get over the fact there is no button; remember, I upgraded from an iPhone 8, where the button still exists.  Honestly, I prefer face recognition; it is just way more easier to do anything, rather than failing the touch ID over and over.  Again as the battery was also a con, it is also a pro; it lasts way longer than my iPhone 8 ever did.  Something I shouldn't have to go over, but the camera is divine; it is so surreal to me.  I love it.  As for calling people and so on, everyone can hear me very clearly, and I hear them better.  Lastly, the speakers are excellent; I feel like it is surround sound almost, compared to my iPhone 8, this iPhone 12 Pro Max is just outstanding.Overall, this was a wonderful upgrade, although it did have some cons as not everything is perfect.

Relieved when my phone arrived in a really lovely environmentally friendly box. No damage or scratches to be seen on the phone at all, looks brand new, battery life 90%. Was ready to be set up with about 10% charge. Came with a plug and charging cable. As you can see on the photo it can be registered for a one year warranty. Bought through UR, delivered by Royal Mail 48hrs after ordering. Will defos come back to them in a few years to upgrade once more. Highly recommend.
"
11001,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
The product was delivered on time and in great condition. After thinking about whether I should get a 12 pro max or 13, I'm glad I got this. I'm still getting use to the very big screen but it's also another reason I like the phone—definitely, value for money.Just a slight thing tho, the packaging could have been better as it came in a cardboard box with very little protection.

This is my first time of buying a renewed iPhone from Amazon. The product is in excellent condition with a battery level of 85%. The phone is very clean with no mark at all. It is working perfectly well. It is a good way to save money on a latest phone.The price is very competitive and delivery was super fast. Excellent customer service from Amazon as usual.I strongly recommend renewed phones, there is no much difference with brand new and you will save a lot of money.The guarantee is One year as well, and mine came with Apple care till 12 November 2022.

Cannot fault this phone! I was slightly sceptical to buy a refurbished phone but I did not need to worry, Mazuma (provider might be different for others) really pulled through! Perfect condition and 100% battery health, it was already charged so I could use it straight away. Definitely worth getting a more reasonably priced iPhone 12 Pro Max than the iPhone Pro Max 13, which only has a couple more features that I wouldn't even care about. Thanks again Mazuma!
"
11015,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
Wonderful!! Really wonderful
"
11016,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
It’s a very good and just the right size too. The only problem is that the battery health being a bit low at 91% but that not a big deal to me as it still lasts me the entire day without charging it.

Great phone so far, always wary with refurb but with Amazon 1 year hopefully cross fingers will be ok, advert states a plug included they seem to disagree, wrong lead sent but am using my original lead, definitely worth upgrade from XR to 12 Pro Max. Disappointed with 82% battery others state they had 95% at least may have to replace battery sooner than I thought
"
11020,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
The phone works perfectly well. It is exactly what was described in the advert. Battery life 87%. I have no reason to complain.

                    The media could not be loaded.
                



 £740 is a big old chunk of cash to spend when some of the reviews showed trashed phones and talked of difficult returns. I had decided to buy a new iPhone at £1000 instead because of the bad reviews but there was a 2 month wait and I’m inpatient so rolled the dice. As you can see in the video of me opening the package the 12 ProMax I got was pristine, battery health was 99% and I’m delighted, it comes well packaged in a box similar to the Apple design with a generic lightning charger and sim pin. I think it would be useful if the condition of the actual phone you’ll get was somewhere in the description rather than generic text, I know three conditions are described in one of the pictures but I could not find these referenced in the description.
"
11022,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
I was slightly worried after ordering this product as I’ve started to read through the reviews of convincing lack of quality from this company but nothing could be further from the truth.I have ordered the refurbished phone (close to new), I have done every check on the phone that I possibly could and I’ve concluded that the product I received was worth every penny. If you’re the type to care about the smallest scuff on your phone then please just buy a brand new phone. My screen has a couple scratches but it was not noticeable unless you look through a microcope. They have not cut any corners, full OLED screen, camera is crisp, touch screen has no faults.The only negative that alot of people seem to share is the battery percentage but that’s a loss I can take for the price. Anyways worry not, you’re safe with this purchase. :)Edit: wow, didn't expect that many people to find this review helpful. glad i could help.

The phone's physical condition is good, with no scratches; it looks like a brand-new iPhone.  I liked the phone's colour (pacific blue), and the battery health was around 88% when it arrived. The camera is working fine. After using it for more than a month now, I am satisfied with my purchase. Worth investing. No screen freeze or other issues.

No marks on body or edges3. There is a tiny dot on the screen visible at very specific angle while trying hard. So I wouldn’t be bothered a lotPerformance;1. I have used the phone for over 2 weeks now and have had no issues at all2. Battery % when received was 87% which is advertised and acceptable
"
11027,B08PCCKZR7,4,"
Really good quality, no scratches or scuffs at all. The only problem is the battery health. It’s not too bad but 86% isn’t the best considering it’s £700. Except for that it’s great!

11028,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
First time buying a renewed phone but my iPhone X was so painful to use + Face ID didn’t work and front camera didn’t work from where I smashed the screen, it was like that for 2 years and I had finally had enough, looked around for a while, compared specs of 12, 13, 14 pro max, not much in it compared with the price scaling, looked on back market and almost ordered from there, checked trust pilot and there were a lot of bad reviews, checked on here, found this, ordered it, it came, barely a thing wrong with it, the tiniest mark on the screen which I can’t even see with a screen protector on, cameras work perfectly, Face ID works perfectly, battery life is impeccable, this was such a good deal and I feel so lucky to have come across it, it sounds dumb but it feels so good to have a newer faster phone like I don’t know, it just feels great, I love it, will definitely be doing this again in years time or however long I can make this phone last for! 😁 100% recommend!

La confezione è spartanissima, il prodotto è  giunto in buone condizioni,  ed anche se la scocca i gusci ed il vetro sono perfetti, la batterie era all85% anche se comprato  come “perfette condizioni” inavvertitamente ci è caduta un po di acqua sopra e per 15 minuti anche se spento e perfettamente asciugato alla riaccensione l'alto parlante ed il microfono gracchiavano.Quindi in ansia per lIP 68 che credo non vi sia.

Il telefono è perfetto. Le condizioni erano pari al nuovo e così infatti è risultato. Sembra quasi che nessuno l’abbia mai utilizzato. Nessun graffio e nessuna ammaccatura. Se si vuole acquistare un ricondizionato è bene stare attenti al grado riguardanti le condizioni. Avendo acquistato diversi ricondizionati non mi sono trovata mai male nel scegliere quelli in condizioni eccellenti o pari al nuovo. Unica piccola pecca può essere la batteria che si presenta all’89%. Ma avendo già avuto una batteria simile posso dire che non crea nessun tipo di problema.Oltre al telefono nella scatola era presente il cavetto con il caricatore originali e con la pellicola di imballaggio della Apple. Quindi mai usati.Mi sento di consigliare vivamente questo venditore.
"
11037,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
Sono rimasto veramente sorpreso. Il telefono è arrivato con 1 giorno di anticipo. Display come nuovo, nemmeno un micro graffio. Parte posteriore del telefono come nuova. L'unica pecca è il bordo con 6 micro ammaccature, ma anche con una cover trasparente non si vedono. Stato della batteria al 96%. Il telefono funziona perfettamente. Rapporto qualità prezzo super bilanciato. 5 stelle meritatissime!

11038,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
Edit: acquistato in grafite per mio marito, arrivato iPhone altrettanto perfetto al mio, con batteria altrettanto al 91%. Immacolato letteralmente pari al nuovo👏🏼Per ora - non sapessi di averlo pagato quel che ho pagato e non ci fosse la batteria al 91% (su tel di due anni), penserei che si tratti di un iPhone nuovo di pacco😱Esteticamente immacolato. Non un segno graffio o ombra👍🏼Al momento, perfettamente funzionante👍🏼Vedremo nel tempo…ma a prescindere vado tranquilla grazie alla garanzia Amazon Renewed che consente reso e rimborso per un anno intero 🙏🏼 grazie Amazon e grazie al venditore che me lo ha spedito con velocità da teletrasporto - quando in teoria arrivava 10gg dopo. Eccezionale.

Esperienza al di sopra delle aspettative. Il prodotto è arrivato in due giorni lavorativi, molto meglio del previsto, in un imballo corretto.

Es el tercer móvil que compro de Amazon, y el único que me llega con buena salud de batería . A la tercera va la vencida !!! . La verdad es que estoy encantada con el, es precioso, me vino con un par de rasguñitos pequeños en el lateral, pero nada que una funda no tape, la salud de la batería me llego con un 97%. Un chollo. Estoy contentísima. Lo que pasa es que puedes tener la suerte de que te llegue con un 80% de salud(como mi anterior iPhone XS Max) o con un 97% de salud(como este mismo)Pero a mi me parece genial económicamente esta opción de poder comprar reacondicionados. Solo que como dije antes, puede salirte bien, o no. En caso de no salirte bien la batería, devuelves y pruebas otro.

avendo letto altre recensioni di resi per danneggiamento allo schermo o al corpo del telefono ero titubante, ma il telefono è arrivato con un giorno di anticipo ed era perfetto.zero segni o graffi, come da immagini allegate.nella scatola trovate anche il caricatore, il cavo usb c/lightning e la graffetta a spillo per estrarre/inserire la sim (che erano un po’ buttati lì a caso, ma per un ricondizionato non originale non mi formalizzerei).consiglio l’acquisto, anche perché garantito dal reso Amazon per un anno (motivo principale che mi ha spinto all’acquisto nonostante i dubbi di cui sopra).UPDATE: a distanza di un paio di giorni mi sono resa conto che la batteria si scaricava in modo strano, e andando a cercare tra le impostazioni ho visto che il suo stato di salute era di una carica massima dell'87%. ho fatto il reso e sto attendendo il rimborso

Venia con una de las cámaras un poco rallada(que no influye para nada). La única pega que le podría poner es que me vino con un 82% de salud de batería, pero igualmente aguanta un día entero sin problemas ni fallos, al precio que lo he comprado es normal que tenga algún detallito. Una batería nueva tampoco vale mucho, llevo un mes de uso y va perfecto y tiene garantía.

Comme beaucoup je me méfiais d'une mauvaise surprise en faisant le choix du reconditionné et bien je ne me suis trompé. J'ai acheté auprès de ce vendeur un iPhone 12 Pro Max en excellent etat et le moins que l'on puisse dire c'est que la promesse est tenue. Etat impeccable, aucune rayure, livraison en avance. Et en prime une batterie à 94% de sa pleine capacité. Je suis ravi de mon achat.

Juste la batterie qui est à 90% sinon rien à dire.

Rien a dire il est en très bon état et encore sous AppleCare je recommande

11061,B08PCCKZR7,3,"
Franchement pour un téléphone reconditionné nickel au niveau de esthétique rien à redire mais par contre la batterie a 79% de ça capacité alors que le téléphone coûte quand même 850 euro c’est vraiment abusé c’est vraiment dommage ça partait bien

Arrivato in anticipo, ottimo come nuovo consigliato.

J ai reçu mon telephone il etait parfait a part le son ! Je l ai montré a un spécialiste apple qui m a expliqué que rapidement cela allait lacher et j en aurai pour 200 euros ... j attend toujours mon etiquette prepayer car j ai reçu l accord pour le retour mais a mes frais !Ce n est pas ma faute si le telephone ne fonctionne pas donc... le service n est pas efficace et tres long pour la reponse et je me pose des questions pour le remboursement ....

Telefono arrivato addirittura in anticipo,come nuovo nessun graffio tutto assolutamente funzionante grazie mille
"
11067,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
Il telefono è stato consegnato in condizioni eccellenti. Non presenta un minimo graffio, batteria completamente funzionante e il telefono svolge tutte le sue funzioni ed operazioni in tranquillità. Per essere un prodotto ricondizionato è davvero ottimo. In genere sono sempre stato scettico dei prodotti ricondizionati, ma questo acquisto mi ha lasciato davvero sorpreso. Consiglio vivamente a chiunque stia considerando di acquistare un telefono nuovo o voglia anche fare un regalo, il rapporto qualità prezzo è davvero il top.
"
11068,B08PCCKZR7,4,"
Sieht sehr neu aus, kein Kratzer und völlig zufrieden damit, aber eine Sache war ich nicht so zufrieden, die Batterie Kapazität war auf 84% was ich sehr schade finde! Sonst ist alles in Ordnung 👍

J'ai reçu le téléphone très récemment.👍👌Je vais évaluer le produit reconditionné.Le produit est arrivé:✅ Esthétique, dans un état proche du neuf.👌✅L'écran ne présente pas de rayures visibles.👌▶️Bon point , car il n'y a pas de verre de protection pour cacher la misère.😉🔺Un petit accroc sur le pourtour est visible mais reste mineur.🔺La batterie est à 84% de capacité maximum😕Dans la boîte un câble de charge et une épingle pour carte sim sont présents, ainsi qu'un chargeur.J'ai dans mon cas reçu le produit dans une boite ""no name"".😕.Photos à venir.En Conclusion: le produit est bon, je suis juste déçu pour la batterie.Dernier élément, c'est un modèle Usa, donc c'est embêtant car le téléphone n'est pas éligible sous Apple Care.Si utile, merci 👍🙂

Puntualità e come descrizione. Senza un graffio ottimo prodotto
"
11072,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
Ho comprato il prodotto rigenerato e devo dire che sono rimasto a bocca aperta. E' come nuovo, non un graffietto, perfetto. Amazon sempre preciso come sempre, sia per gli acquisti che per i resi, insomma per tutto. Mai una sbavatura o qualcosa che mi abbia fatto storcere il naso nel corso degli anni. E io in genere non sono uno fortunato 😂 Grazie Amazon

Le téléphone est intact, au défaut sur l'écran, l'arrière est nickel juste une minuscule égratignures au niveau d'une touche sur le côté mais faut vraiment regarder pour le voir et batterie à 97% . Franchement nous on on est super content, je vous recommande ce vendeur. Après ça fait seulement 3 jrs qu'on la donc j'espère qu'il n'y aura pas de soucis à la longue. Je sais pas si il y a une garantie sur l'article.

Il dispositivo è arrivato in condizioni estetiche perfette (si nota che è stata sostituita la parte posteriore) nessun graffio o segno di usura. Batteria al 94% (ben oltre le aspettative). Ho avuto un piccolo problema con lo speaker superiore risolto con un po’ di pulizia. Per ogni dubbio o informazione il venditore ha risposto sempre in maniera tempestiva.

Pas rayer. L’arrière est parfait.Le téléphone présente également des impacts, plusieurs. Le cadre en aluminium est également rayé et présente des imperfections visuelles autour des boutons.La batterie à une capacité de 87%, ce qui est correct.Je suis relativement satisfaite de mon achat, j’espère juste la durée dans le temps de mon produit.

Producto 100 % original. Apple me llegó una caja que no es la original porque es un móvil reconstruido. Lo que no me gusta es que me vino con de Salud 83 % de batería ya que la batería la recomienda Apple para cambiarla a los 80 % de salud y se me descarga un poco rápido, pero el móvil me va súper bien. Estoy probando y ya te daré más detalles a lo largo del uso

Prodotto consegnato con carica batterie sbagliato infatti non è il 20 watt e non ha il cavetto appropriato poi in considerazione che ho acquistato un rigenerato in condizioni eccellenti non avrebbe dovuto riportare il vetro graffiato in ben tre punti. Come rigenerato è da considerare in buone condizioni ma non eccellenti. Batteria con resa all’83 per cento.

Lieferung heute erhalten. Laut Beschreibung sollte es sich um ein generalüberholtes IPhone 12 Pro Max handeln, welches aussieht wie neu.Auf dem Display waren keine Macken, dafür umso mehr am Rahmen.An alle Ecken und Kanten befinden sich Kratzer und Riefen.Aber dann sowas als „Wie neu“ zu deklarieren ist eine Frechheit bei fast 800€. Karton war auch nicht original.Kabel und Ladegerät lagen separat in der Kiste. Billigste Ware (no Name)Akku Zustand bei 80% d.h. Fast 2 Jahre gebraucht.

The store I got my phone from is called Flip4shop. I’m very happy with the purchase. The condition was listed as “acceptable” There are some scratches on the screen at a few locations, and some scratches at the lightning port, but I really don’t care. My old phone was way more scratched up than this. Just slap on a glass screen protector and a case and it’s good as new. The battery lifespan is at 98%. What’s important to me are that no glass is cracked and a good battery. I’d hazard a guess this was a display model at a phone shop and have been played around by customers. For the price it was very value for money and I would not hesitate to buy my next phone here with them again.

Petit bémol 92% de batterie mais bon à ce prix je suis satisfaite pour le moment . Téléphone acheté hier à 13h30 reçu le lendemain à la même heure !! Quelle rapidité !!

Pensavo che un ricondizionato avesse la batteria al 100%. Questo articolo Iphone 12 pro max ha invece una batteria già usata, per la precisione ha l'86% di capacità (allego foto). Dopo 2 giorni ho notato anche alcuni puntini bianchi, simili a piccole ammaccature sulla parte laterale  (superficiali) dell'Iphone che erano stati oscurati sicuramente con qualche pennarello, e dopo qualche ora di uso tornati alla luce.Ne usufruisco qualche altro giorno e capisco se chiedere il reso.

Ho acquistato un iPhone 12 pro Max in condizioni eccellenti quindi al prezzo più alto. È arrivato in tempi brevi ma appena aperto il pacco mi ritrovo un telefono che non è in condizioni eccellenti come da descrizione poiché il bordo esterno e il bordino delle fotocamere erano graffiati e e con delle ammaccature. Non ero interessata a vederlo accesso, è stato sufficiente vederlo esternamente. Ho preparato il pacco per il reso che è già stato effettuato. Adesso aspetto il rimborso.

Il telefono è arrivato in super anticipo e in condizioni perfette: è praticamente nuovo e perfettamente funzionante.L’unica pecca, se vogliamo chiamarla così, è lo stato batteria all’88%, sceso all’86% dopo due aggiornamenti di sistema.Ora come ora non costituisce un gran problema perché il telefono mi dura un giorno e mezzo con utilizzo intenso, ma avrei avvertito. Soprattutto perché lo stato è “come nuovo”.

Le téléphone soit disant reconditionné en excellent état s’est arrêté de fonctionner en moins d une journée après la livraison. Je ne peux même plus le rallumer ou le charger. Je dois donc le restituer . C’est la dernière fois que j’achète du reconditionné. Le service d’assistance de Amazon a été nul. Ils m’ont conseillé de contacter Apple pour qu’il le rallume !!! Apple ne prendra jamais en charge un phone reconditionné qui ne vient pas de chez eux mais d’un vendeur Amazon. N’importe quoi…J’ai du en acheter un neuf en urgence pour travailler  . Bref du temps perdu

Il prodotto dicono che sia revisionato, speriamo sia così, perchè hanno dimenticato di pulirlo, infatti sono dovuto ricorrere al centro apple perchè si sentiva piano hanno dovuto pulire la parte audio adesso si sente bene, ma ho dovuto spendere altri 15 euro.Deluso

11136,B08PCCKZR7,2,"
Il prodotto si presenta apparentemente in buono stato, con un paio di  graffii sul display non evidentissimi, la batteria 86% e qui mi aspettavo un tantino in più avendo acquistato un prodotto con condizione eccellenti. La sorpresa è stata l’auricolare, che si sente davvero poco. Reso indispensabile!

Vraiment la livraison reste à désirer certe c’est vendu sans boîte je suis dàccord mais mettre le téléphone juste en dessous d’un petit carton… et la batterie ouais c’est marche minimum 85% de l’état mais enfin je part du principe que le téléphone coûte comme meme 900€ le minimum serrai d’avoir une meilleure état des batterie

Das Gerät war sauber ordentlich verpackt und in einem sehr guten Zustand. Aber derAkku war nur noch bei 90% deshalb Rücksendung.Habe über Warehouse ein IPhone 13 Pro Max bekommen welches wohl wirklich nur einmal ausgepackt wurde… Akku 100 % und Rind mehr fürs Geld… wenn man einmal soviel ausgibt…

Nel contesto lo smartphone e bellissimo , il problema è che se anche la batteria supera l’80% della sul stato , anche con un uso moderato non dura abbastanza . Il cell è in ottime condizioni peccato che per via della batteria si stia rivelando un acquisto pessimo
"
11170,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
Il prodotto è arrivato ben imballato in una scatola bianca con caricabatterie, cavo e telefono, visibilmente non ha nemmeno 1 graffio e aveva 90% di batteria, penso che sia un ottimo prodotto tenuto molto bene, consiglio vivamente di provare! ora non c'è altro che utilizzarlo e vedere se cambia qualcosa!

Salve ho comprato un rigenerato ma col prezzo alto per non avere problemi invece mi è arrivato un iPhone con una batteria al 80 per cento sono rimasto deluso

Mein alle erste Refurbished Produkt, hab mir unr meiner Frau einen iPhone 12 Pro Max geholt und wir waren wirklich begeistert. Ja die Verpackung ist nicht Original, interessiert uns aber nicht. Die beide Handys waren in Top Zustand, so zwei drei Gebrauchsspuren, aber fast unsichtbar. Meine Akku 100%, Akku von dem zweiten auf 95%. Die Handy benutzen wir jetzt seit 3 Wochen, echt Klasse, viel gespart für Handys die eig neu sind. Nächste Mal wieder Refurbished.

11181,B08PCCKZR7,5,"
Il prodotto è perfetto, sia nelle condizioni che per l’imballaggio. Mi sarebbe piaciuto che avesse scritto il deterioramento in percentuale della batteria. Avevo un’iphone 11 che ho preso a giugno 2020 e l’ho venduto con 93% di batteria, questo l’ho preso apparentemente intatto ma che alla fine aveva il 90%. Si lo so, sono piccoli dettagli, forse anche superflui, ma io da venditore, lo avrei scritto.

L’ayant acheté en mai 2022, je l’utilise depuis. Je peux donc vous donner mon avis.L’iPhone est beau, très peu de rayure. La batterie est correct. Mais il a très souvent dés moments de bug, ou l’écran ce met à ralentir lors de l’utilisation.

Unter generalüberholt mit der Beschreibung Zustand wie neu stelle ich mir etwas anderes vor,ich hatte ein neues Telefon gebraucht also hab ich es so hingenommen aber der Rahmen war leider schon sehr stark verkratzt ansonsten ist das Gerät entsprechend in einen akzeptablen Zustand.Ich denke diese Kratzer auf dem Rahmen sind aber nicht auf den Vorbesitzer zurückzuführen sondern eher auf die Reinigung des Geräts

IPhone 12 Promax annoncé en excellent état vendu  à 939€. Non seulement le téléphone est mal nettoyé mais il présente beaucoup de rayures. Et pour couronner le tout état de la batterie 89%. Après plusieurs tentatives avec Loop Mobile afin qu’ils fassent au moins un geste commercial car le téléphone ne correspond absolument pas à l’annonce, ils m’ont clairement fait comprendre qu’un geste commercial n’était même pas envisageable. J’avais demandé un retour que j’ai dû annulé car je n’ai aucun point DHL à proximité.J’avais confiance car c’est Amazon, mais je regrette vraiment mon achat. Loop mobile est carrément à fuir.

11228,B08PCCKZR7,1,"
Arrivato anche prima del previsto, ero contentissimo della cosa. I problemi sono cominciati da quando l'ho attivato. In poche parole fintantochè non aggiornavo il sistema operativo staccava ed attacava la rete a suo piacimento, passando da nessun servizio a 4G piena in un secondo: questo problema causava una chiusura delle chiamate vocali dopo una media di 15-17 secondi.Eseguo l'aggiornamento del sistema e la rete cellulare praticamente morta e sepolta su nessun servizio. Avvio le pratiche per il reso ma ancora non ho ricevuto risposta dal venditore. Sono andato in un centro apple e mi hanno detto che nonostante il telefono sia internamente che esternamente sia privo di problematiche non si riescono a spiegare il perchè di questo problema.Spero di non dover ricorrere per vie legali dato che il cellulare l'ho acquistato con finanziamento.

Phone was perfect. Only moan was battery at 85% of full workng capacity, but what did I expect with a renewed device eh!
"
11278,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
I bought this as I wanted a phone that was smaller and I am loving it apart from the battery being a little on the low side it more than makes up for it in how pristine the body is very fab phone.
"
11279,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
I've ordered a number of renewed iPhones. They are brilliant. By and large they are as described. But I've had a couple of issues. They just take them back, no quibbles, no issues, and issue a refund. So there's no risk.The first iPhone 12 we received had a column of defective pixels. Went straight back. The next arrived and in absolute mint condition, not a mark in sight, everything working as new, with a 92% battery health. Perfect.Seriously worth buying these considering the savings you make.
"
11280,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
I decided to return phone and get a more up to date one. That said the phone was excellent. I didn’t have it long enough to judge battery life etc. My money was returned promptly. I am very pleased and would buy from them again.
"
11281,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
I’ve never bought a refurbished phone before but will definitely do so again. The phone is in pristine condition with 98% battery health. Really pleased with this purchase
"
11282,B08PCCZ7XT,4,"
As new condition, great battery life and no problems with the phone. Very pleased.
"
11283,B08PCCZ7XT,4,"
Battery life not much better than my old iphone7
"
11284,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Excellent quality, delivered quickly. Very happy with my purchase
"
11285,B08PCCZ7XT,4,"
I bought a phone in excellent condition.  Back on the screen is scratched, which is very visible.  Front Screen without scratches.  The battery is 87%, which disappointed me a lot.  Also, the phone came without a charger and in the tiny box it looks like a letter.
"
11286,B08PCCZ7XT,4,"
I bought this as a second phone for travelling and I almost can’t fault it. Perfect condition (true to description) no scratches, nicks, nothing at all so very happy about that. Everything seems perfect with it functionally so far and I’ll edit this if anything changes. Only thing is it seems like the battery dies faster than it should. It has 86% battery health but if I’m actively using it, it dies fast than my 80% XR. Not a drastic difference but noticeable. Still very good value for money!
"
11287,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
I was a bit sceptical when ordering a renewed phone but I have been very pleased with my purchase and would have no hesitation in recommending, the phone was advertised as excellent condition but I can honestly say it looks brand new.
"
11288,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Was umming and arring about buying a renewed phone online when you can’t see it beforehand but I decided to take a punt and see what happens and I’m glad I did. Phone was in mint condition no scratches or damage to the body or screen at all. Battery was 89% but that’s more than enough considering the price. If your debating buying I’d say it’s worth whatever risk is involved and if your not happy with the condition you can always send it back.
"
11289,B08PCCZ7XT,3,"
So I paid £397 for a iPhone 12 in “excellent “ condition. I must admit I was a little nervous buying a second hand phone unseen as I had never done it before but it is a Christmas present for my son so went ahead. When I received it there is a very obvious long scratch down the centre of the face and several smaller scratches on face of phone. The battery life is 87%. I was going to return it but at this time of year did not want the hassle. I would not buy this kind of purchase online again I’m afraid. I took it into our local mobile shop who concurred it was not “excellent”
"
11290,B08PCCZ7XT,4,"
Phone arrived quickly and was as described. However no charging lead and plug suitable for the phone (they had included a Samsung charger but we had purchased an iphone). Contacted amazon as was an amazon renewed product and they passed me to a 3rd party. I expect amazon to deal with amazon renewed product issues but alas not. 3rd party was pleasant and resolved issue quickly. Overall did take shine off the purchase somewhat though.

Delivered on Wednesday evening and I can honestly say it's no different to a brand new Iphone. Not a mark on it and the battery health is at 90%To say I'm pleased with my purchase is and understatement. When you can get Iphones as pristine as this it makes no sense to pay near to or over £1000.00 for a new one!!I have no hesitation is recommending going down this route to anyone who, like me, wants a new phone but not the costs associated.Brilliant service!!

Battery life disappointing at 83% but phone overall pretty good.

I bought my device from the Mazuma mobile. It came in a generic box with a generic usb-a cable and needle. No papers or original accessories. Device was functional.There were 2 issues with the device but they helped me for both:- The item was not the same as the description (there were some scratches). After my complaint, they ordered a small refund.- 2 months later, the phone's IMEI blacklisted and cellular network stopped. After my complaint, they said the issue is related with the previous customer of the phone. Reportedly they contacted with previous customer and blacklist removed.So, customer service was responsive. However, you should check everything and be a conscious customer.

Can’t comment on battery life not had it long enough but I am sure it will be fine

Excellent condition just like brand new but cheaper price. Won’t ever buy new phone again
"
11305,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
The product was good enough as described in the specifications, maybe the cable could do better with a micro usb, but more importantly the phone is doing great, cheers :)

I had used iPhones since they were first released and loved them from day one. Last year I purchased a Samsung (great phones) but I never mastered the little differences in OS so took a chance on a refurbed iPhone 12. Best thing I've purchased in a while purchased via Amazon, came next day fab condition, couldn't fault it and I'm forensic. Great deal too boot.
"
11307,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Very cheap with vouchers
"
11308,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Great phone
"
11309,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Very pleased with my refurbished iPhone 12 was like new
"
11310,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
My phone is not working
"
11311,B08PCCZ7XT,4,"
Overall a good quality other than a few scratches on the screen and the side’ overall a good product and  Would buy Buy another one if needed.could send in better packaging.
"
11312,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Arrived next working day. Packed really well. No scratches or marks. Looks pristine but only 88% battery life, I had hoped for more. Otherwise really pleased and pretty good value for money. Big improvement on my iPhone 6.
"
11313,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Brilliant could have been brand new
"
11314,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Great phone, good sized screen
"
11315,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Was packaged very well and in excellent condition.
"
11316,B08PCCZ7XT,2,"
Phone looks great, came in what I thought was really good condition.Only use phone mostly for messaging partner and Google maps.Came to realise that the camera is useless. Can’t zoom in on anything very blurry. Doesn’t seem to focus properly, so can’t use video either.Not very impressed, wish I’d bought new.
"
11317,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Was scared it would be bad quality but it’s very good!!
"
11318,B08PCCZ7XT,3,"
Phone arrived quickly but it had no fragile markers on the package and had been pushed through the letterbox onto a stone floor. Fortunately it didn't break.There are a lot of scratches on the screen for a product described in 'as new' condition, and a few chips to the body. The charge cable supplied is not Apple so time will tell how long it lasts. 88% battery health is a little lower than I'd have liked, though it shouldn't be an issue. The phone was not supplied in its original box and did not include any instructions or other information that would normally be supplied with a new phone. Otherwise the phone is fully functional and as desired.The voucher was a nice surprise too!
"
11319,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Item as described, no marks etc, good battery life.
"
11320,B08PCCZ7XT,3,"
I know it’s a rendition phone but there were problems with it like the screen had a orange tinge on the side and when starting up there was a yellow bar across the top of the screen. That would have bugged me.
"
11321,B08PCCZ7XT,4,"
This phone is lighter than my previous XR model, face recognition pretty good. Battery time is still a bit of downer for me as it runs out quick. Cable that came with it, was not particularly great as it is already broken. Overall a great phone, great specs , camera brilliant. Love this mint green colour.
"
11322,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Great product, value for money, nothing wrong with it, delivered really quickly too.
"
11323,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Is excellent Ian very happy
"
11324,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
iPhone 12 exactly as described. Had no scratches and everything worked as new. 98% battery health is really good. To my surprise I like the notch and haven’t missed Touch ID at all. Face ID works well.I preferred the telephoto and standard aspect on the iPhone 8 Plus to the normal and wide on this phone but the image quality is a step up again.I think my Apple Watch drains more quickly with this phone than the 8 Plus, but I do have an original Apple Watch, so that’s probably why.The box from loop mobile protected it well and had everything I needed in it. It may not be an original Apple box, but apart from the initial opening of it when does it matter?Arrived earlier than it said it would, I would look to order from Loop again, maybe a newer Apple Watch…
"
11325,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Just as good as new, no problems
"
11326,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Fantastic phone , looks brand new . A great purchase . Love it !!
"
11327,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Phone arrived early and packaged well not a scratch in sight looks like new really happy great job would recommend to anyone.
"
11328,B08PCCZ7XT,4,"
My title says it all, how can a business be so unprofessional? There was no original box just a white cardboard box, and there was scratches everyone on the phone.
"
11329,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Very good value, almost as good as new, couple of very small scratches and battery 90%, but lot cheaper than new one, would recommend.
"
11330,B08PCCZ7XT,2,"
Christmas present for my daughter. All seems to work ok, but definitely not excellent condition. Screen is cracked and lots of knocks evident around the camera with what appear to be chips on camera glass. Disappointed!
"
11331,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Bought renewed in excellent condition.Easy set up.  Great pictures.Highly recommended.Excellent service from seller.
"
11332,B08PCCZ7XT,2,"
So, this 'excellent, no cosmetic damage visible from 30cm' condition phone didn't work out for me.  Didn't get as far as switching it on to comment on battery life etc.  Oh well, on to the next one.
"
11333,B08PCCZ7XT,3,"
The product was good except for battery health. It was just 87% and the phone would heat up easily. The charger was not type c charger.
"
11334,B08PCCZ7XT,2,"
Screen quickly scratched from the devastating onslaught of being in a soft empty pocket.  Back appears to be made of glass hewn from crystallised cheese.  My old SE lived 5 years without a scratch.  Bit cack really
"
11335,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
I was very worried about buying a secondhand/renewed iPhone, he has so many bad stories but I really couldn’t afford a brand-new one so I took a chance I was so so pleased the quality is fantastic it looks new the battery is 92% which is excellent lasts all day with use Spotify YouTube Facebook et cetera et cetera I am so happy with this product thank you Alison you still have not failed me
"
11336,B08PCCZ7XT,2,"
Advertised as ""new"" but arrived with lots of marks and scratches to the screen.
"
11337,B08PCCZ7XT,2,"
Very disappointed and pissed off. This was bought for a birthday present.. 18th. I felt so embarrassed when it didnt work proprely. As she needed it for college, I had to go out and buy another one in a local shop.
"
11338,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Very pleased indeed with the condition of this, considerably cheaper than new and other than a generic box and power adapter you’d never know it wasn’t new, excellent condition, unblemished screen and a battery health of nearly 90%  I wasn’t sure whether buying a “renewed” item was a good move but it’s been spot on
"
11339,B08PCCZ7XT,4,"
Phone is just like new- really amazing quality, no bumps or scratches at all. My only concern is how hot it gets when using a few apps at a time, especially when using google maps or a similar app. I have to be very conscious to close all other running apps when using. Not sure if this is a general issue or not though!
"
11340,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Luckily covered Apple warranty for almost 8 months. Very good condition and happy with the purchase.Not got the Apple iPhone box, original charging cable. Phone is in great shape though with battery almost 100%.
"
11341,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
The Phone is in perfect working order and great condition
"
11342,B08PCCZ7XT,2,"
Hidden damage means I can’t use it with an audio jack
"
11343,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Buying a second hand phone is always a bit of a risk if you don’t know the supplier. I am very pleased with the phone and would use the company again.
"
11344,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Really nice phone Excellent condition not a scratch on it like Brand-new would bye again from them. Value for money face recognition works fine battery life good thank you very much
"
11345,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Good no scratches and looks brand new. 88% battery life. Arrived quickly too
"
11346,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
4-5 teeny tiny marks on the top edge of the phone and a very very fine scratch on the back of maybe 2mm, but so small you need to be right up close, within a few centimetres of the phone really giving it a thorough examination. Rest of phone, including screen looks as new. Battery 99%. Came with what looks like an original apple plug and lightning cable (both usb, not usb-c) and sim ejector. All in all very pleased.
"
11347,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Five stars ⭐️
"
11348,B08PCCZ7XT,1,"
I ordered an excellent condition iPhone which in the description states there will be no scratches on the screen. Upon receiving the item, the screen is covered in scratches with a few of them being long and deep. What’s the point in paying extra for excellent condition if it’s barely even ‘acceptable’ condition?
"
11349,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
IPhone arrived in 2 days , came in an unbranded box, sim tool & charger. Screen & body in excellent condition no marks or scratches with  battery health 95%.I used the phone for a week now so far I have not found an issue, I  tested playing video , photos, games and yes even phoned a friend. I not been able to test the wireless charging or Bluetooth earbuds with the phone.
"
11350,B08PCCZ7XT,4,"
phone is good conditionI like the product
"
11351,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Was bought in error not realising it was renewed, seller very good and said they would accept return, phone  on arrival was great so my daughter decided to keep it.
"
11352,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Really pleased with my phone, looks brand new so glad I saved a bit of money by buying second hand with a years warranty included from a trusted Amazon seller. Delivery took a bit longer than expected but seems that was a Royal Mail error
"
11353,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Better than expected battery life not bad, but I use my phone a lot and I ask a lot from it and it don’t disappoints me.
"
11354,B08PCCZ7XT,2,"
I bought one in ""excellent"" condition and got billed. This isn't in excellent condition. It is 89% battery and scratches all around the body. Screen is OK. Haven't tested further. Request immediate refund. Absolutely shame for ""Amazon quality"" selling this with misguided information.I can't believe Amazon has partner with this provider. My trust in Amazon brand has dip considerably. Think twice before you buy.Updated: you will need to pay for the return costs. Avoid this product please.
"
11355,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
If you have the money you are gonna B get better value b in the long. Run  buying an iPhone
"
11356,B08PCCZ7XT,4,"
Phone was exactly as described no issues
"
11357,B08PCCZ7XT,1,"
Bought this for a christmas present for my son, Has dinks and dents in the frame, wasted my time and now have to wait 5-7 days for money back upon return. Beware!
"
11358,B08PCCZ7XT,2,"
Camera outer cover visibly scratched
"
11359,B08PCCZ7XT,1,"
Also the battery life is at 88%! I was not aware of that ?! After what I was charged for the phone I am so unhappy with the product ?
"
11360,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
The phone surpassed my expectations when it arrived. The phone was clean and such good quality, it was as if it was new. No visible scratches and 100% battery health. I also like the packaging! The phone has an amazing camera and great sound quality. Glad it came with a cable too! I’m really glad I bought from this company, rather than getting a new phone from Apple. I’m really happy and I would recommend the phone to anyone.
"
11361,B08PCCZ7XT,1,"
Upon arrival the phone looked as good as new and had 100% battery life.  After transferring data across the phone had no service.  I checked the IMEI and found it to be blacklisted.  Although I asked for replacement a refund was sent (still waiting 3 days on), and prices to buy another phone had increased.  Third party seller was Mazuma.
"
11362,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Excellent condition and speedy service
"
11363,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Almost like new. All works okay other than the iOS can’t analyse the battery health due to an unknown battery part as the message states.
"
11364,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
A very good quality refurbished iPhone 12 mint condition arrived swiftly good value for money . Would purchase from them again.
"
11365,B08PCCZ7XT,1,"
Described as ‘excellent’ condition but numerous nicks around the edges of the phone and the screen has clearly been inadequately replaced as it is bent.Do NOT buy from Loop mobile!
"

The item looked very used with scratches. Item was returned and still no confirmation about my refund.

The phone was delivered quickly enough but I failed within 5 minutes of unboxing.Clearly the device had not been tested prior to dispatch.It’s wasted my time.
"
11383,B08PCCZ7XT,1,"
Phone was badly damaged, scratches, dents visible from much more than 30cm. Old looking phone. Company takes days to respond back to you. Returned phone wanted me to wait another 5 days to see if had stock after waiting a week to get return label and for them to get the phone back.Awaiting refund off Amazon. Avoid at all costs. Purchased a mint phone off Apple which is refurbed, brand new battery and all coverings for 72 more. Full 12 warranty too with ApplePlease avoid, don’t make mistake I made. Selling rubbish, poor phones.

OMG this is a lot to spend on a reconditioned phone don’t they have any quality checking? This is the screen as it arrived. When bought it gave a 30 days money back guarantee but on the order it says we can only return by tomorrow which is the day the phone was supposed to arrive. Luckily it came a day early. On top of that the return address is completely illegible. Son is so disappointed as he spent he saved up for this.

Really annoyed to buy this and find that microphone not working. Took to apple store to run diagnostics and they told me phone had been already looked at by an apple store and same problem reported. Why can’t Phones Direct UK check before issuing ? Real hassle and now have to return.

11400,B08PCCZ7XT,1,"
Came with no phone

The seller gave me a faulty phone and and they should’ve done checks on it before selling it!! 0/5 never again!!

11402,B08PCCZ7XT,1,"
I tried 3 different chips from 2 different brands and none of them worked.
"
11403,B08PCCZ7XT,1,"
I want no association with apple, this was a purchase on my account not for me.
"
11404,B08PCCZ7XT,2,"
Was expecting something with better battery life. 90% suggests this phone is getting old. Apple recommend changing battery at 80% so it’s half way there.Minor scratch on screen.Not really bowled over, it’s cheaper than a new phone but only time will tell if it turns out to be an actual saving over a contract phone.
"
11405,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Great price. Phone has 100% battery health and only 1 micro scratch on the screen. Looks basically brand new :)
"
11406,B08PCCZ7XT,1,"
Warning, proceed with caution.  The phone I received had a faulty microphone and clearly had not been checked.  Took a few weeks to receive the refund, so not worth the hassle really compared to buying new.
"
11407,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
I’ve had this phone for 5 months now I still haven’t seen an issue with it. It works like a brand new phone. I’m amazed.

There's a little scratch on the screen. Also, finger prints readable somehow require a couple of attempts to recognise.

11413,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
this phone is in new condition. Unmarked with 100% battery life.A day late in arriving but that was a courier problem, not the companies fault.highly recommended and will deal with again going forward.

I owned a iPhone 11 and think it's time to upgrade to iPhone 12, but when I first received it was not impressed, after fully charges, a bit overheats and the camera is poor quality, my iPhone 11 better than these, so the next day I requested to return for full refund! I’m really disappointed in this product. getting a refund.
"
11416,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Was great quality,a good price and it arrived very quickly!

Very good quality phone!
"
11418,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
This product was in perfect quality no scratches at all even when i looked very close and 100% battery life. I would recommend this product to anyone as it was good value and good quality.
"
11419,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
I can't say enough about this phone, as, in the header, it is like a brand-new iPhone. The battery charges to a full 100%, which I find is a problem many people find buying from anywhere else, some only charge to 80%, but not mine. I haven't found anything yet that doesn't work as it should, I cannot praise this seller enough, it's a brilliant piece of kit.
"
11420,B08PCCZ7XT,4,"
iPhone 12 reconditionné en parfait état. Le profit n’avais aucune rayure, on aurait dit un neuf. Mais après 3 mois d’utilisation je me suis rendu compte que je captais mal la 4 g et qu’elle était de mauvaise qualité. Aussi l’état de santé de ma batterie est passé de 100 a 90 % en 3 mois. La qualité chimique de la batterie m’as donc tout l’air d’être faible. Apart cela, très bon produit avec une super qualité.
"
11421,B08PCCZ7XT,4,"
Lievi inestetismi sulla scocca posteriore a livello delle fotocamere e dei lati, qualche graffio impercettibile sul vetro frontale, ma nulla che non mi aspettassi. La batteria all’85% mi ha un po’ deluso peró bisogna ammettere che era stato specificato in descrizione che le batterie erano dall’85% in poi (pensa che sfiga proprio a me doveva capitare il requisito minimo). Ho pagato a rate Cofidis. Per il resto é tutto normale, nessun danno di sistema. Poteva essere incartato meglio e la puntina per accedere al vano sim non c’era.
"
11422,B08PCCZ7XT,4,"
Sono rimasto soddisfatto dell’acquisto. Presenta segni di caduta e sfregamento solo intorno alle fotocamere, sennò sarebbe stato come nuovo esteticamente. Non sono uno che ne fa un grande uso di social o programmi che stressano la CPU, quindi la batteria al 90% non è un ostacolo per me, ma comunque sarà sufficiente per la maggior parte degli acquirenti.
"
11423,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Handy wie neu, nur gaaanz winzige Gebrauchsspuren - mit bloßen Auge nicht zu erkennen, Batterie 99%, Panzerglas, Ladegerät, Schnelle Lieferung, 100% zu empfehlen - WOW

L’iPhone est bien mais un soucis d’écran tactile et la batterie maximal 86% pourtant j’ai pris «très bonne état » mais caaVa
"
11425,B08PCCZ7XT,4,"
Compre el teléfono en estado excelente. De aspecto está casi como nuevo, tan sólo tiene unas pequeñas marcas en el marco.Las pegas que veo son la salud de la batería que está al 85% y siendo de estado excelente me esperaba que estuviera algo mejor y por último, viene sin caja original y con un cargador y cable del chino…
"
11426,B08PCCZ7XT,4,"
Ich hatte erst angst das ich schrott gekauft hab aber ich war echt überrascht das handy hat kein einzigen krazer und sieht toll aus leider ust dur akkukap. Bei 86%  und ust unverpackt nut in Folie angekommen alles in einem bin ich aber zufrieden
"
11427,B08PCCZ7XT,4,"
Arrivato in tempi previsti.La batteria è al 99% vediamo nel tempo come si comporta , unica pecca un graffio sullo schermo che non rispecchia la descrizione di prodotto eccellente ( che prevede che non si vedono segni evidenti a meno di 30 cm di distanza ). Il resto sembra funzionare tutto a dovere . Non do 5 stelle per il graffio . In ogni caso consiglio l’acquisto
"
11428,B08PCCZ7XT,4,"
Bonjour j’ai reçu le portable 2 jours après la commande ça rien à dire, le téléphone a seulement des chtons en haut et en bas sur le cadre aluminium, état de la batterie à 96%, au bout de 3 jours elle est descendu à 95%, tout fonctionne pour l’instant parfaitement bien, livré avec chargeur complet mais qui n’est pas de chez Apple, une coque transparente de qualité médiocre et un verre trempé pareil de qualité médiocre, mais ça protège pour l’instant c’est le principal. Voilà

Il telefono é arrivato prima dei tempi stabiliti (e di questo vi ringrazio) ho contattato il venditore per un problema di indirizzo ed é stato pronto nel darmi una corretta soluzione. iPhone è perfetto in tutte le sue funzioni e nell’estetica. Che dire soddisfattissima

All'inizio ero molto titubante vista la spesa da sostenere: comprare un rigenerato su internet oppure no?Vista la dipartita del mio precedente telefono mi sono deciso ed ho proceduto con l'acquisto.Sono molto soddisfatto.Il packaging dell'oggetto è veramente misero ma, a mio avviso, ininfluente ai fini della valutazione: ho comprato un telefono non la scatola che lo contiene.Per cui, vista la mia esperienza, vi consiglio il venditore.

Das Telefon hat als generalüberholtes Gerät ein sehr gutes Äußeres:- der Bildschirm ist makellos- Das Gehäuse hat einen winzigen Kratzer in einer Ecke, sonst fehlerfrei- technisch funktioniert alles wie bei einem NeugerätEinziges Manko:- die Batteriekapazität beträgt nur noch 80 %.Ein baugleiches anderes Gerät, was zwei Jahre im Dauerbetrieb ist, hat 88 %. Daraus schließe ich dass dieses Gerät mindestens drei Jahre alt sein dürfte.Wegen dieser 80 % max. Kapazität Bewerte ich das Gerät in Summe als „gut“ und mit vier Sternen.(Da 80 % für mich die akzeptable Grenze ist, habe ich das Gerät nicht umgetauscht.)

Telefono arrivato puntuale,ben imballato, dentro la confezione oltre alla presa e filo per caricare (la batteria dura tanto) anche una cover trasparente e la protezione vetro, i 2 graffietti sotto sono talmente piccoli che neanche si vedono.....buon acquisto lo consiglio

Il telefono si presenta in maniera quasi perfetta per quello sono contentissimo ma la durata della batteria è veramente scarsa per l’autonomia quindi sono piuttosto deluso per il prezzo che l’ho pagato. Mi aspettavo una batteria più fresca. Credo sarò costretto a farla sostituire… spero non a mie spese

Ho preso per la prima volta un iphone per provare un sistema diverso rispetto ad un android e l'ho trovo molto intuitivo, semplice e veloce. E' arrivato con un giorno di anticipo rispetto al previsto e apparte qualche ammaccatura leggera nei bordi della scocca del telefono ( cosa prevedibile in quanto comprato ricondizionato con dicitura buono e non eccellente) perfettamente funzionante, veloce e e in buone condizioni. Qualità prezzo ottimo, il più conveniente rispetto a tutti gli altri. Assolutamente soddisfatto dell'acquisto fatto!
"
11439,B08PCCZ7XT,4,"
Spedizione molto veloce (nonostante non fosse Amazon), arrivato un giorno prima del previsto.Condizioni: eccellenti e ho notato un leggero e quasi impercettibile graffietto (davvero minuscolo) sulla parte bassa dello schermo e lo stato della batteria era dell’84% (e speravo di avere una percentuale più bassa, ma purtroppo no, su amazon le condizioni “Eccellenti” assicurano dall’80% dello stato della batteria in poi).Per il resto veramente tutto perfetto, é il mio primo iPhone e penso non sarà assolutamente l’ultimo e sono onestamente felice di aver abbandonato Android.Perché passare da Android ad iOS?- stabilità nel sistema- aggiornamenti precisi e che sicuramente copriranno il dispositivo per parecchi anni (di media 4).- applicazioni ed integrazioni perfettamente ottimizzate con il dispositivo- se ormai (come me) vi siete annoiati nello smanettare con un telefono e della personalizzazione totale ve ne frega poco allora questo potrebbe essere anche un altro motivo per passare ad iOS, ma attenzione, iOS permette tranquillamente una bella parte di personalizzazione ma sempre fino ad un certo punto.

Durée de vie de batterie à 85% autant dire que dans un an il faudra changer… déception mais rentre dans leur condition de vente 80% minimum.

Alors que c’est une erreur de description de produit !

"
11443,B08PCCZ7XT,4,"
Ottimo prodotto. Il cellulare non ha neanche un graffio. L’ unica cosa che mi ha dispiaciuto un pó: un cellulare con lo stato “eccellente” dovrebbe avere uno stato di batterio superiore a 90%. (mi è arrivato con 85%) Peró, di sicuro mi prenderó un altro cellulare ricondizionato.
"
11444,B08PCCZ7XT,4,"
Questo smartphone non ha bisogno di presentazioni, quindi non dirò nulla su aspetti tecnici o cose simili. Quello che è importante sottolineare, a mio avviso, è la qualità di un prodotto ricondizionato come questo che comunque richiede un esborso economico non indifferente per le tasche della maggior parte delle persone. Quindi il dubbio è sempre lo stesso: prendere un prodotto ricondizionato risparmiando qualche centinaia di euro o fare un ulteriore sforzo e prenderlo nuovo.Ho preso questo telefono per mia figlia quasi adolescente, era da tempo che voleva un iPhone, visto che quasi tutte le sue amiche ce l'hanno. Alla fine ho ceduto ma col patto di spendere al massimo una cifra intorno a 500 euro. Così è stato,  ho preso questo iPhone 12 ricondizionato a 555 euro. Il giudizio sul prodotto è assolutamente positivo. Il telefono è praticamente nuovo, non ha un minimo grasso, nessun difetto di assemblaggio, la batteria dura tranquillamente una giornata. Assolutamente nulla da dire.Il telefono arriva in una scatola non originale con cavo e caricabatteria non originale.Dopo un mesetto ho dovuto cambiare il cavetto in dotazione con un altro da 3A/20w.Consiglio l'acquisto di questo prodotto.

Acquistato ricondizionato ma l’articolo si presenta in perfette condizioni. No graffi, no ammaccature, schermo nuovo e no imperfezioni.

Ero molto neutro a comprare un telefono ricondizionato ma il prezzo mi ha convinto, l’ho comprato e devo dire che sono contento, batteria arrivata al 89% (buono secondo me, poteva essere di meno) e il telefono in uno stato praticamente perfetto, solo una piccola graffa nello speaker però neanche si vede se non lo sai. Il telefono è anche arrivato qualche giorno prima della data di consegna prevista, cosa molto positiva.L’unica cosa che direi come parte non molto positiva è il fatto che lo schermo non sembra di essere quello originale, e per questo non metto 4 stelle. Spunta un messaggio in impostazioni che dice ciò, però, come ho detto prima, per il prezzo sono soddisfatto perché comunque funziona perfettamente. Sinceramente lo comprerei di nuovo.

Para el uso que le doy (redes sociales, cámara, juegos) no tengo ninguna queja. Ni siquiera la batería está tan mal como pensaba (me vino al 85% de salud). Lo único es que tenía algunas mejores expectativas en la calidad de la cámara, por ejemplo a contraluz o a oscuras no me ha llegado a convencer, pero fuera de eso, si se tiene una buena iluminación realmente no tengo quejas, ninguna.

Prodotto arrivato una prima volta con un problema alla batteria, servizio clienti ottimo perchè me lo hanno ritirato e riparato in tempi brevissimi. Purtroppo però ho comprato un telefono in condizioni eccellenti (come da descrizione non dovrebbero esserci graffi visibili oltre i 30 cm) ma lo schermo presenta molti graffi nei bordi abbastanza visibili. Una stella in più perchè la batteria è al 100%.

 Ho acquistato questo Iphone 12 blu (128Gb) ricondizionato in condizioni ""eccellenti"" al prezzo di 660€. Le condizioni sono molto buone, ma è comunque presente un leggero segno sul pannello posteriore (come da foto) e lo schermo è perfetto (forse addirittura nuovo). La batteria risulta essere al 89% della capacità massima.Il prodotto ovviamente è ottimo, ma per condizione ""eccellenti"" mi sarei aspettato una batteria con capacità > 90% e nessun segno sul pannello posteriore (soprattutto considerando il costo pagato).Per questo motivo non do 5 stelle... Segnalo inoltre che nella confezione era addirittura presente un vetro protettivo e una cover trasparente (sorpresa molto gradita).Se ritieni utile questa recensione, sarebbe carino un pollice all'insù.Grazie

Comprato come usato in condizioni ""Eccellenti"" ma sono evidenti graffi sugli angoli superiori ben visibili, non ben pulito e batteria con poco più 80% di massima carica. Schermo integro con proteggi schermo già applicato. Per un telefono pagato circa il 25% meno di uno nuovo sorge il dubbio se ne è valsa la pena. La spedizione gestita come da aspettativa, ma confezione semplice con imballo protettivo un pò semplice. Ho acquistato da poco Phone usato da società tedesca che lo ha spedito in una confezione e packaging simile all'originale e in condizioni da quasi nuovo con lo stesso sconto. Ci sono ampi margini di miglioramento nella gestione dell'usato imparando da altri.

Calidad precio es aceptable. Lo único malo es que lo compre en condición excelente y muestra arañazos a mas de 30cm de distancia, no al revés como decía la publicación ya que no tenia que verse ningún arañazo a mas de 30cm. Cumplieron lo de la batería, que su vida útil (capacidad) es mayor al 80%. La pantalla si me puso un poco a dudar ya que pienso que no esta bien ensamblada porque se puede apreciar que se sale del marco muy ligeramente y si le aplico un poco de presión se observa que se hunde un poco.De resto me funciona todo bien, cumplieron casi como estaba descrito en la publicación.Lo recomiendo si no quieren gastar mucho mas y si no les importa ciertas características quitando los rasguños puede valer la pena para algunos.Mirarlo bien!

Ya me hacia falta cambiarme de teléfono, y pensé en uno que sea calidad/precio como este IPhone. Reacondicionados es una lotería, pero a mi al menos este IPhone me ha salido en muy buen estado. A parte de que llevo buscando este IPhone hace tiempo porque me gusta bastante. En general muy alegre por la compra, ya que el teléfono únicamente me ha venido con un pico en un lateral que apenas se ve el pico ya que es pequeño. Y el porcentaje de la batería está a un 98% a si que bien, si baja rápido estos días lo comentaré.

Inizio dicendo che il prodotto mi è arrivato in ottime condizioni, non nella sua scatola originale ma in una targata ""loop"" con il cavetto originale e addirittura con un caricatore non originale ma nuovo, il prodotto ripeto si presenta molto bene, nessun graffio evidente e nessun tipo di danneggiamento vario, anche lo schermo risulta immacolato e ben tenuto, la batteria nel mio caso era al 99% ma devo segnalare che dopo nemmeno 3 mesi la percentuale è scesa al 95%, personalmente cerco di preservare il più possibile la batteria, ovvero non farlo scaricare oltre il 20% e non farlo caricare oltre 80% (sarà arrivato 5 volte al massimo al 100% e 5 volte sotto il 20% ma mai sotto il 15%, il dispositivo è sempre stato caricato con il caricatore originale della Apple da 20W, quindi valutate voi se è normale questo aspetto. Altra nota dolente è la fotocamera che da qualche giorno ha iniziato ad avere degli artefatti all'interno delle fotografie o video scattati in presenza di poca luce o con un fonte luminosa piazzata frontalmente, oltre a questi problemi devo dire che il telefono funziona davvero bene, nel caso il problema della batteria e della fotocamera dovessero divenire ancora più marcati valuterò se fare il reso. In fin dei conti direi un buon 7.5, magari sono stato sfortunato io.[AGGIORNAMENTO]Segnalo che da giugno la capacità della batteria è scesa fino al 90%, questo a mio parere denota che la batteria molto probabilmente è stata sostituita con una non performante o non originale.[AGGIORNAMENTO 2]Segnalo che la luminosità dello schermo in alcune situazioni diventa davvero bassa, nonostante la luminosità automatica sia disattivata e inoltre non si può alzare e questo comporta che sotto il sole non si veda assolutamente nulla, credo che questo problema sia dato da una sorta di surriscaldamento del dispositivo.Se hai trovato utile la mia recensione sarebbe bello se lasciassi un bel 👍

*Edito porque ha habido cambios en la bateria.La batería llegó con una salud del 97% y a los 11 días está al 95%. Lo cargo únicamente por la noche ya que me llega a final del día sin problema, pero me sorprende que esté bajando la salud tan rápido.Una de las lentes ha venido con varios arañazos, me lo han pulido y ya apenas se ven.Como curiosidad añadir que el iPhone es importado y no decía nada en la descripción, pero todavía no sé si eso podría afectar en algo actualmente o en un futuro en Europa, así que no sé si puede ser algo beneficioso o perjudicial.

C'est la première fois que cela m'arrive et j'en suis très déçu. Il y a eu un réel problème de communication entre Chronopost, la Poste et l'expéditeur sur le colis. Les informations n'étaient pas les mêmes pour chacun. Ce qui a fait que je me suis retrouvé avec un remboursement alors que j'avais bien reçu mon téléphone. Ce téléphone qui d'ailleurs était en parfait Etat comme je l'avais commandé. Aucunes rayures, qualité au top, et batterie à 100 !!! Mon téléphone faisait la journée complète et remplaçait l'ancien qui beug énormément. Mais que je dois reprendre aujourd'hui car je me retrouve contraint de rendre le téléphone acheté. Et pour ces gros problèmes de communication je suis déçu. J'ai acheté ce téléphone durant le black friday et je dois le racheter aujourd'hui, avec un prix plus conséquent... Ce qui est impossible pour un étudiant comme moi.

Il telefono è arrivato sano, con tutte le parti funzionanti però si vede che non è pari al nuovo, nonostante io abbia scelto la categoria A, è arrivato graffiato ai lati della fotocamera e leggermente graffiato sulla parte finale del cellulare anche se non si nota molto.La batteria era dell'88% dunque tra un anno dovrei già cambiarla.Consiglio se non si vuole spendere molto ma tuttavia non vi aspettate chissà che.

Il telefono è arrivato oggi rispetta la condizione eccellente il telefono è arrivato come nuovo, speravo nella batteria più del 90% mi è arrivato un 88% comunque vediamo nel tempo per ora tutto ok.

Se non sapessi che è stato ricondizionato, potrei credere che sia nuovo. Lo smartphone in pratica non ha un segno che possa farmi pensare che sia stato usato, anche la batteria dalla durata sembra nuovo. Consigliatissimo!!!

Due scalfiture (di cui una abbastanza evidente; vedi foto) sulla scocca ed una percentuale di batteria già all’ 88% (per un telefono uscito 2 anni fa) non mi permettono di essere soddisfatto.

J'achète un iPhone 12 blanc 128Go reconditionné avec la mention ""Excellent état"". On paie plus cher pour ça, et d'après les critères du vendeur : ""Corps : aucun signe de dommage cosmétique lorsqu'il est tenu à 30 centimètres de distance"". Sauf qu'on voir des tas d'impacts sur les anneaux de protection des obkectifs photo, même à 1m de distance !Également, des traces collantes (probablement laissées par une ancienne protection de mauvaise qualité) sont mal enlevées.Enfin, la batterie était usagée (capacité 79%, « à réparer » affiché sur le téléphone ) au lieu des plus de 80% garantis.Pour les traces, ça va encore, mais les anneaux abîmés, c'est clairement pas dans les critères ""Excellent état"" du vendeur 😡Je vais renvoyer cet article, et je changerai mon évaluation en fonction de ce qui se passe ensuite…

J’ai acheté cet IPhone 12 bleu 128 go, l’écran a visiblement été  changé car le joint du carter n’est pas bien positionné. Le principal problème est que le haut parleur du haut a commencé par grésiller et maintenant il ne fonctionne plus!!! Impossible d’entendre quoi que ce soit, impossible d’entendre un correspondant ni aucun son…Très déçu !!!Amazon ne me propose ni échange ni réparation seulement remboursement sachant que pour en acheter un nouveau cela me coûterait plus cher ! Incompréhensible sachant que le produit est garantie un an…

Ne ho comprati due uno bianco è uno nero (il bianco ha dei graffi) arrivati senza scatola chiusi in una busta delle lettere, cavetto troppo grosso per caricarli devo levare la cover!  comprati a marzo a distanza di 4 mesi la batteria è scesa a 96% e il nero devo ricaricarlo più volte al giorno si scarica velocemente! Batteria non affidabile per niente ho chiesto il reso meglio comprare un prodotto nuovo.

Acquistato Iphone 12 128 gb il 22 Novembre, prezzo molto competitivo per un dispositivo in condizioni ""eccellenti"" che poi si è rivelato tutto il contrario. Il dispositivo infatti presentava ammaccature molto visibili sulla scocca da oltre 30 cm di distanza (al contrario di quanto scritto sul sito) e lo schermo presentava dei graffi ben visibili anche senza tenere il dispositivo controluce. Inoltre presa lightning e altoparlante frontale sporchi con presenza di polvere, non il massimo per un dispositivo che dovrebbe essere testato e ripulito.Nemmeno configurato, effettuerò il reso. Spero sia stato solo un caso perchè il prezzo era ottimo e la spedizione sempre al top su amazon.

Compre el producto aproximadamente el 5 de agosto en estado excelente, a dia de hoy, 28 de noviembre ha bajado un 7% la salud de la bateria (Ya vieniendo con algunas marcas de uso y un 94% de salud), algo bastante raro que baje tan rapido no dandole mucho uso dia a dia (llego al final del dia con aprox un 45% y lo pongo a cargar con el cargador proporcionado, supuestamente compatible, y no dejandolo por la noche), hoy me encontrado con la sorpresa de que casi se podria haber quemado el escritorio porque el cable proporcionado (supuestamente, certificado por MFi) a empezado a echar humo.Aparte de todo esto, el movil es la versión de EEUU (a2172), que no deberia ser un problema en cuanto a las bandas, aunque el 5G no ha funcionado correctamente (teniendo antena cerca de casa y comprobado con la misma SIM en un movil 5G [Mi10T] ).En cuanto al resto, vino bien empaquetado, sin la caja original (no es problema).Se pide la devolución, ya que no termino de fiarme de que el terminal este en buen estado o no el indicado despues de haber pasado un tiempo de prueba bastante extenso.

Pessima esperienza: ho acquistato due iPhone 12 in condizioni ""eccellenti"" che mi sono pervenuti con schermi non originali e di cattiva qualità, nonostante la descrizione dell'oggetto parli solo della possibilità di accessori (e non componenti) non originali - problema non da poco dato il prezzo pagato. Una volta contattato, il venditore non sembra aver dato alcuna importanza al problema.
"
11565,B08PCCZ7XT,3,"
Inizio col dire che è un ricondizionato a metà e questo perché è indecente avere un telefono che è stato testato e rimesso a nuovo ma con un auricolare gracchiante. Impossible fare telefonate se non con l'auricolare e poi gli audio di WhatsApp a volte manco si sentono bisogna riavviare l'App. Oltretutto il telefono scalda in una maniera allucinante soprattutto quando si ricarica in wireless. Meno male che c'è la garanzia Amazon renewed perché farò sicuramente il reso

Il telefono mi è arrivato con un graffio sulla fotocamera posteriore ,mentre quella anteriore anche se la pulisco mi trasmette l’immagine sempre e comunque sfocata sul display ,apparte questi due problemi che mi infastidiscono il telefono è praticamente quasi  nuovo peccato che in oltre dopo un po’ di giorni che lo sto usando ho notato che una cassa audio non va e l’hot spot non si può attivare per via di Danni tecnici
"
11573,B08PCCZ7XT,1,"
Telefono arrivato in anticipo, tutto perfetto fino all'accensione. Ho notato subito che la cornice nera era stranamente spessa (più del mio iPhone 12 originale) e che il lato inferiore era addirittura più spesso degli altri, decentrando così l'immagine. Allora con il dubbio che si trattasse di un ricambio ho guardato più attentamente e ho visto che la nitidezza delle scritte era decisamente peggiore. Finita la configurazione ho avuto la conferma nelle impostazioni dove è riportato che lo schermo è una parte sconosciuta, probabilmente non originale.Capisco la necessità di ricondizionare telefoni con schermi danneggiati, ma mi metti un display cinese sgranato e lo spacci anche per A+?State attenti ai dettagli.

Nel giro di pochi mesi il telefono ha iniziato ad avere degli spegnimenti improvvisi e alla riaccensione il livello della batteria era cambiato dal 90 al 20% , mai una caduta , sempre trattato con perizia , gli ultimi giorni ha smesso di ricevere la carica e restava acceso al 1% solo se collegato , ma senza andare oltre quella percentuale  . Sulle impostazioni messaggio di errore che avvisa che la batteria non è originale e forse proprio per questo è durata così poco , assurdo per un telefono pagato 640 euro e tra l’altroregalato . Chiesto reso e oltre il danno la beffa perché dovrò restare una settimana o forse più senza telefono perché avrò rimborso solo dopo che il venditore riceverà l’oggetto.
"
11582,B08PCCZ7XT,1,"
eigentlich sollte ich ein Foto mit einstellen. Das Gerät habe ich jedoch dirket wieder verpackt und retourniert. Dieses Gerät als ""ausgezeichnet"" für 550 Euro zu verkaufen ist eine bodenlose Frechtheit. Das Gerät hat noch nie eine Schutzfolie gesehen, außerdem ist der Vorbesitzter wohl mit einer Ecke an einer Hauswand entlang geschlittert oder es viel aus entsprechender Höhe auf den Asphalt. Total abgeranzt. Sowas hab ich noch nie geschafft mit meinen Smartphones, welche mal gestürzt sind.Dass Amazon für sowas seinen/ihren Namen hinhält ist kaum zu glauben. Ich habe kein Neugerät erwartet aber das Teil gehört eigentlich entsorgt. Unglaublich, unterirdisch, für dumm verkauft oder inkompetente Mitarbeiter. Nie wieder generalüberholt.

Venditore raccomandato! Il telefono (acquistato in condizionino eccellenti) sembra a tutti gli effetti nuovo, ad eccezione della batteria 89%,comunque dura tutta la giornata se lo si usa normalmente.Pare funzioni tutto alla perfezione , in caso aggiornerò la recensione

11584,B08PCCZ7XT,2,"
il telefono è arrivato 2 settimane prima della data prevista, quindi il venditore è stato davvero efficiente; peccato che abbia dovuto restituirlo perchè l'audio all'orecchio e in vivavoce era basso, non regolabile e disturbato. ok invece quello in cuffia. Il telefono dal punto di vista estetico era in condizione perfette

Telefono arrivato con bordi ammaccati ma lievemente, schermo non compatibile con il dispositivo, surriscaldamento estremo della batteria (non usabile per più di 5min) andava a fuoco, cristalli liquidi scadenti, microfono mal funzionante. Tutto questo risolvibile, ma venditore mi ha accusato mi aver fatto danni, quando io ho inviato subito foto e prove subito all’arrivo del telefono. Scortese e maleducati. Per me non sono dei venditori terzi a cui affidarsi. Avevo chiesto aiuto a loro e mi hanno detto di aspettare 14 gg, così da farmi perdere la garanzia A-Z Amazon. Per fortuna non ho aspettato e sono stato rimborsato. Amazon affidabile. LOMBARDO SHOP VERAMENTE EVITABILE
"
11588,B08PCCZ7XT,5,"
Prodotto arrivato in anticipo, non nella scatola originale di iPhone ma in una scatola del venditore, senza auricolari ne alimentatore (per non è un problema perché avevo già un iPhone e userò quelli), ma il telefono è in ottime condizioni, non ha un graffio sembra nuovo. Se vogliamo trovare un difetto la batteria è al 90% ma essendo ricondizionato ci sta. Venditore consigliato, perché ho letto  recensioni dello stesso prodotto ma di altri venditori e quasi tutti si lamentavano di segni di usura.

El móvil que recibí estaba impoluto por fuera, únicamente tenía unas marcas en el cristal mínimas. Lo único que tuve que devolverlo debido a que se reiniciaba constantemente y había momentos que se quedaba la pantalla en negro y no encendía. El servicio postventa no me dio ninguna opción a la hora de comentárselo y que me mandaran otro y hacerme otro tipo de compensación, me dijeron mándalo y te reembolsamos el dinero, lo que demuestra dejadez por su parte y poco buen trato hacia el cliente. Por esto le pongo una estrella.

Venditore scorretto!Ho preso un Iphone12 ricondizionato (in ottime condizioni estetiche) ma dopo nemmeno un mese ha smesso di funzionare senza apparenti motivi, senza subire ne cadute ne urti.Amazon mi ha autorizzato il reso per garanzia ma l'assistenza del fornitore rifiuta il rimborso o sostituzione perchè nella cover mi ci è venuto un graffio. E per un graffio mi invalidi la garanzia di questo grave malfunzionamento?  Intanto il cellulare non funziona più.Roba da vergognarsi! Venditore sconsigliato!

Telefono pieno di graffi sulle fotocamere, ammaccature sul bordo del telefono e memoria al 90% e considerato che ho acquistato il telefono allo stato eccellente mi è impossibile accettare questi compromessi.Ho fatto il reso e cosa peggiore in tutto questo è che in 5 giorni che l'ho fatto non hanno ancora controllato in che stato si trova(l'ho usato letteralmente 5min) e non mi hanno ancora fatto il reso.Servizio clienti imbarazzante!

Acheté en ""Excellent état"", pour rappel Amazon annonce comme critères :""Écran : aucune rayure, Corps : aucun signe de dommage cosmétique lorsqu'il est tenu à 30 centimètres de distance.""Le téléphone présente pourtant une rayure bien visible sur l'écran et la peinture autour des deux objectifs photo est écaillée. Les deux défauts sont visible au premier coup d'oeil donc le vendeur est soit incompétent soit malhonnête, aux choix.Pour ce qui est de la batterie je ne peux pas me prononcer. Je ne suis pas allé jusqu'à l'allumer, il est retourné directement dans sa boite.En attente de remboursement.

Abbiamo ordinato un telefono nero ed è arrivato blu ma siccome era urgente (abbiamo pagato anche la spedizione) poichè mia figlia studia fuori città ed era senza telefono, lo abbiamo tenuto, comprando una cover nera;-). Dopo 20 giorni non riconosce più la SIM (che provata nel mio telefono funziona). Abbiamo chiesto la sostituzione, speriamo siano rapidi (mia figlia è a casa una settimana) e che stavolta.. funzioni. È vero che è rigenerato ma costa quasi come nuovo. Peccato, la telecamera è valida e per 3 settimane è stato un buon telefono.

En mi caso, el teléfono vino con la cámara delantera estropeada. Por fuer atenía algún rasguño pero no pude ni iniciarlo xq no me funcionaba el reconocimiento facial. Lo devolveré en lo que pueda, estoy esperando que me conteste el vendedor.

El teléfono llegó en aparente buen estado. La pantalla estaba cambiada, pero al ser reacondicionado, es algo comprensible. Sin embargo, a la semana de usarlo, falló el Face ID y he tenido que devolverlo. Tal y como he leído en otros comentarios, quizá deberían revisar algo mejor los teléfonos reacondicionados antes de venderlos, pues es una auténtica lotería. El servicio de logística por parte de Amazon para la devolución y resolver dudas, inmejorable. Me acabo de comprar uno nuevo para no llevarme más sustos. XD

Non capisco perché mi è stata cancellata la precedente recensione.Quindi la riscrivo: l'iPhone 12 verde vednuto da RG RENT è tutto graffiato con un graffio importante sulla fotocamera anteriore/face ID. A volte nn riconosce il FaceID e se metto una pellicola il FACE ID non viene proprio riconosciuto e quindi sono costretto ad usare il codice di sblocco o a rimuovere la pellicola!L'ho comprato perché c'era la dicitura: condizioni eccellenti. Non chiedevo un iPhone nuovo di zecca, ma almeno uno con pochi graffi e un pò più nuovo. Ho gia richiesto il reso. Lo comprerò da un altro venditore

Ho scritto al venditore ancora senza risposta, l’iPhone che ho ricevuto ieri pomeriggio ha il frame in alluminio con profonde ammaccature e graffi, il che è molto lontano dalla descrizione “nessun segno di imperfezione a distanza di 30cm”, sono segni visibili anche a 1m (purtroppo). In queste condizioni un iPhone nuovo scontato è un’opzione più dignitosa.

Rapporto qualità prezzo direi basso/molto basso, si paga un iPhone ricondizionato 100€ in meno rispetto al nuovo e ti arriva con la scocca rovinata su tutti gli angoli, lo schermo è ok, ma sinceramente mi aspettavo molto di meglio.Mi ritengo deluso dall’acquisto, e consiglio di non fidarsi troppo della descrizione del prodotto “difetti estetici non visibili da 1 metro” mi sembra un po’ una presa in giro, i difetti si vedono, da ben più di 1 metro

Ich hatte mich sehr auf das Handy gefreut und konnte kaum auf die Lieferung warten.Ich bin zutiefst enttäuscht gewesen als ich die grüne elektrische Linie am Display sah. 😲Ich meine das Handy kostet gerade nicht wenig und man hätte sich bisschen Mühe bei der Überprüfung des Handys und der Verpackung geben können.Bevor das Handy ankam habe ich das passende Panzerglas und die passende Hülle gekauft was mir etwa 40€ gekostet habe, und selbst die haben mich mehr Freude gemacht als das Handy.Nun habe ich das Vertrauen verloren und leider nicht zu empfehlen.🥲

Even though I bought this through Amazons' Warehouse, the iPhone had little to no dents or scratches apart from a slight scratch at the top antenna area (doesn't matter since everyone including me rocks these phones with a case). A great phone just like it's predecessors.
"
11749,B08L5SRBZ7,4,"
There's no doubt that this is a really good phone, and I'm lucky to have it. It was a compromise though - I wanted the third lens on the camera because I take a lot of pictures, but would honestly have preferred the iPhone 12 Mini for size - screens are so good these days they really don't need to be huge. So I knew what I was getting. Upgrading from the 64Gb on my old phone to 256Gb is great, although it still filled up immediately until I changed the settings back to optimising photo storage. At least now I've got enough room not to worry about apps and so on. There are some things I preferred about the older generation of phones but we're never going back, and quite a few things that are still better with Android (price for one), but I can't really imagine anyone ever being disappointed with this as a choice.
"
11750,B08L5SRBZ7,5,"
More than happy with my phone. Big memory. Takes great clear photos. Fits nicely in my handbag. Lots of recording space for voice memos. Very secure with face recognition. Lots of useful apps and games. This from the women who is not techno savvy. It goes everywhere with me. I’ve saved a fortune on sat nav for the car. I just downloaded a Waze app and I’m off! Battery lasts long and charges quickly. Definitely would recommend. My daughter bought hers after mine because she was impressed with it and she is very tech savvy!
"
11751,B08L5SRBZ7,4,"
Not much to say
"
11752,B08L5SRBZ7,5,"
The 12 Pro is the best iPhone ever produced. It’s a massive improvement over previous iPhones and the camera is breathtaking! Night time photography brings out a whole new world of possibilities. Difficult to believe but two of the pics I have posted were taken in the dark, the third is a portrait pic of my Jug Lola. I just don’t know how Apple manage to do this in such a small package but it’s amazing. Then I discovered the Lidar camera....OMG! It has to be seen to be believed. Yes, it is pricey but I’ve been a huge fan of Apple phones and this one does not disappoint. You may want to wait for the Pro Max but that will be more expensive and way bigger.
"
11753,B08L5SRBZ7,5,"
Great phone but the camera is superb . Thought good and hard about buying due to the cost but was sold on it after one day of using the camera. I’m a keen photographer but didn’t want to carry camera everywhere. Using this more than my camera .Great zoom and video too.
"
11754,B08L5SRBZ7,5,"
I upgraded from my iPhone X to get the 5G capability. I went for the Pro version because really my phone has replaced my camera now and the iPhone 12 Pro has a very good camera with a much better low light capability.Performance-wise I haven't noticed any big advantage over the iPhone X, although I don't play games or anything that would require a particularly fast processor.I noticed that the handy auto-lock feature has been removed. On my previous iPhone, closing the folio case would lock the phone and, similarly, opening it would unlock it again. A useful feature that I miss.it's a well made Apple phone and I have no hesitation in recommending it.
"
11755,B08L5SRBZ7,4,"
Decent phone, well made and easy OS to use. Came from Android but I’m a techie so no issue getting used to new phone.Price is a little high since you can get most of these feature on different phones, but you won’t be disappointed in buying this phone. If you’re unsure between iPhone 12 or 12 Pro. I’d recommend just getting the iPhone 12 not much in them just pro get extra telephoto lens.
"
11756,B08L5SRBZ7,5,"
I love the pacific blue colour, looks so much better in real life than on pictures.  Amazing camera, so much better than my previous iPhone X. Night mode is great. However, due to pandemic and travel restrictions I cannot yet use the phone to it’s potential. The screen is stunning, however I’m still getting used to the slight size difference. Battery is good but not great. Personally I would have gone for iPhone 12 Pro Max but the size is off putting. I would give 4,5 out of 5 stars because of the battery. The phone lasts through the day when using it for emails from morning till evening. Streaming is another question...
"
11757,B08L5SRBZ7,5,"
This phone is your typical iPhone with some extra features. In all, very nice. Upgraded it from my 11 pro. The speakers are much better so it’s nicer to listen to music without putting your headphones. In  general, everything is similar to the previous phone but it does have some nice new features.
"
11758,B08L5SRBZ7,5,"
I love the design and feel of the phone. It reminds me of my iPhone 4. I’m not a fan of apples iOS system, I prefer googles stock android operating system. Unfortunately google design is lacking so I went for the iPhone 12pro, I didn’t want the Max version as it to big for comfort in the pocket.I definitely prefer this design over the X and XS.I was really pleased with the option to buy over 5 instalments. Amazon make it too easy to buy.

I bought the phone hoping it would be a very good upgrade in comparison from my current 11 pro, however after trying my friends iPhone 12 pro and not being overly amazed with the new features I decided to make a return as I feel its not worth the upgrade. If you are upgrading from an iPhone x or below, I would say that its worth it, however from an 11 or 11 pro its not worth it after trying out my friends iPhone 12 pro.

Amazon had it priced £250 lower than Apple so had to give it a go. Been using for ~1 week now. Can’t fault it apart from battery not being the best imo. The same usual comfort straight out of the box with iOS. The plug not being in the box wasn’t an issue. Flat edged are back and damn they feel nice.  If you love the comfort of iOS and haven’t upgraded in a while then this should be the phone for you

Upgraded from the 7 plus. I was really excited to get the new iPhone as I’ve wanted to upgrade for a while but put off by the price tag. First impression was “oh, that’s it” I expected it to be bigger. It was smaller than my 7 plus, looked more square like an old IPhone 4 but heavier. Straight away, the first thing I noticed was how yellow the screen was so I turned off the auto brightness and messed with a few other setting but was still annoyed by how yellow and dull it looked. I tried taking the same photos with the 12 pro and my 7 plus and actually preferred the colour and quality of my old phone’s photos. I even emailed myself the photos to have on the device to ensure it wasn’t just the yellowness of the screen that made them look bad and it wasn’t. Not impressed at all and not worth the money so I have returned my first ever iPhone.

I recently wanted to purchase a new phone due to my current IPhone 7 slowing down and freezing. This new purchase of the IPhone 12 Pro has been absoultely incredible and I’m so glad I waited for this model.- fast speed- insane quality, pics etc- great battery lifeI would highly recommend! Apple has done it again - thank you so much ❤️

I'm not sure any phone is worth a grand. It was for my daughter and I'm reliably informed that it's a darn fine phone. However, long live Android!

Among this year’s iPhones. Perhaps the pro is the least “pro” one. The regular 12 is just as good in all key aspects including screen and camera, which divided the 2 models last year. However this doesn’t mean the pro is not worth the extra, apple has clearly put more thoughts in the colour and material. Still love it! Btw the max is just huge.

11765,B08L5SRBZ7,5,"
I love iPhones and don’t mind paying the price. I could have gone for the cheaper 12 but wanted the 12 Pro. Facial recognition is great and saves a lot of time. The battery life on this 12 Pro seems much better than my previous 8 but battery life does erode with time. I love this phone.

Great phone that really is a improvement on my old iPhone se2020. I have had this for 2 months and I’m quite happy.However I am not impressed with the amount of times I have to turn this phone off to re-boot because everything freezes.Everything else in the house works fine with my WiFi.This is also the situation when I am out and about.I have a full signal but am constantly having to turn the phone off for a few minutes and then on again.I never had to do that with my old iPhone se 2020 .Not worth the money in my opinion.Update. 19-8-2021Phone still freezes. iOS is up to date. My iPad Pro 9.7 (a few years old now)  never seems to have a problem when I am home, this phone does. beginning to wonder if it is a faulty phone. next stop is to go to a apple store and see if there is anything they can do, but as things are im not impressed. i need to reboot once a day.watch this space.Update. Totally useless constantly. Regularly freezes and fails to connect to the WiFi. I thought this may be my router but the other items all connect without a problem. Waste of money. Avoid

The only problem would be the iPhone box itself was dented. There were however no issues with the phone. I ordered another iPhone with this one which never came but that's an entirely different issue.
"
11770,B08L5SRBZ7,5,"
Love the phone, upgraded from an X. Still overpriced in my opinion. The battery life is not markedly different from my old X. Interesting to see if it maintains the level of battery capacity over the next years.
"
11771,B08L5SRBZ7,3,"
You can't deny, apple really do provide a premium product and hands down win against Samsung when compared to over all finish however when using this I couldn't help but think that my previous phone was better. This resulted in sending the phone back and sticking with my Samsung s20 ultra. I don't think I could get over the huge camera notch and the refresh rate on the display was just not amazing. I'll probably return to apple when these issues are resolved.
"
11772,B08L5SRBZ7,5,"
Fantastic phone (as expected!!)... feels like the old 5C generation phone to hold, only heavier... so not as comfortable in hand as my XR but the camera quality is spot on which is what I wanted the pro for. Good value as I bought from Amazon Warehouse so saved £160 off retail price.

It’s a simply brilliant  phone, the best so far. I had a 3G, 4S, 6+, 7+, X, SE2, and this is miles ahead of them all in so many ways. The triple camera takes stunning photos and it’s a powerful device in every other respect, never mind it looks stunning.

As an apple sheep after watching the October event I was excitedly waiting till this iPhone could come back in stock.I even had to cancel my previous order as I was told by Amazon customer services that it would take at least 1-2 months to arrive! What a disappointment.Even worse so, when I ordered this iPhone once it came back in stock it arrived with faults! I can’t use the network capabilities on the phone and use a sim thus I am going to return this device ASAP. This might be a one-off unit but beware of defective units.

Apple is an expert at spinning phones from functional machines into desirable, aesthetically-honed status symbols, and the iPhone 12 Pro is a prime example of a device you probably don’t need but will definitely want.The front of the phone is covered in what Apple calls “Ceramic Shield,” a hybrid of glass and ceramic. Between the new material — you can’t call it “glass” because it’s technically not glass — and the new design, Apple claims the iPhone 12 line has four times better drop performance than the previous models, with the same scratch resistance. (I drop my phone a lot, so I’m excited to see how this goes.) On the back, you’ll find the same type of glass as last year, but the new design should improve its drop performance as well,Apple says.One thing Apple would not tell me is how resistant this stainless steel frame is to nicks and scratches…The main camera has a very slightly brighter lens than last year, which helps it in low light, and Apple’s new Smart HDR 3 processing seems to be, well, a little smarter. The noise reduction is improved and looks better than the iPhone 11: photos look less grainy, and there’s a little more detail. The photos are also slightly more contrasty; every year, Apple seems to be more willing to let highlights be highlights and shadows be shadows, which is a look I’m personally fond of.The back of the phone features Apple’s new MagSafe magnetic wireless charging and mount system, which feels like the connector equivalent of the summer before college for the first time: the future is bright and exciting, and you get to reinvent your whole situation from scratch. But the days of the Lightning connector are obviously coming to a close, and it’s okay to be sad about it.MagSafe is extremely clever as a concept and exceedingly fine in reality. I am excited about magnetic car mounts and stabilizer gimbals and other accessories that don’t require fiddling to attach.

After befriending various power outlets around the house with my iPhone 7, I decided to upgrade to this.It’s good, the cameras good and it makes calls.It’s heavy, it has that annoying paint on the frame you know full well that after a few blurry nights will scratch up nicely..... as you don’t get a charger get a decent wall charger and the wireless apple charger.... £35 was the cheapest I found.If like me you have watched your phone bounce off the ground a few times you will want a case and a screen thingie, it weighs the same as a small ship so a car should offer the ground some protection.5G is alive and well in there too, but that’s the network people not this shiney brick tbh.The camera’s are the reason you got here ( or you realised the S20 is not the same as the US version you see in the adds) it’s good, it’s very good... I can often be found out and about with a bag full of lenses and my DSLR, or with a 8k camera precariously stuck to my drone, so can happy Saturday as an ‘all the kit and no clue’ brigade it’s pretty amazing.Battery appears to be in there too, lasts ages so could possibly be magic of some kind.Safety is something I’m glad to say Apple has built in to this new device. Your £1200 looks mighty pretty to some undesirable types, but now you can simple batter then with this metal brick. Nice one you wonderful greengrocers.Ts waterproof ish, they say 6m however they fail to explain how you are meant to have a call at that depth, this could prove disastrous if tried. Besides if you’re diving and still need to answer calls, then perhaps  it’s time to reevaluate your life work balance.It has a torchlight, it reminds me of this often with a nice blinding light when my fat fingers press the wrong bit, that or it hates me.Sadly on the down side, none of my pets have yet to add teeth marks yet. As such I’d say this device makes a rubbish rabbit toy

I have purchased iPhones since the first model. This is a great phone but the battery life compared to my last iPhone 11 Pro is shockingly bad. I was getting 2 days from my 11 Pro, but barely get a day from this new 12 Pro, and I'm not a gamer either. Just be warned.
"
11840,B08L5SRBZ7,5,"
It’s an amazing phone, these are some of its quality:- 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display;- Ceramic Shield, tougher than any smartphone glass;- A14 Bionic chip, the fastest chip ever in a smartphone;1Pro camera system with 12MP Ultra Wide, Wide and Telephoto cameras; 4x optical zoom range; Night mode, Deep Fusion, Smart HDR 3, Apple ProRAW, 4K Dolby Vision HDR recording;- LiDAR Scanner for improved AR experiences, Night mode portraits;- 12MP TrueDepth front camera with Night mode, 4K Dolby Vision HDR recording;- Industry-leading IP68 water resistance- Supports MagSafe accessories for easy attachment and faster wireless charging;- the battery it’s really good, if you use it all day you gonna end the day with 20%, if you don’t use it that much you will end the day with 50/60% of battery;- The 3 cameras are amazing, you can take some amazing photos even in dark thanks to the lidar sensor witch helps the focus of the cameras;- The chance to edit video on this phone really open a word of possibility for people that enjoy these things;At last I would recommend this phone to a new iPhone users for an amazing experience and to iPhone users who has a model holder then the Xs.

This device requires two hands to operate correctly due to the ""swipe up from bottom"" feature. Switching between apps with one hand is torture and my hand hurts after only 10 min of using the new phone. Gripping the phone lower so that I reach the bottom part easier makes it very difficult to hold it and I dropped it while trying to figure out how Apple expects me to hold the phone so I can reach the very bottom of the screen.I switched to this from an iPhone 7 MAX, which I could use confortably with one hand from day 1!The phone is nice, the camera seems to be really good, but unless you need a better camera and you are ok with using two hands on the phone most of the time, I recommend sticking to the older models that have a home button, or switch to Android.
"
11844,B08L5SRBZ7,5,"
Upgraded from the 11 Pro and am very happy with it. Camera is far better and the screen is much brighter. A14 chip is blazingly my fast compared to the 11 Pro. The design looks good and the phone is easy to hold. Might be just me but I find it heavier and the 11 pro and also one hand use is out of the question now. If you’re happy with the 11 Pro there is no need to get this, but if you are using anything XS or below, hand over your cash to Apple RIGHT NOW!!!
"
11845,B08L5SRBZ7,5,"
Upgraded from iPhone X and it was definitely worth it! Improvement in speed (A14 processor)and massive upgrade in camera department. Photos are excellent! Pricey, but it's a premiumsmartphone and it's worth it. iOS is another reason to go for it, much more stable than Androidwhich crashes more often. Good job Apple!

I just couldn't believe when I received the box. It was very slim. Where did they put the charger?Answer: They didn't.Apple doesn't provide chargers anymore. The official excuse ( that no intelligent person will believe) is ""we are ""saving the environment. ""The real reason is that people at Apple found a. new way to increase their profits and at the same time pretend they care about the environment.People who are buying an iPhone for the first time (how many millions? ) will have to buy either a normal charger and pay £20 for it  or buy  a mag safe and pay £40.  It will add environmental cost of shipping and more boxes. If anything, Apple is managing to cause more damage to the planet by not adding a charger to the box. But as long as their profits grow, they dont' care. And they will be selling far more chargers and mags now than they ever did before.People who had a Samsung, for example, and are changing to iPhone will also have to buy a charger.It's shocking to see so many five stars reviews about  a phone which doesn't have a charger.Then again,  as the saying goes, ""there is a s... born every minute"" .  S.... who  buy a phone without a charger and praise it to high heavens.Meanwhile, Apple is counting the extra money they are making with chargers and MagSafe.

Although it shows usually dispatched within 1-2 months, it actually faster than expected. I order this new phone 5 days ago and it delivered today. I was expected it’s gonna take few weeks but just 5 days. The Pacific blue is beautiful in hand. Upgraded from 7plus to 12pro is a great improvement. Speaker sounds loudly and camera is amazing. Especially when I took the video it’s not shaking like 7plus did. Faster response and bigger screen, very good experience.

So, I had just brought this phone a good two months ago and I have never been so pleased with a phone before. I had come from a Samsung S10e and if any of you knew that phone, you would know it is a small and very compact phone. My battery life on the Samsung was really bad, so I had decided to get an iPhone 11. Happy to say that I don't regret buying it.I had got the initial phone for £480 ish as I brought the 128gb version, since I needed the storage. I have barely used half of the storage too, which is good. The battery is actually good, it goes down gradually as the hours pass, but sometimes I notice that if I keep certain apps like Spotify opened up for a long time, the battery tends to go down faster, but that's probably because I have Spotify on 24/7. However, on a normal day, the battery basically lasts for most of the day.I had a hard time trying to adjust to the new phone and its' new functions, but I had quickly gotten used to it as I used it more and more. Obviously this is common knowledge but I don't like that Apple had gotten rid of the earphone jack. That annoyed me. But the sound is amazing on this phone.The camera is pretty decent too, it feels like I have a professional camera in my phone. The camera has many functions to suit different people's needs when it comes to having a camera in their phone. I have taken some really nice shots with my phone, and my friends could not believe that it came from my iPhone.Not going to lie, I used to be a Samsung fanboy, so I would always put Apple down for their phones and say that Samsung was better. However, that is now the contrary. I am absolutely pleased with the phone, and I know everyone hypes up iPhones, and yeah, to an extent, it shouldn't be hyped up that much, but, in my experience, this is a rock solid phone and I recommend buying it if you can't afford the more newer phones, as it essentially has all of the functions the newer phones have. Additionally, the iPhone 11 will be updated for more years, so that's even more of a reason to buy this phone.

Have had 5 iPhones and 2 iPads and for me the iOS  system on both devices is simplicity for those who struggle with mobile phone technology.My only issues are the battery life and price which are not the best.

After struggling with a 4 year old android phone I decided to take the plunge and buy my first apple phone.There are a few out there and the latest models are quite expensive, I was torn between an iphone 13 mini and a iphone 11 which apple have just stopped making.I decided to buy the older model and save myself £200 and I’m glad I did this because it is just a fantastic phone, it’s very smooth and quick and with so much to do and learn it’s slowly taking over from my iPad.With it being an older model I was a little concerned about how long it would be supported with updates but I believe apple will support this model for at least another 4 yearsIf you have an android phone and thinking about buying a new phone buy this one before supplies run out you will not be disappointed.

I am happy for the phone works perfect thanks

I've had it for a year now, the screen seems really cheap. Got scratched very easily! And the battery dies very quickly now

I bought this to replace an iPhone 7 that I use for work, this is a brand new phone and works as you would expect an Apple device.Do yourself a favour, don't buy a refurbished or renewed iPhone when you can have a new one for such a bargain price.
"
11867,B08L6Z1M4Y,5,"
We love iphone 11, we have in the family other one. The box came closed just like the apple stores. The phone is flawless.
"
11868,B08L6Z1M4Y,4,"
All going well to date, so happy enough with it
"
11869,B08L6Z1M4Y,4,"
Son loved this. Not the most up to date but that makes it more affordable. Big screen for his continuous game play

After waiting for a month to deliver due to supply problems to Amazon , this phone arrived with a software fault hence the low rating . Amazon did refund fast as I didnt want to take tup an option for repair .Have since purchased from another supplyer with 2 day delivery and the replacement is fine and performs well and as expected
"
11871,B08L6Z1M4Y,5,"
Really high quality phone for a reasonably price. You may be able to get another phone with better specs for cheaper however they will not have ios or as many years as software support that you get with apple.

11872,B08L6Z1M4Y,4,"
Lovely phone

iPhone has become the best cellphones in the world, So I bought this as a gift for my mom She recently swapped her old Samsung S8 for this new iPhone and she loves it. It has so many benefits it just can't go wrong, Once you start using iPhone you're stuck with them forever it has an amazing camera and night mode and a very good screen, you can find so many accessories everywhere. Overall I'm happy with the purchase. The only downside is probably the battery is not the best, but I'm probably being too demanding as I'm comparing it with my iphone 13 pro max.
"
11874,B08L6Z1M4Y,5,"
Bought for my daughter.  She loves it ""more than anything else in the whole world"", so, I guess that's 5 stars from her :-)
"
11875,B08L6Z1M4Y,5,"
This is a legit iPhone. I had my iPhone 8 Plus for 5 years and rlly didnt want to upgrade, but reached the point where I had to. in my research I was quick to find out this this is the most worth it phone atm. its a lot cheaper than I had bought my iPhone 8 Plus for, and it is exactly the same, if not better. apple is a cult, I understand why people want to buy out of it, but other companies don't even come close to them, their phones are slow, glitchy and terrible quality, unless you pay thousands, so better to buy in than suffer from the outside.
"
11876,B08L6Z1M4Y,5,"
If you want to good camera and batery and fit your hands, the phone is right for you. Easy to use and hold it
"
11877,B08L6Z1M4Y,5,"
Cheaper if you purchase the red colored I phones. I saved around £70-00 buy purchasing a red one, compared to grey or black. I also got a phone with more storage because it was red!
"
11878,B08L6Z1M4Y,5,"
very happy with this phone mint condition works perfectly fine I would definitely recommend! :-)

iPhones slightly older model but new enough to carry all the latest features and apps a great phone with lots of memory and new battery life it lasts all dayI got the white model at a huge reduced price and put a black cover on it looks just like a phone costing £200 more

"
11885,B08L6Z1M4Y,5,"
Sure some people complaining cause they don't understand how to charge it lol low IQ people shouldn't be getting iPhone anyway. So far its been awesome and the wide camera mode is very useful. For battery life I'm getting about 10-12 hours of use and when I'm not using  the iPhone the battery % doesn't appear to change. The display has no issues very clear sure its not the best in the world but I can't see any reason for getting a phone with an oled display unless you have that extra £200 spare I'm pretty sure the display is one of the reasons for such long lasting battery life. Overall I say the iPhone 11 black I got is good just make sure the seller you buying it from says amazon warehouse or amazon otherwise you might be buying from some random untruthful third party seller. Pretty sure Apple is still selling the phone on their website as well so you might as well buy it from there. I got same day delivery :p which is one of the reasons I bought my iPhone 11 from amazon.

It was a gift for my daughter she informs me that it is perfect.

My son’s iPhone XR suddenly failed - and was out of its warranty period. A long discussion with Apple revealed it would cost £307 to repair; I decided that would not be worthwhile as this iPhone 11 model cost a little under £600, new and delivered, straight from Apple.The cell phone arrived the very next day after ordering and was well packed for transit. The iPhone 11 is a very good item for the price, not being the latest model means a really good cost saving - and the functionality is very good indeed. My 16 year old son is delighted with his new cell phone and I recommend it.I have just one reservation: Apple does not include the charger (wall adaptor) - only the wire that now has a USB-C connection and so will not fit older Apple adaptors. This is penny pinching on the part of Apple - it only cost £10 to purchase the right adaptor, but beware when ordering.
"
11895,B08L6Z1M4Y,5,"
Rather than renew a contract, we bought the iPhone 11 128gb for our daughter to replace an iPhone 8 64gb.A great phone with plenty of space for apps. No plug or earphones but luckily the 8 cable and ear pods were still usable. I did buy a new plug adapter anyway just in case she needs to use the new cable.Worked brilliantly with their virgin sim card, no issues!Hopefully this handset will have the same life as its previous model, currently 2 1/2 years old and still working well!
"
11896,B08L6Z1M4Y,5,"
It was my first time buying on amazon and i dont regret it at allLove this iphone❤️

Buying for a family member, second one of these I bought in 3 months other one failed to load the sim after 1 month, I tried to persuade him the quality is not good. Took 3 months to get a refund from Amazon - 3 phone calls, number chats and emails later after various promises I finally got it. Phone is way over priced compared to android and then you dont even get a charger or ear buds!This line is like something a comedian would say "" As part of our efforts to reach our environmental goals, iPhone 11 no longer includes a power adapter or AirPods. Please use your existing Apple power adapter and headphones or buy these accessories separately"". What if you don't have an existing apple product? this is ridiculous and should be in bold at the top (Amazon) so people notice it. you cant even plug in a normal set of ear phones into this phone. In reality it should read ""as part of our efforts to make tonnes more money and screw you the purchaser for your last cent, into spending even more money on over-priced poor quality apple white goods, and reach our goal of accumulating more millions of riches for the select few of us at the top table, you will need to buy other things in order to use our core product"" .  Apple and Amazon shame on you both using environmental awareness for obvious profiteering!

Brought this for my daughters birthday as I am so pleased with my Iphone11 , fab camaera and features. Main reason is it has 6.1 inch large screen without being a iphoneplus . Good size screen which i have been using for a number of years now and means i dont need to get my glasses out to read messages etc. Price is good too.
"
11899,B08L6Z1M4Y,5,"
I was a bit sceptical since it’s not a official iPhone and I wanted another colour but since my phone broke I was desperate for a new one and this one was cheaper . Anyways the phone is actually really good and the camera as well , u have to buy ur charger doe
"
11900,B08L6Z1M4Y,5,"
Good
"
11901,B08L6Z1M4Y,5,"
Be honest it’s well priced at the moment, I’ve looked at eBay and music magpie a refurbished one is roughly about £480 give or take.Apple products being Apple we all know what happens to them after the reach a certain age but hey hoo!Face ID really fast , good battery life so far , feels good in your hand, easy to use .No charger ! Buy one no big deal!No air pods my current ones work on it.
"
11902,B08L6Z1M4Y,5,"
Really liked the size of the screen on this itemReally clean finish and my favourite one yet! Will definitely recommend

A great improvement on my iPhone SE (1st edition). Works very well and transferred data in minutes from my old phone.
"

This was another present for my current boyfriend. He's absolutely delighted with it. Seems to do everything he needs it to do and syncs up to the watch no bother. I'm an Android user myself and personally thing apple products are stupidly over priced for the cost that they make them at.
"
11906,B08L6Z1M4Y,1,"
The screen is all scratched. I don’t have time to send it back before Christmas to get another one. It’s for my daughter for Christmas. I will have to get a new screen put on it before I give it to her. Also turned up without a box.

"

Bought as a replacement phone for my mum and she’s getting on with it very very well. The only downside is that it has face recognition in a time we’re wearing masks due to COVID 19 (you have to use your pin instead - unless you have an Apple Watch that will unlock it for you). However this isn’t the fault of the product as this technology works very well under normal circumstances.
"
11913,B08L6Z1M4Y,5,"
The I phone 11 is very nice to look and the battery last up to 2 day if you don’t use it much I use it everyday I was on android but I really like the I phone I can put all my application on this phone

Superb quality iphone as I expected from Apple but, as others have already said, why no charger plug and ear buds !The phone was relatively easy to set up and transferring from my old Android was not a problem.The camera is amazing ! However the lack of essential extras loses Apple one star.
"

I’ve been using apple products for around 8 years. My apple account links this to my iPad. Set up was only a couple of minutes because I was able to click one box to set it up as my old iPhone 6. Passwords photos and preferences were automatically installed. Battery life huge.

Hello there!  I'm very happy with the new iPhone 11.  He is beautiful phone and colour also. I really recommend to anyone. But one single issue is, been so expensive, why on earth does not come with charger. That's all. Thank you very much!!!

Great phone in which I absolutely love so far. It’s so much better than my IPhone 6. Lets just hope the battery lasts longer then 5 years.  The only thing I wish Apple would add to this product is headphones compatible with the phone.

"
11931,B08L6Z1M4Y,2,"
As a first time apple user, i tried to create an apple ID on the phone, but it said that too many IDs have been created on this particular handset so it cannot create anymore. I was under the impression that i was purchasing a brand new phone, so this is quite a surprise. Luckily my android handset created the Apple ID for me.
"
11932,B08L6Z1M4Y,5,"
A very good phone, you know what to expect if youve ever had an iphone.Large bright screen, simple and efficient OS, great battery life and good storage.I got mine as an amazon warehouse deal and months later it is still working perfectly, highly recommend.

If you have an iPhone 8 or below this is the perfect upgrade.

Generally, there will be free shipping if you buy more than 20 pounds. I bought a 500 pounds mobile phone and charged 5 pounds for shipping. It's ridiculous.
"
11940,B08L6Z1M4Y,5,"
Excellent upgrade from IPhone 8 it was worth it. I love the Face ID and bigger screen also great battery life so far. It’s not 5G but by the time I upgrade again I’ll get a 5G iPhone. I’d have liked a plug for the usb c charger.
"

the colour is so pretty and everything is amazing but like usually apple is way too expensive hahah but so worth it
"

I am very disappointed! I have just bought the iPhone 11 and I have just opened it and I realised there are no power charger or EarPods. This is my first iPhone so it doesn’t make any sense! How is possible to sell a phone without charger and EarPods! Only iPhone!!! For sure not recommended at all! Not as a first iPhone as I will have to spend more than £50 to get the charger and EarPods!

I was not so happy from beginning with this phone. It's not responsive,slow and makes simple mistakes.I have to repeat many times to get proper response.It's backward product. If this is a evolution of iPhone I bet many long time customers like myself will turn to other brands. I'm watching Google phones with a interest. If they prove that they are safe and provide highest level of SECURITY definitely I will give a try. Dissapointed user.

.  Outbound speech from the phone is routinely heard as unintelligible static by those on the receiving/listening end.  Taking it to Apple to get it addressed.  In over 10 years of buying iphones directly from Apple for me and my family, the one time I do not and this is my experience 😞

In the middle of the replacement procedure with this phone. Only had it 4 weeks . Bought a case for it and it's been on since first use. This phone has been handled like a new born but its started to reboot itself intermittently and also cannot take videos. Was also annoyed that it didnt come with the USB- C mains plug. Had to purchase a separate plug for £20+

This is my first iPhone. I had actually bought a refurb one a few weeks previously, but decided to return it and buy a brand new one from Amazon. I was prepared to wait 1-2 months for delivery, but luckily mine came just after 2 weeks! (I ordered it on October 1st and received it October 16th, much sooner than expected, so I was very happy!) I think there was a short window a few days when the white 128GB version was available immediately. The refurb one I had bought previously was already two years old with only 85% battery life left, so it was a no brainer to get a new one instead at almost the same price! I think it's still a very good purchase at the end of 2021 with the current price drop - I really only need this phone for Instagram, which is optimised for the iOS. I love the camera with all the gimmicks: slo-mo, timelapse, filters, etc and the availability of all the editing apps. It was very frustrating that my old Windows phone (which I still carry around, by the way) didn't work with any of the creative apps I wanted. So the old adage is true ""If it's not an iPhone, it's not an iPhone"".Update: I thought I would update my review a year on as I'm about to pay off the phone in a few days' time. It's been incredible so far and I never regretted buying it, even though it was a significant expense for me. I will probably use it for years before buying another one. It's still on 100% battery health a year on, even though I use it for hours every day. There are so many apps available that didn't work on my old phone - it's like a whole new world opened up for me! I'm taking and editing  photos and videos for Instagram, playing puzzles and games, surfing the net, using Facetime on the sofa or anywhere in the house instead of having to sit in front of the computer on Zoom. And it's not only for entertainment - I'm also using it for official stuff as well, when I had to prove my identity to get a passport/Covid pass, use my Waitrose vouchers, etc. All of those things would have been impossible to do on my old phone. There's a reason why all the apps work so well on iOS - it's because there are only a handful of iPhone versions for developers to tackle, whereas there is an almost infinite number of different Android devices and not all of them are optimised for every single app. Not to mention my old Windows phone, which is totally useless for any app. If you want to be in the game, you need an iPhone. I just wish they were a bit cheaper, but I guess you get what you pay for.

Bought for wife for present from Apple official online store. At last Christmas we noticed some photo having darker spot. Recently we figured out its always there and visible on light photos only. Apple technician diagnosed dirt on camera lens inside the phone :o It should be clean and is dust proof rated IP68 and yet here we are... It seems that meanwhile in mid January the warranty period expired. Well, be prepared then to pay £90 for internal vacuuming of your phone every time when some debris happen to find way to camera lense or screen. Phone in immaculate state never missused. We found plenty of reports of the same issue in Internet (iphone 11 and other iphone models) but Apple don't want to admit design flaw and does not will to repair free of charge. If you don't wont to risk extra costs then look for other phone or sell it when it's still in warranty period. Not a quality that we expected from Apple or any other devices manufacturer and thats sad as otherwise we were very happy from their products...

Having not owned an iPhone for a couple of years, I found some very minor re-learning curves with using some apps. That’s more of an observation than a criticism. I’ve had many, many phones ranging from flagship Samsung to Motorola and Xiaomi. I feel that Apple whilst overall expensive, you do get what you pay for. They do the basics exceptionally well. I recently tested the Poco x3 which I know is a sub £250 phone, but it struggled with some of the basic things like typing accuracy, apps crashing and face unlock. This iPhone does all of that seamlessly. The look might be a bit dated with the huge cut out but the Face ID is second to none and so fast yet secure. The keyboard flawless and the camera is fantastic which includes night shooting and low light photography. Videos are also top tier and unrivalled...one of my prior concerns was battery. As I have said I haven’t Owned an iPhone for a while and in that time they have massively overhauled the battery life to be excellent. I get regular 7-8.5 hours screen on time which is really strong. As opposed to the older iPhone days of 3-4 hours.... The stereo speakers are loud and balanced and the weight of the phone is heavy but not unwieldy. Negatives are that it’s not as open as Android and customisable and you do not get a charger or EarPods in the box any longer which is poor from Apple who have clearly used this for money saving tactics or money making whichever way you look at it....I purchased a good 18w fast charger for relatively low cost and had some Bluetooth headphones anyways. The phone takes around an hour and half to fully charge. It gets to around 70% quickly within 35-40 mins and then trickles to 90 before literally sipping away the remainder I presume to preserve the longevity of battery life. Overall massively happy with this phone if you can stretch to £650 get the 128gb version and with the years of software updates and fast chipset with power efficient processing this will definitely be a phone to hold onto.

This was a birthday gift for my son. I was bit skeptical for red color but it looks really chic to my surprise. The phone seems to function well too. Happy with my investment

Owned iPhones since the 3s and got to 6s and had it for 3years until the battery died. I thought of going up a couple of grades but settled on the yellow iPhone 11 64g. The photo I’ve included is night mode on the iPhone, just stunning!The Face ID is a terrific bit of security. The sound from the onboard speakers are great. There’s no headphone port. I’ve got wireless headphones and they work perfectly.It’s fast and easy to use. I’d always say buy a case. I bought a rubberised case and a glass screen guard just to protect it. A lightning cable will charge it. I bought a cheap wireless QI charger which protects the port.It’s the biggest phone I’ve had but I love it !

Ok so bought my iPhone 11 direct from Apple as Amazon didn’t have any at the time.  Been really pleased with the phone: camera, battery life, use as a phone !  I would however agree with others, I have a houseful of chargers and to suddenly find that this cable doesn’t fit any of them is really annoying.  Fortunately although my first iPhone it’s not my first Apple product so I have a cable I can use.  Have also found the loss of an auxiliary connection annoying.  I usually use Bluetooth headphones but occasionally I forget to charge them up or I want to connect to a non Bluetooth speaker.  Assume this is the reason why no headphones in the package.But, all in all am really pleased with this phone.

I have had this phone for a few months now and I am more than happy with it, this is the phone everyone needs, great value for money with all the features an iPhone should have. Battery life lasts me more than a day and the switch from Touch ID to Face ID is nothing to be concerned about - Face ID is so much easier to use and more natural.

First of all this is a replacement to my iPhone XR which had many faults. I really like the new iPhone and it works much better than its predecessor. It includes features like live wallpapers and real Haptic Touch and my favourite double camera. If you want an iPhone that is amazing for a good price get the new SE or the XR (Mine was a one off I presume) but if you have more money to spend buy the IPhone 11 or up. Thanks Apple
"
12057,B08L6Z1M4Y,2,"
Great iPhone in every way but one… making and receiving phone calls ! Serious sound issue with a caller to your iPhone 11 hearing intermittent conversation particularly when your speakerphone is used. The only apparent cure is to wear earphones. It’s a very big issue on Apple Communities  and other forums but so far remains unresolved. We are huge fans of Apple products but this one in particular is…‘unsound’ !!
"
12058,B08L6Z1M4Y,5,"
She transported all the stuff from her Apple SE in minutes, to my amazement. The only downside was Tik Tok history which they don’t allow to be downloaded so she keeps this on her previous phone.She loves it.The purchase price saving was great too.

Upgrading from an iPhone 6s to an iPhone 11 is a big jump but totally worth it. Black 32 GB, nice light weight; bigger better screen and colourful display too; the battery. It's definitely an original Apple from Amazon. Only regrets is; I should have taken 128 GB for 50£ more. Overall very good phone absolutely no regrets at all..

Phone was perfect. Only moan was battery at 85% of full workng capacity, but what did I expect with a renewed device eh!
"
12093,B08PCFV74N,5,"
I bought this as I wanted a phone that was smaller and I am loving it apart from the battery being a little on the low side it more than makes up for it in how pristine the body is very fab phone.
"
12094,B08PCFV74N,5,"
I've ordered a number of renewed iPhones. They are brilliant. By and large they are as described. But I've had a couple of issues. They just take them back, no quibbles, no issues, and issue a refund. So there's no risk.The first iPhone 12 we received had a column of defective pixels. Went straight back. The next arrived and in absolute mint condition, not a mark in sight, everything working as new, with a 92% battery health. Perfect.Seriously worth buying these considering the savings you make.
"
12095,B08PCFV74N,5,"
I decided to return phone and get a more up to date one. That said the phone was excellent. I didn’t have it long enough to judge battery life etc. My money was returned promptly. I am very pleased and would buy from them again.
"
12096,B08PCFV74N,5,"
I’ve never bought a refurbished phone before but will definitely do so again. The phone is in pristine condition with 98% battery health. Really pleased with this purchase
"
12097,B08PCFV74N,4,"
As new condition, great battery life and no problems with the phone. Very pleased.
"
12098,B08PCFV74N,4,"
Battery life not much better than my old iphone7
"
12099,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Excellent quality, delivered quickly. Very happy with my purchase
"
12100,B08PCFV74N,4,"
I bought a phone in excellent condition.  Back on the screen is scratched, which is very visible.  Front Screen without scratches.  The battery is 87%, which disappointed me a lot.  Also, the phone came without a charger and in the tiny box it looks like a letter.
"
12101,B08PCFV74N,4,"
I bought this as a second phone for travelling and I almost can’t fault it. Perfect condition (true to description) no scratches, nicks, nothing at all so very happy about that. Everything seems perfect with it functionally so far and I’ll edit this if anything changes. Only thing is it seems like the battery dies faster than it should. It has 86% battery health but if I’m actively using it, it dies fast than my 80% XR. Not a drastic difference but noticeable. Still very good value for money!
"
12102,B08PCFV74N,5,"
I was a bit sceptical when ordering a renewed phone but I have been very pleased with my purchase and would have no hesitation in recommending, the phone was advertised as excellent condition but I can honestly say it looks brand new.
"
12103,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Was umming and arring about buying a renewed phone online when you can’t see it beforehand but I decided to take a punt and see what happens and I’m glad I did. Phone was in mint condition no scratches or damage to the body or screen at all. Battery was 89% but that’s more than enough considering the price. If your debating buying I’d say it’s worth whatever risk is involved and if your not happy with the condition you can always send it back.
"
12104,B08PCFV74N,3,"
So I paid £397 for a iPhone 12 in “excellent “ condition. I must admit I was a little nervous buying a second hand phone unseen as I had never done it before but it is a Christmas present for my son so went ahead. When I received it there is a very obvious long scratch down the centre of the face and several smaller scratches on face of phone. The battery life is 87%. I was going to return it but at this time of year did not want the hassle. I would not buy this kind of purchase online again I’m afraid. I took it into our local mobile shop who concurred it was not “excellent”
"
12105,B08PCFV74N,4,"
Phone arrived quickly and was as described. However no charging lead and plug suitable for the phone (they had included a Samsung charger but we had purchased an iphone). Contacted amazon as was an amazon renewed product and they passed me to a 3rd party. I expect amazon to deal with amazon renewed product issues but alas not. 3rd party was pleasant and resolved issue quickly. Overall did take shine off the purchase somewhat though.
"
12106,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Received phone and it was like new. Really pleased with it
"
12107,B08PCFV74N,5,"

"
12113,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Ordered my Iphone 12 on Tuesday afternoon and crossed my fingers that the phone that arrived would be in good condition. Delivered on Wednesday evening and I can honestly say it's no different to a brand new Iphone. Not a mark on it and the battery health is at 90%To say I'm pleased with my purchase is and understatement. When you can get Iphones as pristine as this it makes no sense to pay near to or over £1000.00 for a new one!!I have no hesitation is recommending going down this route to anyone who, like me, wants a new phone but not the costs associated.Brilliant service!!
"
12114,B08PCFV74N,4,"

I bought my device from the Mazuma mobile. It came in a generic box with a generic usb-a cable and needle. No papers or original accessories. Device was functional.There were 2 issues with the device but they helped me for both:- The item was not the same as the description (there were some scratches). After my complaint, they ordered a small refund.- 2 months later, the phone's IMEI blacklisted and cellular network stopped. After my complaint, they said the issue is related with the previous customer of the phone. Reportedly they contacted with previous customer and blacklist removed.So, customer service was responsive. However, you should check everything and be a conscious customer.

I had used iPhones since they were first released and loved them from day one. Last year I purchased a Samsung (great phones) but I never mastered the little differences in OS so took a chance on a refurbed iPhone 12. Best thing I've purchased in a while purchased via Amazon, came next day fab condition, couldn't fault it and I'm forensic. Great deal too boot.

Overall a good quality other than a few scratches on the screen and the side’ overall a good product and  Would buy Buy another one if needed.could send in better packaging.
"
12127,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Arrived next working day. Packed really well. No scratches or marks. Looks pristine but only 88% battery life, I had hoped for more. Otherwise really pleased and pretty good value for money. Big improvement on my iPhone 6.
"
12128,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Brilliant could have been brand new
"
12129,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Great phone, good sized screen
"
12130,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Was packaged very well and in excellent condition.

12131,B08PCFV74N,2,"
Phone looks great, came in what I thought was really good condition.Only use phone mostly for messaging partner and Google maps.Came to realise that the camera is useless. Can’t zoom in on anything very blurry. Doesn’t seem to focus properly, so can’t use video either.Not very impressed, wish I’d bought new.
"
12132,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Was scared it would be bad quality but it’s very good!!
"
12133,B08PCFV74N,3,"
Phone arrived quickly but it had no fragile markers on the package and had been pushed through the letterbox onto a stone floor. Fortunately it didn't break.There are a lot of scratches on the screen for a product described in 'as new' condition, and a few chips to the body. The charge cable supplied is not Apple so time will tell how long it lasts. 88% battery health is a little lower than I'd have liked, though it shouldn't be an issue. The phone was not supplied in its original box and did not include any instructions or other information that would normally be supplied with a new phone. Otherwise the phone is fully functional and as desired.The voucher was a nice surprise too!
"
12134,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Item as described, no marks etc, good battery life.
"
12135,B08PCFV74N,3,"
I know it’s a rendition phone but there were problems with it like the screen had a orange tinge on the side and when starting up there was a yellow bar across the top of the screen. That would have bugged me.
"
12136,B08PCFV74N,4,"
This phone is lighter than my previous XR model, face recognition pretty good. Battery time is still a bit of downer for me as it runs out quick. Cable that came with it, was not particularly great as it is already broken. Overall a great phone, great specs , camera brilliant. Love this mint green colour.
"
12137,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Great product, value for money, nothing wrong with it, delivered really quickly too.
"
12138,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Is excellent Ian very happy
"
12139,B08PCFV74N,5,"
iPhone 12 exactly as described. Had no scratches and everything worked as new. 98% battery health is really good. To my surprise I like the notch and haven’t missed Touch ID at all. Face ID works well.I preferred the telephoto and standard aspect on the iPhone 8 Plus to the normal and wide on this phone but the image quality is a step up again.I think my Apple Watch drains more quickly with this phone than the 8 Plus, but I do have an original Apple Watch, so that’s probably why.The box from loop mobile protected it well and had everything I needed in it. It may not be an original Apple box, but apart from the initial opening of it when does it matter?Arrived earlier than it said it would, I would look to order from Loop again, maybe a newer Apple Watch…
"
12140,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Just as good as new, no problems
"
12141,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Fantastic phone , looks brand new . A great purchase . Love it !!
"
12142,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Phone arrived early and packaged well not a scratch in sight looks like new really happy great job would recommend to anyone.
"
12143,B08PCFV74N,4,"
My title says it all, how can a business be so unprofessional? There was no original box just a white cardboard box, and there was scratches everyone on the phone.
"
12144,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Very good value, almost as good as new, couple of very small scratches and battery 90%, but lot cheaper than new one, would recommend.
"
12145,B08PCFV74N,2,"
Christmas present for my daughter. All seems to work ok, but definitely not excellent condition. Screen is cracked and lots of knocks evident around the camera with what appear to be chips on camera glass. Disappointed!
"
12146,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Bought renewed in excellent condition.Easy set up.  Great pictures.Highly recommended.Excellent service from seller.
"
12147,B08PCFV74N,2,"
So, this 'excellent, no cosmetic damage visible from 30cm' condition phone didn't work out for me.  Didn't get as far as switching it on to comment on battery life etc.  Oh well, on to the next one.
"
12148,B08PCFV74N,3,"
The product was good except for battery health. It was just 87% and the phone would heat up easily. The charger was not type c charger.
"
12149,B08PCFV74N,2,"
Screen quickly scratched from the devastating onslaught of being in a soft empty pocket.  Back appears to be made of glass hewn from crystallised cheese.  My old SE lived 5 years without a scratch.  Bit cack really
"
12150,B08PCFV74N,5,"
I was very worried about buying a secondhand/renewed iPhone, he has so many bad stories but I really couldn’t afford a brand-new one so I took a chance I was so so pleased the quality is fantastic it looks new the battery is 92% which is excellent lasts all day with use Spotify YouTube Facebook et cetera et cetera I am so happy with this product thank you Alison you still have not failed me
"
12151,B08PCFV74N,2,"
Advertised as ""new"" but arrived with lots of marks and scratches to the screen.
"
12152,B08PCFV74N,2,"
Very disappointed and pissed off. This was bought for a birthday present.. 18th. I felt so embarrassed when it didnt work proprely. As she needed it for college, I had to go out and buy another one in a local shop.
"
12153,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Very pleased indeed with the condition of this, considerably cheaper than new and other than a generic box and power adapter you’d never know it wasn’t new, excellent condition, unblemished screen and a battery health of nearly 90%  I wasn’t sure whether buying a “renewed” item was a good move but it’s been spot on
"
12154,B08PCFV74N,4,"
Phone is just like new- really amazing quality, no bumps or scratches at all. My only concern is how hot it gets when using a few apps at a time, especially when using google maps or a similar app. I have to be very conscious to close all other running apps when using. Not sure if this is a general issue or not though!
"
12155,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Luckily covered Apple warranty for almost 8 months. Very good condition and happy with the purchase.Not got the Apple iPhone box, original charging cable. Phone is in great shape though with battery almost 100%.
"
12156,B08PCFV74N,5,"
The Phone is in perfect working order and great condition
"
12157,B08PCFV74N,2,"
Hidden damage means I can’t use it with an audio jack

12158,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Buying a second hand phone is always a bit of a risk if you don’t know the supplier. I am very pleased with the phone and would use the company again.
"
12159,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Really nice phone Excellent condition not a scratch on it like Brand-new would bye again from them. Value for money face recognition works fine battery life good thank you very much
"
12160,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Good no scratches and looks brand new. 88% battery life. Arrived quickly too
"
12161,B08PCFV74N,5,"
4-5 teeny tiny marks on the top edge of the phone and a very very fine scratch on the back of maybe 2mm, but so small you need to be right up close, within a few centimetres of the phone really giving it a thorough examination. Rest of phone, including screen looks as new. Battery 99%. Came with what looks like an original apple plug and lightning cable (both usb, not usb-c) and sim ejector. All in all very pleased.
"
12162,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Five stars ⭐️
"
12163,B08PCFV74N,1,"
I ordered an excellent condition iPhone which in the description states there will be no scratches on the screen. Upon receiving the item, the screen is covered in scratches with a few of them being long and deep. What’s the point in paying extra for excellent condition if it’s barely even ‘acceptable’ condition?
"
12164,B08PCFV74N,5,"
IPhone arrived in 2 days , came in an unbranded box, sim tool & charger. Screen & body in excellent condition no marks or scratches with  battery health 95%.I used the phone for a week now so far I have not found an issue, I  tested playing video , photos, games and yes even phoned a friend. I not been able to test the wireless charging or Bluetooth earbuds with the phone.
"
12165,B08PCFV74N,4,"
phone is good conditionI like the product
"
12166,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Was bought in error not realising it was renewed, seller very good and said they would accept return, phone  on arrival was great so my daughter decided to keep it.
"
12167,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Really pleased with my phone, looks brand new so glad I saved a bit of money by buying second hand with a years warranty included from a trusted Amazon seller. Delivery took a bit longer than expected but seems that was a Royal Mail error
"
12168,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Better than expected battery life not bad, but I use my phone a lot and I ask a lot from it and it don’t disappoints me.
"
12169,B08PCFV74N,2,"
I bought one in ""excellent"" condition and got billed. This isn't in excellent condition. It is 89% battery and scratches all around the body. Screen is OK. Haven't tested further. Request immediate refund. Absolutely shame for ""Amazon quality"" selling this with misguided information.I can't believe Amazon has partner with this provider. My trust in Amazon brand has dip considerably. Think twice before you buy.Updated: you will need to pay for the return costs. Avoid this product please.
"
12170,B08PCFV74N,5,"
If you have the money you are gonna B get better value b in the long. Run  buying an iPhone

"

Bought this for a christmas present for my son, Has dinks and dents in the frame, wasted my time and now have to wait 5-7 days for money back upon return. Beware!
"
12173,B08PCFV74N,2,"
Camera outer cover visibly scratched
"
12174,B08PCFV74N,1,"
Also the battery life is at 88%! I was not aware of that ?! After what I was charged for the phone I am so unhappy with the product ?
"
12175,B08PCFV74N,5,"
The phone surpassed my expectations when it arrived. The phone was clean and such good quality, it was as if it was new. No visible scratches and 100% battery health. I also like the packaging! The phone has an amazing camera and great sound quality. Glad it came with a cable too! I’m really glad I bought from this company, rather than getting a new phone from Apple. I’m really happy and I would recommend the phone to anyone.
"
12176,B08PCFV74N,1,"
Upon arrival the phone looked as good as new and had 100% battery life.  After transferring data across the phone had no service.  I checked the IMEI and found it to be blacklisted.  Although I asked for replacement a refund was sent (still waiting 3 days on), and prices to buy another phone had increased.  Third party seller was Mazuma.
"
12177,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Excellent condition and speedy service
"
12178,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Almost like new. All works okay other than the iOS can’t analyse the battery health due to an unknown battery part as the message states.
"
12179,B08PCFV74N,5,"
A very good quality refurbished iPhone 12 mint condition arrived swiftly good value for money . Would purchase from them again.
"
12180,B08PCFV74N,1,"
Described as ‘excellent’ condition but numerous nicks around the edges of the phone and the screen has clearly been inadequately replaced as it is bent.Do NOT buy from Loop mobile!
"

The phone was delivered quickly enough but I failed within 5 minutes of unboxing.Clearly the device had not been tested prior to dispatch.It’s wasted my time.
"
12198,B08PCFV74N,1,"
Phone was badly damaged, scratches, dents visible from much more than 30cm. Old looking phone. Company takes days to respond back to you. Returned phone wanted me to wait another 5 days to see if had stock after waiting a week to get return label and for them to get the phone back.Awaiting refund off Amazon. Avoid at all costs. Purchased a mint phone off Apple which is refurbed, brand new battery and all coverings for 72 more. Full 12 warranty too with ApplePlease avoid, don’t make mistake I made. Selling rubbish, poor phones.

OMG this is a lot to spend on a reconditioned phone don’t they have any quality checking? This is the screen as it arrived. When bought it gave a 30 days money back guarantee but on the order it says we can only return by tomorrow which is the day the phone was supposed to arrive. Luckily it came a day early. On top of that the return address is completely illegible. Son is so disappointed as he spent he saved up for this.

This is a quality product at an affordable price. Like new, fully functional.
"
12204,B08PCFV74N,1,"
Disappointing to see so many chips - this phone has had a bit of a history.  Compounded by the screen simply not working.  All I had was a torch - not worth £473.99 then.

Slow and bad condition phone...Returned
"
12214,B08PCFV74N,1,"
Really annoyed to buy this and find that microphone not working. Took to apple store to run diagnostics and they told me phone had been already looked at by an apple store and same problem reported. Why can’t Phones Direct UK check before issuing ? Real hassle and now have to return.
"
12215,B08PCFV74N,1,"
Came with no phone
"
12216,B08PCFV74N,1,"
The seller gave me a faulty phone and and they should’ve done checks on it before selling it!! 0/5 never again!!
"
12217,B08PCFV74N,1,"
I tried 3 different chips from 2 different brands and none of them worked.
"
12218,B08PCFV74N,1,"
I want no association with apple, this was a purchase on my account not for me.
"
12219,B08PCFV74N,2,"
Was expecting something with better battery life. 90% suggests this phone is getting old. Apple recommend changing battery at 80% so it’s half way there.Minor scratch on screen.Not really bowled over, it’s cheaper than a new phone but only time will tell if it turns out to be an actual saving over a contract phone.
"
12220,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Great price. Phone has 100% battery health and only 1 micro scratch on the screen. Looks basically brand new :)
"
12221,B08PCFV74N,1,"
Warning, proceed with caution.  The phone I received had a faulty microphone and clearly had not been checked.  Took a few weeks to receive the refund, so not worth the hassle really compared to buying new.
"
12222,B08PCFV74N,5,"
I’ve had this phone for 5 months now I still haven’t seen an issue with it. It works like a brand new phone. I’m amazed.

There's a little scratch on the screen. Also, finger prints readable somehow require a couple of attempts to recognise.

12228,B08PCFV74N,5,"
this phone is in new condition. Unmarked with 100% battery life.A day late in arriving but that was a courier problem, not the companies fault.highly recommended and will deal with again going forward.

I owned a iPhone 11 and think it's time to upgrade to iPhone 12, but when I first received it was not impressed, after fully charges, a bit overheats and the camera is poor quality, my iPhone 11 better than these, so the next day I requested to return for full refund! I’m really disappointed in this product. getting a refund.
"
12231,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Was great quality,a good price and it arrived very quickly!
"
12232,B08PCFV74N,5,"
This product was in perfect quality no scratches at all even when i looked very close and 100% battery life. I would recommend this product to anyone as it was good value and good quality.
"
12233,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Very good quality phone!
"
12234,B08PCFV74N,5,"
I can't say enough about this phone, as, in the header, it is like a brand-new iPhone. The battery charges to a full 100%, which I find is a problem many people find buying from anywhere else, some only charge to 80%, but not mine. I haven't found anything yet that doesn't work as it should, I cannot praise this seller enough, it's a brilliant piece of kit.
"
12235,B08PCFV74N,4,"
iPhone 12 reconditionné en parfait état. Le profit n’avais aucune rayure, on aurait dit un neuf. Mais après 3 mois d’utilisation je me suis rendu compte que je captais mal la 4 g et qu’elle était de mauvaise qualité. Aussi l’état de santé de ma batterie est passé de 100 a 90 % en 3 mois. La qualité chimique de la batterie m’as donc tout l’air d’être faible. Apart cela, très bon produit avec une super qualité.
"
12236,B08PCFV74N,4,"
Lievi inestetismi sulla scocca posteriore a livello delle fotocamere e dei lati, qualche graffio impercettibile sul vetro frontale, ma nulla che non mi aspettassi. La batteria all’85% mi ha un po’ deluso peró bisogna ammettere che era stato specificato in descrizione che le batterie erano dall’85% in poi (pensa che sfiga proprio a me doveva capitare il requisito minimo). Ho pagato a rate Cofidis. Per il resto é tutto normale, nessun danno di sistema. Poteva essere incartato meglio e la puntina per accedere al vano sim non c’era.
"
12237,B08PCFV74N,4,"
Sono rimasto soddisfatto dell’acquisto. Presenta segni di caduta e sfregamento solo intorno alle fotocamere, sennò sarebbe stato come nuovo esteticamente. Non sono uno che ne fa un grande uso di social o programmi che stressano la CPU, quindi la batteria al 90% non è un ostacolo per me, ma comunque sarà sufficiente per la maggior parte degli acquirenti.
"
12238,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Handy wie neu, nur gaaanz winzige Gebrauchsspuren - mit bloßen Auge nicht zu erkennen, Batterie 99%, Panzerglas, Ladegerät, Schnelle Lieferung, 100% zu empfehlen - WOW

12239,B08PCFV74N,4,"
L’iPhone est bien mais un soucis d’écran tactile et la batterie maximal 86% pourtant j’ai pris «très bonne état » mais caaVa
"
12240,B08PCFV74N,4,"
Compre el teléfono en estado excelente. De aspecto está casi como nuevo, tan sólo tiene unas pequeñas marcas en el marco.Las pegas que veo son la salud de la batería que está al 85% y siendo de estado excelente me esperaba que estuviera algo mejor y por último, viene sin caja original y con un cargador y cable del chino…
"
12241,B08PCFV74N,4,"
Ich hatte erst angst das ich schrott gekauft hab aber ich war echt überrascht das handy hat kein einzigen krazer und sieht toll aus leider ust dur akkukap. Bei 86%  und ust unverpackt nut in Folie angekommen alles in einem bin ich aber zufrieden
"
12242,B08PCFV74N,4,"
Arrivato in tempi previsti.La batteria è al 99% vediamo nel tempo come si comporta , unica pecca un graffio sullo schermo che non rispecchia la descrizione di prodotto eccellente ( che prevede che non si vedono segni evidenti a meno di 30 cm di distanza ). Il resto sembra funzionare tutto a dovere . Non do 5 stelle per il graffio . In ogni caso consiglio l’acquisto
"

Bonjour j’ai reçu le portable 2 jours après la commande ça rien à dire, le téléphone a seulement des chtons en haut et en bas sur le cadre aluminium, état de la batterie à 96%, au bout de 3 jours elle est descendu à 95%, tout fonctionne pour l’instant parfaitement bien, livré avec chargeur complet mais qui n’est pas de chez Apple, une coque transparente de qualité médiocre et un verre trempé pareil de qualité médiocre, mais ça protège pour l’instant c’est le principal. Voilà
"
12244,B08PCFV74N,4,"
ich war sehr skeptisch, sehr ! Aber , ... ich wurde positiv überrascht ! Display top / Sauberkeit top, Funktion fehlerfrei / Batterie 85%, ich bin zufrieden bis ...  der Preis ist etwas zu hoch !

complessivamente al momento sembra soddisfacente

Il telefono é arrivato prima dei tempi stabiliti (e di questo vi ringrazio) ho contattato il venditore per un problema di indirizzo ed é stato pronto nel darmi una corretta soluzione. iPhone è perfetto in tutte le sue funzioni e nell’estetica. Che dire soddisfattissima
"
12247,B08PCFV74N,5,"
All'inizio ero molto titubante vista la spesa da sostenere: comprare un rigenerato su internet oppure no?Vista la dipartita del mio precedente telefono mi sono deciso ed ho proceduto con l'acquisto.Sono molto soddisfatto.Il packaging dell'oggetto è veramente misero ma, a mio avviso, ininfluente ai fini della valutazione: ho comprato un telefono non la scatola che lo contiene.Per cui, vista la mia esperienza, vi consiglio il venditore.
"
12248,B08PCFV74N,4,"
Das Telefon hat als generalüberholtes Gerät ein sehr gutes Äußeres:- der Bildschirm ist makellos- Das Gehäuse hat einen winzigen Kratzer in einer Ecke, sonst fehlerfrei- technisch funktioniert alles wie bei einem NeugerätEinziges Manko:- die Batteriekapazität beträgt nur noch 80 %.Ein baugleiches anderes Gerät, was zwei Jahre im Dauerbetrieb ist, hat 88 %. Daraus schließe ich dass dieses Gerät mindestens drei Jahre alt sein dürfte.Wegen dieser 80 % max. Kapazität Bewerte ich das Gerät in Summe als „gut“ und mit vier Sternen.(Da 80 % für mich die akzeptable Grenze ist, habe ich das Gerät nicht umgetauscht.)
"
12249,B08PCFV74N,4,"
Telefono arrivato puntuale,ben imballato, dentro la confezione oltre alla presa e filo per caricare (la batteria dura tanto) anche una cover trasparente e la protezione vetro, i 2 graffietti sotto sono talmente piccoli che neanche si vedono.....buon acquisto lo consiglio

Il telefono si presenta in maniera quasi perfetta per quello sono contentissimo ma la durata della batteria è veramente scarsa per l’autonomia quindi sono piuttosto deluso per il prezzo che l’ho pagato. Mi aspettavo una batteria più fresca. Credo sarò costretto a farla sostituire… spero non a mie spese

Ho preso per la prima volta un iphone per provare un sistema diverso rispetto ad un android e l'ho trovo molto intuitivo, semplice e veloce. E' arrivato con un giorno di anticipo rispetto al previsto e apparte qualche ammaccatura leggera nei bordi della scocca del telefono ( cosa prevedibile in quanto comprato ricondizionato con dicitura buono e non eccellente) perfettamente funzionante, veloce e e in buone condizioni. Qualità prezzo ottimo, il più conveniente rispetto a tutti gli altri. Assolutamente soddisfatto dell'acquisto fatto!

Spedizione molto veloce (nonostante non fosse Amazon), arrivato un giorno prima del previsto.Condizioni: eccellenti e ho notato un leggero e quasi impercettibile graffietto (davvero minuscolo) sulla parte bassa dello schermo e lo stato della batteria era dell’84% (e speravo di avere una percentuale più bassa, ma purtroppo no, su amazon le condizioni “Eccellenti” assicurano dall’80% dello stato della batteria in poi).Per il resto veramente tutto perfetto, é il mio primo iPhone e penso non sarà assolutamente l’ultimo e sono onestamente felice di aver abbandonato Android.Perché passare da Android ad iOS?- stabilità nel sistema- aggiornamenti precisi e che sicuramente copriranno il dispositivo per parecchi anni (di media 4).- applicazioni ed integrazioni perfettamente ottimizzate con il dispositivo- se ormai (come me) vi siete annoiati nello smanettare con un telefono e della personalizzazione totale ve ne frega poco allora questo potrebbe essere anche un altro motivo per passare ad iOS, ma attenzione, iOS permette tranquillamente una bella parte di personalizzazione ma sempre fino ad un certo punto.

Durée de vie de batterie à 85% autant dire que dans un an il faudra changer… déception mais rentre dans leur condition de vente 80% minimum. Mais déçu quand même !Par contre descriptif erronée, câble usb normal, alors que c’est indiqué usb-C à charge rapide.Vendeur pas très conciliant, au moindre soucis ou insatisfaction il faut renvoyer le produit… pas de solution. Alors que c’est une erreur de description de produit !

Spedizione tutto sommato nei tempi, considerando che il corriere era fedex. iPhone come nuovo salvo qualche lievissimo graffio, batteria al 100%, cavo Apple e caricatore originale inclusi.
"
12258,B08PCFV74N,4,"
Ottimo prodotto. Il cellulare non ha neanche un graffio. L’ unica cosa che mi ha dispiaciuto un pó: un cellulare con lo stato “eccellente” dovrebbe avere uno stato di batterio superiore a 90%. (mi è arrivato con 85%) Peró, di sicuro mi prenderó un altro cellulare ricondizionato.

Questo smartphone non ha bisogno di presentazioni, quindi non dirò nulla su aspetti tecnici o cose simili. Quello che è importante sottolineare, a mio avviso, è la qualità di un prodotto ricondizionato come questo che comunque richiede un esborso economico non indifferente per le tasche della maggior parte delle persone. Quindi il dubbio è sempre lo stesso: prendere un prodotto ricondizionato risparmiando qualche centinaia di euro o fare un ulteriore sforzo e prenderlo nuovo.Ho preso questo telefono per mia figlia quasi adolescente, era da tempo che voleva un iPhone, visto che quasi tutte le sue amiche ce l'hanno. Alla fine ho ceduto ma col patto di spendere al massimo una cifra intorno a 500 euro. Così è stato,  ho preso questo iPhone 12 ricondizionato a 555 euro. Il giudizio sul prodotto è assolutamente positivo. Il telefono è praticamente nuovo, non ha un minimo grasso, nessun difetto di assemblaggio, la batteria dura tranquillamente una giornata. Assolutamente nulla da dire.Il telefono arriva in una scatola non originale con cavo e caricabatteria non originale.Dopo un mesetto ho dovuto cambiare il cavetto in dotazione con un altro da 3A/20w.Consiglio l'acquisto di questo prodotto.

Acquistato ricondizionato ma l’articolo si presenta in perfette condizioni. No graffi, no ammaccature, schermo nuovo e no imperfezioni. Esattamente come nuovo.Ovviamente essendo però ricondizionato non arriva con scatola nuova ufficiale Apple, ma con una anonima del venditore. Non credo sia un problema!

Ero molto neutro a comprare un telefono ricondizionato ma il prezzo mi ha convinto, l’ho comprato e devo dire che sono contento, batteria arrivata al 89% (buono secondo me, poteva essere di meno) e il telefono in uno stato praticamente perfetto, solo una piccola graffa nello speaker però neanche si vede se non lo sai. Il telefono è anche arrivato qualche giorno prima della data di consegna prevista, cosa molto positiva.L’unica cosa che direi come parte non molto positiva è il fatto che lo schermo non sembra di essere quello originale, e per questo non metto 4 stelle. Spunta un messaggio in impostazioni che dice ciò, però, come ho detto prima, per il prezzo sono soddisfatto perché comunque funziona perfettamente. Sinceramente lo comprerei di nuovo.

Para el uso que le doy (redes sociales, cámara, juegos) no tengo ninguna queja. Ni siquiera la batería está tan mal como pensaba (me vino al 85% de salud). Lo único es que tenía algunas mejores expectativas en la calidad de la cámara, por ejemplo a contraluz o a oscuras no me ha llegado a convencer, pero fuera de eso, si se tiene una buena iluminación realmente no tengo quejas, ninguna.

Prodotto arrivato una prima volta con un problema alla batteria, servizio clienti ottimo perchè me lo hanno ritirato e riparato in tempi brevissimi. Purtroppo però ho comprato un telefono in condizioni eccellenti (come da descrizione non dovrebbero esserci graffi visibili oltre i 30 cm) ma lo schermo presenta molti graffi nei bordi abbastanza visibili. Una stella in più perchè la batteria è al 100%.

 Ho acquistato questo Iphone 12 blu (128Gb) ricondizionato in condizioni ""eccellenti"" al prezzo di 660€. Le condizioni sono molto buone, ma è comunque presente un leggero segno sul pannello posteriore (come da foto) e lo schermo è perfetto (forse addirittura nuovo). La batteria risulta essere al 89% della capacità massima.Il prodotto ovviamente è ottimo, ma per condizione ""eccellenti"" mi sarei aspettato una batteria con capacità > 90% e nessun segno sul pannello posteriore (soprattutto considerando il costo pagato).Per questo motivo non do 5 stelle... Segnalo inoltre che nella confezione era addirittura presente un vetro protettivo e una cover trasparente (sorpresa molto gradita).Se ritieni utile questa recensione, sarebbe carino un pollice all'insù.Grazie

Comprato come usato in condizioni ""Eccellenti"" ma sono evidenti graffi sugli angoli superiori ben visibili, non ben pulito e batteria con poco più 80% di massima carica. Schermo integro con proteggi schermo già applicato. Per un telefono pagato circa il 25% meno di uno nuovo sorge il dubbio se ne è valsa la pena. La spedizione gestita come da aspettativa, ma confezione semplice con imballo protettivo un pò semplice. Ho acquistato da poco Phone usato da società tedesca che lo ha spedito in una confezione e packaging simile all'originale e in condizioni da quasi nuovo con lo stesso sconto. Ci sono ampi margini di miglioramento nella gestione dell'usato imparando da altri.

Calidad precio es aceptable. Lo único malo es que lo compre en condición excelente y muestra arañazos a mas de 30cm de distancia, no al revés como decía la publicación ya que no tenia que verse ningún arañazo a mas de 30cm. Cumplieron lo de la batería, que su vida útil (capacidad) es mayor al 80%. La pantalla si me puso un poco a dudar ya que pienso que no esta bien ensamblada porque se puede apreciar que se sale del marco muy ligeramente y si le aplico un poco de presión se observa que se hunde un poco.De resto me funciona todo bien, cumplieron casi como estaba descrito en la publicación.Lo recomiendo si no quieren gastar mucho mas y si no les importa ciertas características quitando los rasguños puede valer la pena para algunos.Mirarlo bien!

Ya me hacia falta cambiarme de teléfono, y pensé en uno que sea calidad/precio como este IPhone. Reacondicionados es una lotería, pero a mi al menos este IPhone me ha salido en muy buen estado. A parte de que llevo buscando este IPhone hace tiempo porque me gusta bastante. En general muy alegre por la compra, ya que el teléfono únicamente me ha venido con un pico en un lateral que apenas se ve el pico ya que es pequeño. Y el porcentaje de la batería está a un 98% a si que bien, si baja rápido estos días lo comentaré.

Inizio dicendo che il prodotto mi è arrivato in ottime condizioni, non nella sua scatola originale ma in una targata ""loop"" con il cavetto originale e addirittura con un caricatore non originale ma nuovo, il prodotto ripeto si presenta molto bene, nessun graffio evidente e nessun tipo di danneggiamento vario, anche lo schermo risulta immacolato e ben tenuto, la batteria nel mio caso era al 99% ma devo segnalare che dopo nemmeno 3 mesi la percentuale è scesa al 95%, personalmente cerco di preservare il più possibile la batteria, ovvero non farlo scaricare oltre il 20% e non farlo caricare oltre 80% (sarà arrivato 5 volte al massimo al 100% e 5 volte sotto il 20% ma mai sotto il 15%, il dispositivo è sempre stato caricato con il caricatore originale della Apple da 20W, quindi valutate voi se è normale questo aspetto. Altra nota dolente è la fotocamera che da qualche giorno ha iniziato ad avere degli artefatti all'interno delle fotografie o video scattati in presenza di poca luce o con un fonte luminosa piazzata frontalmente, oltre a questi problemi devo dire che il telefono funziona davvero bene, nel caso il problema della batteria e della fotocamera dovessero divenire ancora più marcati valuterò se fare il reso. In fin dei conti direi un buon 7.5, magari sono stato sfortunato io.[AGGIORNAMENTO]Segnalo che da giugno la capacità della batteria è scesa fino al 90%, questo a mio parere denota che la batteria molto probabilmente è stata sostituita con una non performante o non originale.[AGGIORNAMENTO 2]Segnalo che la luminosità dello schermo in alcune situazioni diventa davvero bassa, nonostante la luminosità automatica sia disattivata e inoltre non si può alzare e questo comporta che sotto il sole non si veda assolutamente nulla, credo che questo problema sia dato da una sorta di surriscaldamento del dispositivo.Se hai trovato utile la mia recensione sarebbe bello se lasciassi un bel 👍

*Edito porque ha habido cambios en la bateria.La batería llegó con una salud del 97% y a los 11 días está al 95%. Lo cargo únicamente por la noche ya que me llega a final del día sin problema, pero me sorprende que esté bajando la salud tan rápido.Una de las lentes ha venido con varios arañazos, me lo han pulido y ya apenas se ven.Como curiosidad añadir que el iPhone es importado y no decía nada en la descripción, pero todavía no sé si eso podría afectar en algo actualmente o en un futuro en Europa, así que no sé si puede ser algo beneficioso o perjudicial.

C'est la première fois que cela m'arrive et j'en suis très déçu. Il y a eu un réel problème de communication entre Chronopost, la Poste et l'expéditeur sur le colis. Les informations n'étaient pas les mêmes pour chacun. Ce qui a fait que je me suis retrouvé avec un remboursement alors que j'avais bien reçu mon téléphone. Ce téléphone qui d'ailleurs était en parfait Etat comme je l'avais commandé. Aucunes rayures, qualité au top, et batterie à 100 !!! Mon téléphone faisait la journée complète et remplaçait l'ancien qui beug énormément. Mais que je dois reprendre aujourd'hui car je me retrouve contraint de rendre le téléphone acheté. Et pour ces gros problèmes de communication je suis déçu. J'ai acheté ce téléphone durant le black friday et je dois le racheter aujourd'hui, avec un prix plus conséquent... Ce qui est impossible pour un étudiant comme moi.

Il telefono è arrivato sano, con tutte le parti funzionanti però si vede che non è pari al nuovo, nonostante io abbia scelto la categoria A, è arrivato graffiato ai lati della fotocamera e leggermente graffiato sulla parte finale del cellulare anche se non si nota molto.La batteria era dell'88% dunque tra un anno dovrei già cambiarla.Consiglio se non si vuole spendere molto ma tuttavia non vi aspettate chissà che.

Se non sapessi che è stato ricondizionato, potrei credere che sia nuovo. Lo smartphone in pratica non ha un segno che possa farmi pensare che sia stato usato, anche la batteria dalla durata sembra nuovo. Consigliatissimo!!!

Due scalfiture (di cui una abbastanza evidente; vedi foto) sulla scocca ed una percentuale di batteria già all’ 88% (per un telefono uscito 2 anni fa) non mi permettono di essere soddisfatto.

La batería con una salud del 89% y solo unos pequeños arañazos en la parte trasera, todo dentro de lo esperable al ser un producto reacondicionado. Llegó con cargador y una funda trasparente así como protector de pantalla.

J'achète un iPhone 12 blanc 128Go reconditionné avec la mention ""Excellent état"". On paie plus cher pour ça, et d'après les critères du vendeur : ""Corps : aucun signe de dommage cosmétique lorsqu'il est tenu à 30 centimètres de distance"". Sauf qu'on voir des tas d'impacts sur les anneaux de protection des obkectifs photo, même à 1m de distance !Également, des traces collantes (probablement laissées par une ancienne protection de mauvaise qualité) sont mal enlevées.Enfin, la batterie était usagée (capacité 79%, « à réparer » affiché sur le téléphone ) au lieu des plus de 80% garantis.Pour les traces, ça va encore, mais les anneaux abîmés, c'est clairement pas dans les critères ""Excellent état"" du vendeur 😡Je vais renvoyer cet article, et je changerai mon évaluation en fonction de ce qui se passe ensuite…

J’ai acheté cet IPhone 12 bleu 128 go, l’écran a visiblement été  changé car le joint du carter n’est pas bien positionné. Le principal problème est que le haut parleur du haut a commencé par grésiller et maintenant il ne fonctionne plus!!! Impossible d’entendre quoi que ce soit, impossible d’entendre un correspondant ni aucun son…Très déçu !!!Amazon ne me propose ni échange ni réparation seulement remboursement sachant que pour en acheter un nouveau cela me coûterait plus cher ! Incompréhensible sachant que le produit est garantie un an…

Ne ho comprati due uno bianco è uno nero (il bianco ha dei graffi) arrivati senza scatola chiusi in una busta delle lettere, cavetto troppo grosso per caricarli devo levare la cover!  comprati a marzo a distanza di 4 mesi la batteria è scesa a 96% e il nero devo ricaricarlo più volte al giorno si scarica velocemente! Batteria non affidabile per niente ho chiesto il reso meglio comprare un prodotto nuovo.

Acquistato Iphone 12 128 gb il 22 Novembre, prezzo molto competitivo per un dispositivo in condizioni ""eccellenti"" che poi si è rivelato tutto il contrario. Il dispositivo infatti presentava ammaccature molto visibili sulla scocca da oltre 30 cm di distanza (al contrario di quanto scritto sul sito) e lo schermo presentava dei graffi ben visibili anche senza tenere il dispositivo controluce. Inoltre presa lightning e altoparlante frontale sporchi con presenza di polvere, non il massimo per un dispositivo che dovrebbe essere testato e ripulito.Nemmeno configurato, effettuerò il reso. Spero sia stato solo un caso perchè il prezzo era ottimo e la spedizione sempre al top su amazon.

Compre el producto aproximadamente el 5 de agosto en estado excelente, a dia de hoy, 28 de noviembre ha bajado un 7% la salud de la bateria (Ya vieniendo con algunas marcas de uso y un 94% de salud), algo bastante raro que baje tan rapido no dandole mucho uso dia a dia (llego al final del dia con aprox un 45% y lo pongo a cargar con el cargador proporcionado, supuestamente compatible, y no dejandolo por la noche), hoy me encontrado con la sorpresa de que casi se podria haber quemado el escritorio porque el cable proporcionado (supuestamente, certificado por MFi) a empezado a echar humo.Aparte de todo esto, el movil es la versión de EEUU (a2172), que no deberia ser un problema en cuanto a las bandas, aunque el 5G no ha funcionado correctamente (teniendo antena cerca de casa y comprobado con la misma SIM en un movil 5G [Mi10T] ).En cuanto al resto, vino bien empaquetado, sin la caja original (no es problema).Se pide la devolución, ya que no termino de fiarme de que el terminal este en buen estado o no el indicado despues de haber pasado un tiempo de prueba bastante extenso.

Pessima esperienza: ho acquistato due iPhone 12 in condizioni ""eccellenti"" che mi sono pervenuti con schermi non originali e di cattiva qualità, nonostante la descrizione dell'oggetto parli solo della possibilità di accessori (e non componenti) non originali - problema non da poco dato il prezzo pagato. Una volta contattato, il venditore non sembra aver dato alcuna importanza al problema.
"
12380,B08PCFV74N,3,"
Inizio col dire che è un ricondizionato a metà e questo perché è indecente avere un telefono che è stato testato e rimesso a nuovo ma con un auricolare gracchiante. Impossible fare telefonate se non con l'auricolare e poi gli audio di WhatsApp a volte manco si sentono bisogna riavviare l'App. Oltretutto il telefono scalda in una maniera allucinante soprattutto quando si ricarica in wireless. Meno male che c'è la garanzia Amazon renewed perché farò sicuramente il reso

Il telefono mi è arrivato con un graffio sulla fotocamera posteriore ,mentre quella anteriore anche se la pulisco mi trasmette l’immagine sempre e comunque sfocata sul display ,apparte questi due problemi che mi infastidiscono il telefono è praticamente quasi  nuovo peccato che in oltre dopo un po’ di giorni che lo sto usando ho notato che una cassa audio non va e l’hot spot non si può attivare per via di Danni tecnici
"
12388,B08PCFV74N,1,"
Telefono arrivato in anticipo, tutto perfetto fino all'accensione. Ho notato subito che la cornice nera era stranamente spessa (più del mio iPhone 12 originale) e che il lato inferiore era addirittura più spesso degli altri, decentrando così l'immagine. Allora con il dubbio che si trattasse di un ricambio ho guardato più attentamente e ho visto che la nitidezza delle scritte era decisamente peggiore. Finita la configurazione ho avuto la conferma nelle impostazioni dove è riportato che lo schermo è una parte sconosciuta, probabilmente non originale.Capisco la necessità di ricondizionare telefoni con schermi danneggiati, ma mi metti un display cinese sgranato e lo spacci anche per A+?State attenti ai dettagli.

Nel giro di pochi mesi il telefono ha iniziato ad avere degli spegnimenti improvvisi e alla riaccensione il livello della batteria era cambiato dal 90 al 20% , mai una caduta , sempre trattato con perizia , gli ultimi giorni ha smesso di ricevere la carica e restava acceso al 1% solo se collegato , ma senza andare oltre quella percentuale  . Sulle impostazioni messaggio di errore che avvisa che la batteria non è originale e forse proprio per questo è durata così poco , assurdo per un telefono pagato 640 euro e tra l’altroregalato . Chiesto reso e oltre il danno la beffa perché dovrò restare una settimana o forse più senza telefono perché avrò rimborso solo dopo che il venditore riceverà l’oggetto.
"
12397,B08PCFV74N,1,"
eigentlich sollte ich ein Foto mit einstellen. Das Gerät habe ich jedoch dirket wieder verpackt und retourniert. Dieses Gerät als ""ausgezeichnet"" für 550 Euro zu verkaufen ist eine bodenlose Frechtheit. Das Gerät hat noch nie eine Schutzfolie gesehen, außerdem ist der Vorbesitzter wohl mit einer Ecke an einer Hauswand entlang geschlittert oder es viel aus entsprechender Höhe auf den Asphalt. Total abgeranzt. Sowas hab ich noch nie geschafft mit meinen Smartphones, welche mal gestürzt sind.Dass Amazon für sowas seinen/ihren Namen hinhält ist kaum zu glauben. Ich habe kein Neugerät erwartet aber das Teil gehört eigentlich entsorgt. Unglaublich, unterirdisch, für dumm verkauft oder inkompetente Mitarbeiter. Nie wieder generalüberholt.

Venditore raccomandato! Il telefono (acquistato in condizionino eccellenti) sembra a tutti gli effetti nuovo, ad eccezione della batteria 89%,comunque dura tutta la giornata se lo si usa normalmente.Pare funzioni tutto alla perfezione , in caso aggiornerò la recensione

12399,B08PCFV74N,2,"
il telefono è arrivato 2 settimane prima della data prevista, quindi il venditore è stato davvero efficiente; peccato che abbia dovuto restituirlo perchè l'audio all'orecchio e in vivavoce era basso, non regolabile e disturbato. ok invece quello in cuffia. Il telefono dal punto di vista estetico era in condizione perfette

Telefono arrivato con bordi ammaccati ma lievemente, schermo non compatibile con il dispositivo, surriscaldamento estremo della batteria (non usabile per più di 5min) andava a fuoco, cristalli liquidi scadenti, microfono mal funzionante. Tutto questo risolvibile, ma venditore mi ha accusato mi aver fatto danni, quando io ho inviato subito foto e prove subito all’arrivo del telefono. Scortese e maleducati. Per me non sono dei venditori terzi a cui affidarsi. Avevo chiesto aiuto a loro e mi hanno detto di aspettare 14 gg, così da farmi perdere la garanzia A-Z Amazon. Per fortuna non ho aspettato e sono stato rimborsato. Amazon affidabile. LOMBARDO SHOP VERAMENTE EVITABILE
"
12403,B08PCFV74N,5,"
Prodotto arrivato in anticipo, non nella scatola originale di iPhone ma in una scatola del venditore, senza auricolari ne alimentatore (per non è un problema perché avevo già un iPhone e userò quelli), ma il telefono è in ottime condizioni, non ha un graffio sembra nuovo. Se vogliamo trovare un difetto la batteria è al 90% ma essendo ricondizionato ci sta. Venditore consigliato, perché ho letto  recensioni dello stesso prodotto ma di altri venditori e quasi tutti si lamentavano di segni di usura.

El móvil que recibí estaba impoluto por fuera, únicamente tenía unas marcas en el cristal mínimas. Lo único que tuve que devolverlo debido a que se reiniciaba constantemente y había momentos que se quedaba la pantalla en negro y no encendía. El servicio postventa no me dio ninguna opción a la hora de comentárselo y que me mandaran otro y hacerme otro tipo de compensación, me dijeron mándalo y te reembolsamos el dinero, lo que demuestra dejadez por su parte y poco buen trato hacia el cliente. Por esto le pongo una estrella.

Venditore scorretto!Ho preso un Iphone12 ricondizionato (in ottime condizioni estetiche) ma dopo nemmeno un mese ha smesso di funzionare senza apparenti motivi, senza subire ne cadute ne urti.Amazon mi ha autorizzato il reso per garanzia ma l'assistenza del fornitore rifiuta il rimborso o sostituzione perchè nella cover mi ci è venuto un graffio. E per un graffio mi invalidi la garanzia di questo grave malfunzionamento?  Intanto il cellulare non funziona più.Roba da vergognarsi! Venditore sconsigliato!

ho comprato questo prodotto la prima volta l’ho restituito subito perché tutti i tasti per i volumi e per l’accensione erano incastrati dentro l’iphone e la seconda che l’ho ordinato la batteria in neanche un mese mi è scesa dall’90% è arrivata all’88%

Telefono buono a vista ma schermo non originale oltretutto di pessima qualità batteria 88% e forse oltre allo schermo chi sa cos’altro non originale per il prezzo pagato prodotto descritto condizioni eccellenti mi aspettavo uno schermo migliore è una batteria nuova per il prezzo pagato ,non è compreso nemmeno una cover è un vetrino protettivo deluso dell’acquisto

Telefono pieno di graffi sulle fotocamere, ammaccature sul bordo del telefono e memoria al 90% e considerato che ho acquistato il telefono allo stato eccellente mi è impossibile accettare questi compromessi.Ho fatto il reso e cosa peggiore in tutto questo è che in 5 giorni che l'ho fatto non hanno ancora controllato in che stato si trova(l'ho usato letteralmente 5min) e non mi hanno ancora fatto il reso.Servizio clienti imbarazzante! Per niente soddisfatto

Acheté en ""Excellent état"", pour rappel Amazon annonce comme critères :""Écran : aucune rayure, Corps : aucun signe de dommage cosmétique lorsqu'il est tenu à 30 centimètres de distance.""Le téléphone présente pourtant une rayure bien visible sur l'écran et la peinture autour des deux objectifs photo est écaillée. Les deux défauts sont visible au premier coup d'oeil donc le vendeur est soit incompétent soit malhonnête, aux choix.Pour ce qui est de la batterie je ne peux pas me prononcer. Je ne suis pas allé jusqu'à l'allumer, il est retourné directement dans sa boite.En attente de remboursement.

Abbiamo ordinato un telefono nero ed è arrivato blu ma siccome era urgente (abbiamo pagato anche la spedizione) poichè mia figlia studia fuori città ed era senza telefono, lo abbiamo tenuto, comprando una cover nera;-). Dopo 20 giorni non riconosce più la SIM (che provata nel mio telefono funziona). Abbiamo chiesto la sostituzione, speriamo siano rapidi (mia figlia è a casa una settimana) e che stavolta.. funzioni. È vero che è rigenerato ma costa quasi come nuovo. Peccato, la telecamera è valida e per 3 settimane è stato un buon telefono.

En mi caso, el teléfono vino con la cámara delantera estropeada. Por fuer atenía algún rasguño pero no pude ni iniciarlo xq no me funcionaba el reconocimiento facial. Lo devolveré en lo que pueda, estoy esperando que me conteste el vendedor.

Para ser reacondicionado me ha sorprendido, la calidad muy buena, parecida al 13 de empresa que había tenido hasta ahora.

Complessivamente ottimo a livello display ed estetico e nella dotazione completa la batteria mi aspettavo un po’ meglio del 90%

El teléfono llegó en aparente buen estado. La pantalla estaba cambiada, pero al ser reacondicionado, es algo comprensible. Sin embargo, a la semana de usarlo, falló el Face ID y he tenido que devolverlo. Tal y como he leído en otros comentarios, quizá deberían revisar algo mejor los teléfonos reacondicionados antes de venderlos, pues es una auténtica lotería. El servicio de logística por parte de Amazon para la devolución y resolver dudas, inmejorable. Me acabo de comprar uno nuevo para no llevarme más sustos. XD

Non capisco perché mi è stata cancellata la precedente recensione.Quindi la riscrivo: l'iPhone 12 verde vednuto da RG RENT è tutto graffiato con un graffio importante sulla fotocamera anteriore/face ID. A volte nn riconosce il FaceID e se metto una pellicola il FACE ID non viene proprio riconosciuto e quindi sono costretto ad usare il codice di sblocco o a rimuovere la pellicola!L'ho comprato perché c'era la dicitura: condizioni eccellenti. Non chiedevo un iPhone nuovo di zecca, ma almeno uno con pochi graffi e un pò più nuovo. Ho gia richiesto il reso. Lo comprerò da un altro venditore

Ho scritto al venditore ancora senza risposta, l’iPhone che ho ricevuto ieri pomeriggio ha il frame in alluminio con profonde ammaccature e graffi, il che è molto lontano dalla descrizione “nessun segno di imperfezione a distanza di 30cm”, sono segni visibili anche a 1m (purtroppo). In queste condizioni un iPhone nuovo scontato è un’opzione più dignitosa.

Rapporto qualità prezzo direi basso/molto basso, si paga un iPhone ricondizionato 100€ in meno rispetto al nuovo e ti arriva con la scocca rovinata su tutti gli angoli, lo schermo è ok, ma sinceramente mi aspettavo molto di meglio.Mi ritengo deluso dall’acquisto, e consiglio di non fidarsi troppo della descrizione del prodotto “difetti estetici non visibili da 1 metro” mi sembra un po’ una presa in giro, i difetti si vedono, da ben più di 1 metro

Ich hatte mich sehr auf das Handy gefreut und konnte kaum auf die Lieferung warten.Ich bin zutiefst enttäuscht gewesen als ich die grüne elektrische Linie am Display sah. 😲Ich meine das Handy kostet gerade nicht wenig und man hätte sich bisschen Mühe bei der Überprüfung des Handys und der Verpackung geben können.Bevor das Handy ankam habe ich das passende Panzerglas und die passende Hülle gekauft was mir etwa 40€ gekostet habe, und selbst die haben mich mehr Freude gemacht als das Handy.Nun habe ich das Vertrauen verloren und leider nicht zu empfehlen.🥲

This is my first iPhone bought about two years ago when the 13s were coming out. I didnt regret not getting the latest model then and I feel no particular pressure to upgrade to the current 14 pros. I am happy with my purchase. Compared to the newer models you maybe missing on the higher refresh rate display (120hz on the pro models) and the smaller notch on the 13 pros or the dynamic island on the newer 14s. Apart from that the 'apple' experience is the same. the build quality is just as good and the camera is still excellent even now almost three years later.Coming from a galaxy note: If you are from an android experience the one thing you will be giving up is the freedom to install whatever app you want and customising to your heart's content. If you have also invested in a wider tech ecosystem (speakers, lights, home camera) you should check compatibility with iOS before making the switch. Alexa is a great compromise as it works with either OS.
"
12564,B08L5PVZ9Y,3,"
I'll make it clear from the beginning - it was rather a struggle than a new experience, I couldn't wait to go back to my S21 Ultra.Pros- I liked the colour I got and the overall design - looks very sober and cool, like a proper nearly luxurious piece and that's probably what makes people love it - looks luxuriously;- battery is doing very well specifically on this model 12 Pro Max as the battery is bigger inside the phone, the CPU is well optimized and the display is still 60Hz, it is doing really well and even using the phone all day with Data and Wi-fi on, with a lot of time with the screen on and adaptive brightness, at 8PM I still have 35-40% of battery and there should be fair to mention this;- iOS is working good, as an overall experience. Smooth and easy but there's the same with most flagship smartphones nowadays so that's not a super feature, but worth to be mentioned as a pro;- FaceID is doing a relatively good job as well. But there are issues with it as well sometimes if I'm a bit too close to the phone, like 15-20cm it will not recognize me and I'll have to put the phone a bit further so that it could work. Also because of the mask which I'm still using ever day because of the pandemic, I always have to put it down a bit to unlock my phone with the FaceID, this is really uncomfortable. The great thing tho is that it's working in the total darkness and that's cool. I'll take it as a pro but not totally happy with it.Here I'm mostly done with the pros that I could  really appreciate and find super useful and great.Cons:- the same - design. Even tho it's looking cool, it was incredibly hard and unpleasant to operate it. The edges are really sharp, really uncomfortable, the Pro Max is a big phone and sometimes it's hard to operate it with one hand. I use to hold it in my hand keeping it with my little finger from the bottom and after only 20-30 minutes I could feel pain in my little finger and it wasn't because of the weight of the phone, but the edge which was super sharp and I found it really questionable - nobody could think about this before launching such design? Same while holding tight the phone with one hand - after some time it hurts, really hurts and that's because of the edges.- the notch and the edges - I couldn't really feel that I'm using a 2020 smartphone - it has those bezels that are still a bit bigger than other smartphones - the same S21 Ultra or some Huawei flagship, for example. It may not be a big deal for someone, but that's noticeable when switching from S21 Ultra to 12 Pro Max. About the notch - after a few days stopped noticing it, but every time I watch YouTube or Prime Video, I see it there and it's not cool at all. It doesn't feel as cool and futuristic as other smartphones.- camera - that's not even near to what every iPhone user uses to say - the best camera. Nowhere near to what is used to be called the best camera. There are pictures that are taken very good, about pictures I I'm fine but still can't see what's better than other smartphones, just a very good quality picture, by the way was struggling to download some pics on my Windows laptop and attach them to some email or edit in Photoshop as they were in some other format and had to change settings to get usual JPEG pics instead of their format - may be good for MacOS users but definitely not for most of users. Also, the camera is taking awful videos, couldn't believe that was the least Pro Max iPhone and if with daylight it could do a more or less good job, while inside under the artificial light it is not focusing properly, is not adjusting the settings automatically and it's truly unbelievably how bad it could be, the S21 Ultra is doing a fantastic job no matter of the environment and light, the iPhone couldn't. The wide pics are ok but when it comes about telephoto zoom - rubbish x2.5 compared to X10 or X3 from Samsung S21 Ultra. Just rubbish telephoto.- the iOS 15 - 8 have updated my iPhone almost a few days after buying it so most of the time I used to use it on iOS 15. That wasn't the experience I was waiting from iOS, to be honest. Probably should stay on iOS 14.7 or whichever was the latest one...- display. Even tho it's showing a great picture and colours very good, brightness very good, when coming from 120Hz from S21 Ultra to 60Hz it feels just so bad, so so bad...There are many other points but I don't see a reason to mention as it was either the same experience as with my previous Samsungs or a bit worse but not worth to mention.I'm sorry iPhone, 3 stars because I had expectations, very big but nothing that could prove the status of ""the best smartphone"" as many people use to say.

Moving from the iPhone 10 There isn’t to many changes which is what I love as I personally find Apple have maximised the features I use most for a phone for my everyday needs, The iPhone 4’s shape is a welcoming return taking a moment to look at this phone is such an elegant design, although being the pro max model I do usually find due to its boxer structure it doesn’t feel as comfortable to hold as the curves from the previous models, with the anxiety of losing grip and smashing the phone it’s a constant worry when out and about, triple checking you’re phones actually sliding into you’re jean pocket, the sheer size of the phone is big where two hands would be preferable and for some people necessary as using Safari browsing the internet trying to get my thumb to reach the previous page can be tricky and again makes you feel like you’re about to drop it, Picture and sound is amazing as always but where I’ve found the biggest difference is the camera, without even trying I was taking pictures that looked professionally taken without even trying so I am looking forward to taking this phone out to try use all its camera specs to the full. 5G capabilities depends on your phone’s carrier but I don’t see any improvement in speed, if anything I see lag before it pops down to 4G and then works fine but isn’t really an issue for me or most I would imagine, in settings you can allow the phone to use its full potential on 5G when available but it’s hardly found you can also turn this off and just use 4G only. There wasn’t a charger plug within the box which I already knew, but for those who don’t you’ll need to buy one, it’s a usb-c type not the traditional types most have been using for a few years now it does however have the usb-c to Lightning cable ready, you can also still wirelessly charge the phone. Great phone would recommend.

It's an amazing iPhone - and if it were half the weight it is, you would need force to persuade me to release it. I think weight is a declared attribute and therefore I have not deducted stars...The camera is extraordinary: 8 years ago I had a proper Canon SX50 (which replaced my 400D of 5 years earlier) - bottom of the upper-mid-range cameras. This is better! - and enormously easy to use (""point and shoot"" used to mean awful, ""but"" NOT now).For the record, nobody else paid for the camera (I bought it on my standard Amazon account) and nobody has even talked to me about paying for a review) - it was entirely my decision, without any encouragement, to get this iPhone!Having said that, I have reluctantly returned it... ONLY because its weight is (just) too much for a shirt pocket. I think I will be sorry, but I am going to try the 12 Pro - as a lighter version. If I used a wallet, trouser pocket, or handbag, I would definitely have kept it.

After using it couple month I fully happy with its performance and shape.First I wasn’t much appreciated that Apple brought back iPhone 5 square edge design back. However it brilliant to hold, I have 12 pro max 256gb model and it has nice wide and big display . So holding big mobile could be challenging however it’s square ashes makes it easy to hold.Significantly fast than my iPhone 11 model. Couple points below witch really stands out:- battery power outstanding, I’m heavy user and it last my all day and much left over, my previous model I should charge 2-3 times.- picture quality, fantastic picture quality with improved portrait mode and 3 easy choose lenses .- screen display amazing , wide, big, colourful and responsive. Ideal for gaming and browsing on web, once get to use I didn’t want use smaller displays.Overall it’s expensive but worth every penny, ideal for professional and heavy users.

Best iPhone ever.I have always had an iPhone since 2008, usually the standard version. The previous one to this was the iPhone XS. This is the first bigger one.I am so pleased with the reversion to the previous shape with the aluminium frame.The phone looks amazing and the screen is simply beautiful. The sound production is fab, as are the photographs that it takes. This is where it sweeps the board for me: the pics are amazing. In low light this is just superb.The screen rotation is brilliant on these bigger iPhones, and makes things like the calendar really great to use. More a mini iPad functionality.Everything is very crisp and you just want to dive in.Oh, the 5G is great. Thank you to unlimited data on 5G. Brilliant.I hope that you have found this review helpful.

12570,B08L5PVZ9Y,5,"
My new play thing arrived quickly and overly packaged as  is the norm for Amazon.The phone is a nice upgrade over my XS Max. It’s quite pricey but is par for the course with Apple. In return you get the build quality and polished software that you expect from an iPhone.If you like iPhones you’ll love this model. If you’re an android fan, you’ll hate it.As for negatives… the price increase between the 128g and the 512g is excessive. It would have been nice to have the option of using an sd card to boost the storage as an option.
"
12571,B08L5PVZ9Y,5,"
Ok... this is by far the best phone on the market... fast, reliable... i bought it for the camera and no suprises here. You cannot compare it to iphone 12, even pro is not taking pictures as impressive as this. Even if you are bad with camera, you can impress with this...Battery life is shockingly good although i take quite alot of pictures and watch videos. Before i bought, thought might be too big, but screen size is ideal to watch videos, spend time with your phone. Sound quality is top...Value for money ? Well, it is quite expensive, but it is a high end product. When you pay this money, you are looking for a superb phone and here it is. You get what you pay for...

My experience whit the iPhone it’s nice but the experience want I have once I received the package I never forgetVery funny but scary in the same time  i received the package I open the box and the driver I come back to leave me one more package and I left the phone and the sofa I don’t see when I drop between the pillows and when I come back I see it’s not the phone and the box 🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️Scared 😱 but like me I can enjoy my phone 🙏🙏🙏 take care how you open the boxThanks for Amazon for nice delivery and so quickly

So far I really love this phone. I recently switched from Android to iOS for the first time and I must say that I’m quite a big fan of it now, I would have never thought it was possible. I had to google how to do a lot of things but I guess that is normal! I am impressed with the build quality and the clear sound of the speakers. I also love how big this phone is. I had a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 before and the screen of the iPhone is actually bigger! Really love it!
"
12574,B08L5PVZ9Y,5,"
Ok, yes this is a brilliant phone especially video & photo quality. It’s a great phone, however if I were to add any negs at all I would say the battery isn’t any longer or durable on this make as it is on other iPhones &  I’ve had a few. Price wize I’d say its not worth wot I paid. I’d have to say absolutely not. You’re paying for the name at the end of the day. If someone was to say to me, pay wot you think it’s worth, I’d go with Pheraps  £800.
"
12575,B08L5PVZ9Y,5,"
A massive upgrade on my iPhone 8 Plus. Photo quality is so much better and massive storage capacity means I can download all the videos, podcasts and apps I want. Also, battery life is much better so never have to recharge during the day. I like the face recognition software which means you don’t have to remember a password every time you make an online purchase. Can’t think of anything negative to say about the product. The only thing is I now have a iPad and digital camera which are more or less superfluous.
"
12576,B08L5PVZ9Y,4,"
Amazing battery life easy to use compare to 13 pro max this is best
"
12577,B08L5PVZ9Y,5,"
Very happy up to now runs faster than my iPhone 11 camera much better the only down side is the charger lead won’t fit in a usb & you don’t get the plug it’s extra? But the old iPhone 11 cable does fit & works but it’s a bit loose so  another money maker from apple
"
12578,B08L5PVZ9Y,5,"
I didn't really need an upgrade as my 10s was working fine but I am such a sucker for the iPhone. Camera is amazing and the size is great (there is a lot of negative reviews about this but I like it). If you dont need one dont buy it. It is the same price as a MacBook. However if you need a new one or want to move to Apple (rather than the awful android) then def buy.
"
12579,B08L5PVZ9Y,4,"
This is a very good phone. Sophisticated and the camera is really good. Sadly I had to return mine as it became extremely hot during charge and Face ID stopped working and could not reset. I had phone for 3-4 weeks. I will be replacing as I can’t imagine using any other phone now.I wish apple added an earbud and adapter though.

Got several different iPhones for myself and my business partners at the end of last year to celebrate what we have achieved throughout the year, which is manage to survive. However the pro max arrived in January, maybe people nowadays like huge phones and it’s out of stock for a long time. But gosh it’s really a big boi. Haven’t test any pro-only features yet but my business partner loves it and that’s good enough. Just get yours ASAP when there’s still stock.
"
12582,B08L5PVZ9Y,5,"
I waited and waited to get this phone. I love it. I love the color and size. It came well boxed. Apple products are kinda on the expensive side of things. But it doesn’t bother me as I worked and saved up for this phone.Once I get used to it a bit more. I will update my review. For now I just wanna enjoy myNew phone 📱
"
12583,B08L5PVZ9Y,5,"
The iPhone 12 Max is an upgrade to my iPhone X and the most noticeable thing about the new device is not the size but the weight.  The new Max display is superb and the operating system is much smoother and more fluid than my old device.  I have no issues with the size of the new device and find it easy to handle even in the genuine Apple silicone case.Sold and supplied by Amazon with free guaranteed next day special delivery.
"
12584,B08L5PVZ9Y,5,"
Do what it should do, good battery, bit over priced as usuall the apple stuff, but at least I had a chanche to pay it 5 slices (for 5 months).There is no charger in the box just a single cable, so it’s better to buy it with usb c connection which is charging up approx 30 mins for 80-90%
"
12585,B08L5PVZ9Y,5,"
THE best apple phone by a long way. If your not glued to your screen as most of the population are today expect 3 full days before recharge needed.It will also run YouTube for a solid 21 hours with 12% battery life left.Apple prices are its only drawback and surely would double sales if under the £1,000 pound limit.First class piece of Tech +++
"
12586,B08L5PVZ9Y,5,"
Being non tech I worried a bit about setting this up. I needn’t have it was super easy to transfer everything from my old iPhone. As I’ve got older I also found my old phone difficult to read and to type on. This max is far better with a superior display as well as being larger.

Fantastic phone. Come from being on Android for ten years and had an S10+ previously. Never looked back, amazon monthly payments made it possible for me to grab one of these. Expensive but sheer quality, ignore any negative comments. I only have to charge this thing once every two days for god sake!

Box came empty so far no face recognition, no battery life and Can you call empty box priced 817.88£ good value for money?It looks like somebody who is working in Amazon Warehouse just appropriate mine IPhone 12 Pro Max to prove it I have an evidence which is empty package with label on it that stands the total weight of package that has been sent to me is 200 grams but the weight of the IPhone 12 Pro Max itself is 230 grams so anybody can easily do the math, the total weight of package has got to be way more, as my review keeps been removed by Amazon I’d go farther as such service is unacceptableFor 817.88£ I received from Amazon empty box of IPhone 12 Pro Max plus a lot of stress, no way to get the phone on which my weekend was depend on.AMAZON ! package that weights 230 grams no way can have the Iphone12 pro Max with mass of 228 grams inside!I hope it’s not a high Math for you .THE SO CALLED SERVICE OF AMAZON. APPEARS A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT AND DISSATISFACTION TO ME THIS WEEKEND...It looks like Amazon do not care about their costumers as they conduct so called service with item of high value (price) in such manner.Who is gonna give me back my weekend, my time?AMAZON YOU RUINED MY WEEKEND!

I like using iPhone. Bought it to upgrade my 64GB iPhone 8 Plus. But it made me disappointed. It’s 5G and the storage is 4 times than my old one. However it lags quite often and the speed isn’t fast enough. Not sure what is wrong with it. The battery life is extremely excellent. That’s the only thing that I thought I didn’t waste money.🤣

The box is very small and the screen is a little bigger than the iPhone xs Max.Amazon can quickly order and get the real thing, my friend in the official network to order a month to get, it is really very convenient.It's really like an enlarged version of the iPhone 4s, which is very classic.

Having used an older 6plus for the last few years, the look is different and feels a lot heavier to carry with almost same size screen, still searching for the vow factor on this model. It doesn’t justify the price tag for what I received.

It's ok, no better or worse than my previous iphone XR. The wifi has issues where I need to turn on & off to get it going. 5g is very fast around 190mbps indoors, but I have no need for that speed. It is well built and has a weight to it compared to a 12. It is very expensive for a phone which essentially just enables me to waste money buying things, take pics & make calls. Having lived with this phone for almost a year I can say I hate it! I had it replaced due to the back smashing & the new one has all the same issues. It is slow, functions worse than the xr and I can safely say this will be my last phone as I refuse to go to android.

After spending £1200 on a new phone, I was totally disappointed and felt conned when I opened the box to find no earphones, no C type adapter or plug to enable charging. I had to go out and purchase a C/USB cable £12. Not impressed. Unhappy. For a (3x C 1cm square adapters @£6 for 3) or a (£12 C port plug). £1200 to sacrifice an adaptor would complete the contents.

At fist this came I thought it was fave still haven’t suspicious as App Store is android store so this needs fixing or is like a new phone this is the worst phone I’ve ever brought in my life in not happy ans I’d this doesn’t get sorted I’ll be seen it to the bigger office
"
12709,B08L5PVZ9Y,1,"
Phone arrived sealed but I noticed my battery was dying quick and I’ve only had the phone for 3 weeks and after checking the battery health I noticed it was only 84%
"
12710,B08L5PVZ9Y,2,"
I was expecting more for this price honestly.
"
12711,B08L5PVZ9Y,1,"
very difficult to rate a phone when there is no sound the speaker did not work
"
12712,B08L5PVZ9Y,1,"
I hardly used the mobile for 2 to 3 hours after the delivery.  I switched off the mobile and tried it power it on.  But it appears to be completely dead and not turning on at all
"
12713,B08L5PVZ9Y,2,"
Phone performance is ok
"
12714,B08L5PVZ9Y,1,"
I fount a strange thing. That is when I try to turn the phone the logo was blinking one time and vanished . After 3-4 second  it will appear. I asked my friends as well. But no one have the solution.
"
12715,B08L5PVZ9Y,1,"
ordered this phone as a gift and when opened , seal was broken and phone missing from it's own boxseriously?
"
12716,B08L5PVZ9Y,1,"
There is nothing to much extraordinary in the phone moreover not even the essentials like proper charger or headphones so no justification for this much price
"
12717,B08L5PVZ9Y,1,"
Loses wifi continuously poor transmission fades in and out would not recommend this phone as quality of service poor and very expensive too many bad reviews on Apple community

Always had iPhones since 2010 usually update every year, The iPhone12 promax is easily the best one so far, The screen is absolutely amazing a lot of people are viewing the phone I’m not really talking about also how good the sounders it’s so loud specially go on YouTube searching for things like Dolby vision test, You get this kind of like weird 3-D sound it’s great the cameras are brilliant the max a technology is great I bought an official Apple product Red silicone MagSafe case for the phone as soon as you click it on you get a nice little pop up it even detects what colour case you have! I bought the 20w apple Charger adapter plug seeing as from now on Apple will not be Bundling a pair of headphones or plug And they’re now stating it’s because they’re trying to cut carbon footprint what strange is though I had to buy a plug adapter separate which is even more packaging and then if I wanted new headphones that will be even MORE packaging so basically they’re just lying about it and wanting even more of your money! The phone charge is ridiculous fast with the 20w and with the £19 to be fair, overall the cameras are the best on any iPhone the sound quality is superb, oled screen is superb with 6.7 inch screen, games perform fast and fluid, 5g future proof, a great battery, And if like me you were getting kind of sick and tired of the old Apple phone of the last few years and much like myself prefer the old iPhone 4 design then this will make you smile when you first lift it out of the box!! It’s feels amazing in your hands!! Best Apple phone ever, best smart phone ever...

 I have always owned an iPhone since 2008 and I have to say that this phone was a serious disappointment! I preordered the iPhone 12 Max Pro as soon as it was made available for preorder.-First, Apple no longer offers the the USB connector or earphones that usually come with the phone when you newly purchase it. With that said, if your current charger or earphones aren’t working properly you better budget to buy new ones separately. Apple claims this decision was made to “save the environment by reducing the size of the box” however, the price of the phone was not reduced to make up for that.Moreover, how are they saving the environment when they are clearly selling the USB connector and earphones separately in different boxes!!!-Secondly, there is a glitch with the camera (front and back). Whenever there is a bright light shining in the background, a green dot that appears to be the reflection of the light can be seen on the screen! The green dot can even be seen during FaceTime calls!-Third, whenever you record videos in HD or 4K mode, the phone battery overheats quickly making it difficult to hold the phone bear hands.-Lastly, vertical lines appear through the screen whenever you take videos regardless of which mode you are in HD or 4K.I would highly recommend holding off on buying this phone until Apple fixes those glitches. This phone and the quality is not meet my expectations.

The best iPhone yet, I’ve been running this phone for about 2 months now and it’s great, w a 30w charger it charges to 50% in ab 30 minutes, I put on charge overnight and it lasts the whole day so battery life is great, the camera r great but the selfie camera isn’t the best in low light, but the main cameras are great, the phone is quite slippery in hand wout a case it j feels like it wld slip out of ur hands so a case is definetly needed, the screen is very clear fast and responsive Face ID works perfectly, if u have smaller hands it might be a good choice to get the 12 pro instead of the pro max but j have huge hands and it’s perfect, 10/10 from me

I have been an iPhone user since the beginning. Don't get me wrong, I have tried Android phones in the past but I always go back to the iPhone. I purchased the 11 Pro Max in February 2020 but when I saw that Apple had finally released a large screen iPhone it was a no-brainer to upgrade to get the 12 Pro Max which I now have in my hands and it is AMAZING! Yes, the camera isn't as high spec as some other phones but the technology behind the cameras on the iPhone gives you the same if not better quality images. At the end of the day, top brand Android phones now cost the same as iPhones so no one can moan about the cost anymore. The situation with no charger in the box doesn't bother me either. I have several chargers in the house that work perfectly plus a wireless charger in my study so not having a charger should not bother anyone and if it helps the environment by not adding one to the box then thats a positive thing for me. The overall build quality of the iPhone is beyond perfection. At the end of the day, you pay for what you get and with Apple, you get quality!

How do you milk sheep?Bring out a new I phone and charge £1000 for it.
"
12730,B08L5PVZ9Y,5,"
One word that sums this phone up....... Exceptional!! 1. The screen quality is incredibly good.2. The camera setup is like nothing before, I’ve used Samsung’s in the past but this camera is the best out there.3. Battery life is very good, being a heavy user I can get two days of use.4. The feel of this phone in your hand is pure quality, bigger is definitely the way to go.It’s not the cheapest phone around but when you consider how much you use your phone it’s well worth the investment.. Apples best phone yet!!!!
"
12731,B08L5PVZ9Y,5,"
Now, this really is innovation, It was well worth an upgrade on my XS Max. Despite rumours of worse off battery life, I'm really happy with it alongside the new 5G which is so fast, it's faster than my wifi at home. The new camera is incredible, the clarity in each photo makes me feel like a professional photographer, the squared-off edges on the phone makes it easier to grip and the display is equally as stunning as the back of the phone, the new Pacific Blue colour is stunning.If you're looking at upgrading your phone, seriously consider this one. It is the best on the market by a long while, the only downside is the fact it does not ship with a charging plug, but you can use any USB-C adapter, or you can use your old iPhone charger but it just will charge slightly slower.

12732,B08L5PVZ9Y,5,"
This is a beast of a phone. It’s big, it’s solid and it’s fantastic. I was initially a little concerned about the size and new shape/design. I needn’t have been.The raw power on this phone is something else.  It’s fast smooth has a great updated camera and new improved screen.  Should you update from iPhone 11 Pro Max? No I don’t think so. But anything less, definitely, you won’t regret it.It’s a pity it still has the notch and no 120hz refresh rate. However neither spoils the enjoyment of this phone.Apple has done it agin, this is apples newest and greatest iPhone ever. The new design is superb.  You won’t regret buying this phone.

I debated long and hard whether to return to iPhone after over a decade away on Android. IOS has come on a long way, as have the iPhones themselves.  And so in March 2021, possibly not too far ahead of Apple’s iPhone 13, I decided to make the jump back.  I like the larger format phone, coming from 6.7in Android the screen size is going to be a complete shoe in for me.  And I must say that I am very pleased with the iPhone 12 Pro Max so far. It does perform very fast, the cameras are top of game, just about everything about the smartphone is spot on for me. I cannot truly fault it.

It’s painful for me to do a 2 star review for a IPhone especially for which I paid £1200.Here is why honestly I been an Apple fan for years and with all goods and bad still choose apple products. It’s not about being addicted to them but more to do with the stability of apps and absolutely never crash experience.However this time round the saturation level on disappointment just crossed or the bucket 🪣  of disappointment is full. I mean seriously felt annoyed.Let’s start from design, the good part is that it has more grip due to change is sides as compared to iPhone 11 but on the same note it looks very old style like iPhone 4.Moving forward battery life slightly better nothing amazing and that slightly is probably just because it’s new.Let’s get into nitty gritty of it and what it comes with. Well it come with Nothing !!! Yep can’t understand why no charger 🔌 no ear phones? But still charging same price.So in essence you have cut your cost of production on our expensive. Felt a bit cheeky.Now let’s talk about what new well there isn’t anything that’s super new on top of iPhone 11. It just feels same body with new shinny shirt.Anyways still gone keep it for the year but probably now it’s the last one.Still with all the negative don’t get me wrong still it’s probably the best and most premium but paying so much you expect something different and unique.May be too much to ask as there is everything already in previous  iPhones📱 but even then if you are paying so much premium you expect more.Hope that helps ... Thanks .

This is without doubt the best iPhone I have ever owned.Easy to set up, quick & responsive when using & the camera is such a bonus. I also get 250gb of storage built in.Only downside is the usual high pricing of apple products, but I suppose that’s the price of quality.

This is a decent upgrade from my previous iPhone 6. Easy to set up. The most noticeable improvement is the battery life - I only have to charge it every 2 days. The camera is excellent. I've managed to drop it once and the screen didn't crack. The facial recognition doesn't work well with a face covering - not that I expected it too - so the option of fingerprint recognition might have been useful during the Pandemic. Overall I'm very happy with it. (I've had it 4 months now.)

12757,B08L5PVZ9Y,5,"
Having read a number of reviews from various so called exports on leading computing web sites claiming that the iPhone 12 Pro Max was the ultimate phone - the best of the best - and seen first hand my girlfriends own iPhone 12 Pro, I decided that this would be my upgrade.My iPhone X 64 Gb was full up! The move to Apple Music was the main culprit, hogging more space than I’d anticipated. Ok, 512 Gb is a bit OTT right now, but we just don’t know what’s coming in the next few years do we!!Anyway, I’m pleased to report that yes, the probably is the best phone in the market right now - it’s awesome. Battery life is brilliant. Screen image amazing. Take the five payment option from Amazon - it makes the cost a little bit more manageable!If you’re a little hesitant - go on, take the plunge. You won’t regret it!
